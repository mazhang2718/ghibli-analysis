1
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:20,246
This is the sun, this is the moon,

2
00:00:20,856 --> 00:00:23,686
this mountain is really the earth,

3
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:30,326
and this is grandma.

4
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:54,316
My how splendid...

5
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:57,586
Hello, Mrs. Yamada.

6
00:00:57,956 --> 00:01:01,726
I've never seen such a magnificent...

7
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:04,796
Yup, they're my little babies.

8
00:01:04,896 --> 00:01:06,386
What species?

9
00:01:06,506 --> 00:01:09,336
This is a Mino Chrysanthemum, this is...

10
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,536
No, I mean the caterpillar.

11
00:01:15,716 --> 00:01:16,976
No idea.

12
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:21,676
Grow into a butterfly just as gaudy as that flower.

13
00:01:25,256 --> 00:01:27,156
Mother!

14
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:30,626
That's our grandma.

15
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:44,566
And my mother and me, Nonoko.

16
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:48,706
What am I going to make for dinner tonight...

17
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:55,746
I know, I'll go for it! Something really special!

18
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:57,146
What are we having?

19
00:01:57,486 --> 00:02:00,016
We had curry last week. Curry two days ago.

20
00:02:00,156 --> 00:02:02,416
Tonight... Curry!!

21
00:02:02,526 --> 00:02:03,586
What...

22
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:18,366
And this is my father and my older brother.

23
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:22,066
What's the use of all this studying, Dad?

24
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:24,736
Listen, Noboru.

25
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,446
Studying is not about what's useful or not.

26
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:33,216
The studying that seems useless may turn out to be useful.

27
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:35,786
On the other hand, it might be that

28
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,686
studying that doesn't seem not useful may not be,

29
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:43,226
but then studying that seems useless may then be useful.

30
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:47,426
But when you really need it,
it's not about useful or useless...

31
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:50,596
What are you going on about?

32
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:55,936
So I still have to study.

33
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:27,876
I get it...

34
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:32,376
If my father had been smart and really cool,

35
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:36,486
and my mother had been gorgeous and a great cook,

36
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:42,656
and our family had been rich, my whole life would've been different.

37
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:48,886
If at least one of them...

38
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,366
Don't be ridiculous.

39
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:55,596
If we hadn't married, there'd be no you, and no Nonoko.

40
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:58,996
Without the two of us, you wouldn't be here.

41
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,506
No, that's wrong.

42
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:06,006
If I had cooler parents, I'd just be their kid.

43
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:07,516
How stupid.

44
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:11,416
Don't you know about stamens and pistils?

45
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:12,506
You tell him.

46
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:14,316
You can't choose your parents.

47
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:18,916
No, I can't accept that. Something's not right.

48
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:23,196
Because I'm me, Dad's Dad and Mom's Mom.

49
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,396
What is that supposed to mean?

50
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:29,556
Who am I?

51
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:32,636
Where did I come from?

52
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:35,176
Where am I?

53
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:37,666
Who am I?

54
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:40,876
I get it...

55
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:45,786
So, there was a time when Dad and Mom weren't married.

56
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:14,716
Takashi and Matsuko are off to a great start in their new life.

57
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:17,446
Let's give them a warm send-off.

58
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:23,486
Congratulations, Takashi and Matsuko.

59
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:29,726
I also offer warm wishes to their parents and relatives.

60
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:40,766
Now, your prospects are boundless,

61
00:05:40,876 --> 00:05:45,976
and you're embarking for the wide open world, under billowing sails.

62
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:02,886
Life, as they say, has its ups and downs.

63
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:08,236
At times, the waves may taunt you, tossing you in their swells.

64
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,726
But take heart.

65
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:15,406
It's hard to stick with it and make it on your own,

66
00:06:16,046 --> 00:06:21,376
but even a couple of losers
can survive most things if they're together.

67
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:30,686
So listen, take my advice
and have children as soon as you can.

68
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:37,196
Children are the best reason for riding out life's storms.

69
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:51,736
Nowadays people say child-rearing
is challenging and difficult,

70
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:54,536
but we've done it from time immemorial.

71
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:58,006
Children grow even without parents.

72
00:07:58,316 --> 00:08:05,016
So hold them close to your heart as they crawl,
then walk. They'll be fine.

73
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:18,896
Children make you appreciate your own parents.

74
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,696
Parents may seem to do nothing but order you around,

75
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:26,936
but they'll baby-sit your kids
and sometimes give them toys.

76
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,106
Nowadays young people

77
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:35,736
turn that saying about appreciating parents
to their own advantage.

78
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:39,116
But I guess that's part of it too.

79
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:45,056
If things work out, you even get the real estate.

80
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:50,596
So Matsuko and Takashi,

81
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:53,796
start looking after your folks!

82
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:57,366
I hope you know the land is in my name.

83
00:08:57,476 --> 00:09:00,876
Excuse me, mother, but I built this house.

84
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:03,376
Without land, there's no house.

85
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,466
And we are grateful to you,

86
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:08,916
but I've worked hard, too.

87
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,716
Your room gets the best light.

88
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:13,416
Thanks for nothing.

89
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:17,546
Of course it does. It's on my land.

90
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:21,926
Besides, why do you always insist
you built it by yourself.

91
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:25,326
I hate to contradict you, but I definitely built...

92
00:09:25,436 --> 00:09:27,666
That's enough!

93
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,236
Both of you.

94
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:32,996
That's right! What's the point of all this bickering!

95
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,636
Listen to Noboru.

96
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:36,836
In the end, it'll all be mine.

97
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:06,196
And what should you fear most on this lifelong voyage?

98
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,076
Wild storms and rip tides?

99
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:21,476
No. Beware the calm waters,
when there's hardly a ripple in sight.

100
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:26,356
As long as a family holds each other tight, they can somehow

101
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:28,726
weather the wildest seas.

102
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:31,026
But calm waters are another story.

103
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:37,596
The wind dies down, you sigh and relax, loosening your clasp.

104
00:10:38,276 --> 00:10:41,076
But take care, Matsuko and Takashi!

105
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:48,916
If in the calm you selfishly please only yourselves,
you may lose each other.

106
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:57,346
You'll never see the sharks gathering around you.

107
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:06,026
And how will you guide your ship?

108
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:10,496
Without a wind, or even a course?

109
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:14,036
If you row blindly, right, no, left,

110
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:18,976
no, right after all, you'll never agree.

111
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:23,906
You may even wonder why you're stuck on the same boat at all.

112
00:11:24,756 --> 00:11:27,246
Your family's about to fall apart.

113
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:29,186
Turn right there!

114
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:30,226
You sure?

115
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:31,426
Turn left!

116
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:33,586
Right, right! No, left, left!

117
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:34,686
Which way!

118
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:36,356
Oh dear, maybe right.

119
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:37,986
Which is it!!??

120
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:48,676
We came so close...

121
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:49,866
Our turn!

122
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:01,816
Oh, no, this isn't the way.

123
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:03,386
You should've turned!

124
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:04,886
No, no, go straight!

125
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:07,296
No, it's that way, are you crazy?

126
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:09,026
It's this way, Dad!

127
00:12:09,226 --> 00:12:11,566
Quiet! All of you.

128
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:15,036
Nonoko's the only one who's quiet.

129
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:18,166
Hm...she's not here.

130
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:21,236
What?

131
00:12:21,746 --> 00:12:23,146
Where is she?

132
00:12:23,246 --> 00:12:25,176
Stop the car.

133
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:32,186
Where did we lose her?

134
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:35,686
Noboru, weren't you with her?

135
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:39,326
Yeah, while Dad and I were waiting for you.

136
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,396
Maybe she got bored and wandered off.

137
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,986
No, I remember her on the bench.

138
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:53,106
I'm so sorry.

139
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:57,006
What took you so long?

140
00:12:57,116 --> 00:12:59,946
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

141
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,376
I could have done some shopping, too.

142
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:05,346
I wanted to look at baseball bats.

143
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:12,956
I'm sure she's still there.

144
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:23,636
It's all because you kept yelling about how late we were.

145
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,966
Don't blame me. You're the ones who were late.

146
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:32,476
You all got so excited, you just left poor Nonoko behind.

150
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:35,876
Like you weren't there yourself, grandma.

151
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:39,116
We were looking for your flannel underwear!

152
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:42,246
The store'll close. I'll never make it.

153
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:44,726
Stop thinking about yourself.

154
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:47,916
What if something terrible happens to Nonoko?

155
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:49,986
Something terrible?

156
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,426
You don't mean...kidnapped!

157
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:58,436
She's so adorable, just like me.

158
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:02,566
This is no time for jokes!

159
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:06,966
If only that would work now.

160
00:14:07,086 --> 00:14:08,346
What do you mean, that?

161
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:10,176
The PTA mantra.

162
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:14,576
'Don't talk to strangers.'

163
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:17,686
That's what you teach children?

164
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:21,286
It's like saying all strangers are thieves.

165
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:23,866
Nonoko's fine. Those teeth!

166
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:27,836
Hey, cake! Gimmee some!

167
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:29,966
Just one bite.

168
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,196
OK!

169
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,666
One chomp of those teeth!

170
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:35,836
Enough!

171
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:44,046
Please move, our daughter may have been kidnapped!

172
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:49,426
We can't even call.

173
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:52,186
We should've called before.

174
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:53,856
I told you to buy a cell phone.

175
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,726
You keep quiet!

176
00:14:57,566 --> 00:15:00,726
Oh, Nonoko!

177
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,656
Are you lost?

178
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:33,496
Huh, so you're waiting for someone?

179
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:43,136
Who are you waiting for?

180
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:46,676
Can't you talk?

181
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:49,846
Then why don't you say anything?

182
00:15:50,256 --> 00:15:55,486
I'm not s'pposed to people I don't know.

183
00:15:55,786 --> 00:16:01,656
I know,'Don't talk to strangers.'

184
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:09,066
You're very grown-up, because you're careful.
You can talk now.

185
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,466
You should hear my story.

186
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:16,636
My father and mother and grandma and brother all got lost.

187
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,946
Did you lose someone?

188
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,946
My mommy.

189
00:16:22,186 --> 00:16:23,586
Your mommy?

190
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:27,686
My mommy went away...

191
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:31,986
I know...there've been a lot of missing parents lately...

192
00:16:32,596 --> 00:16:36,226
But it's only your mom, you'll find her.

193
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:45,036
Excuse me, this is Toshio Kimura.

194
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:47,236
Can you please call his mom?

195
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,336
Oh, he's lost?

196
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:50,846
No he's not, they were separated.

197
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:53,116
Right.

198
00:16:54,686 --> 00:16:57,616
And your first name, Mr. Kimura?

199
00:16:57,786 --> 00:16:58,846
- Toshio. - Toshio.

200
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:00,416
Toshio, then.

201
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:03,716
Wait here a minute, OK?

202
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,856
And you? Are you his sister?

203
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:10,716
No, no relation.

204
00:17:10,836 --> 00:17:13,856
My whole family's lost.

205
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:32,476
Poor little, poor little, lost pussy cat...

206
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,156
Stop crying, we're here.

207
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:14,056
What! She went with her mother!?!

208
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,256
I'm her mother!

209
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:17,996
Oh, is that so?

210
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:21,156
How dare you give her to a stranger!

211
00:18:21,436 --> 00:18:24,896
It may not have been her mother, but she was no stranger.

212
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:27,476
No stranger? Who could it be?

213
00:18:27,576 --> 00:18:29,136
I don't know anyone...

214
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,676
Someone pretending to be friendly...

215
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:37,816
No, she recognized Nonoko.

216
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:38,946
That wasn't her mother!

217
00:18:39,056 --> 00:18:41,246
Calm down! And then?

218
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,386
I'm terribly sorry.

219
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:50,696
Nonoko went off happily with someone
who seemed like her mother.

220
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:53,956
Oh no... Who can it be...

221
00:18:54,506 --> 00:18:56,436
Will you please page Nonoko?

222
00:18:56,606 --> 00:19:00,096
Actually...they went out that exit together.

223
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,036
Not here.

224
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:02,006
Come on!

225
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,776
That's some family...

226
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:21,496
Dad, where are you racing off to?

227
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:22,756
We're chasing it!

228
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:23,556
What?

229
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,066
The car Nonoko's in!

230
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,496
What kind of car?

231
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:36,766
We don't even know which way it went!

232
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:40,736
She'll be fine. Nonoko knew the lady, right?

233
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,876
I bet she took her home.

234
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,786
I'm sure Noboru's right.

235
00:19:46,856 --> 00:19:49,516
Sure, that must be it.

236
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:52,816
Don't be so sure. You can't trust anyone these days.

237
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,156
Mother!

238
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:57,666
Don't you think you should notify the police?

239
00:19:57,766 --> 00:19:58,826
The police!

240
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,766
How would we explain?

241
00:20:01,136 --> 00:20:03,226
Make a full confession.

242
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:04,236
Confession!

243
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:09,406
That four grown people
neglected and abandoned a young girl.

244
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:12,976
Say, does Nonoko have a key?

245
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:15,336
Let's go home!

246
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,176
Nonoko!

247
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:53,186
Nonoko!

248
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,676
Nonoko!

249
00:20:58,526 --> 00:20:59,546
Nonoko!

250
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,156
Not here.

251
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,136
Of course not, it was locked.

252
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:13,536
Hello.

253
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:17,776
Oh, thank goodness!

254
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:21,246
Thank you! Thank you so much!

255
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:26,346
Thank you! We were looking everywhere for her.

256
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:29,016
I'm so sorry for all this...

257
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:34,696
Yes, we'll be right over.

258
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:38,196
You even made her dinner...

259
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:44,396
You're so very kind, how can we possibly thank you...

260
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:52,406
They finally got home.

261
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:55,106
They're coming right over.

262
00:21:55,216 --> 00:21:56,776
I'm sorry, auntie.

263
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,186
Oh, it's nothing.

264
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:04,186
I can't wait to hear their side of the story.

265
00:22:22,846 --> 00:22:27,406
Look up and see, the blue skies,

266
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:31,246
the white clouds

267
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:37,356
One of these days, it'll all work out

268
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:02,446
- Next stop Luncheon Court.

269
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:15,826
What did you call this stop?

270
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:18,556
Can you stand back, ma'am?

272
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:27,696
Oh, dear, it started raining.

273
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,116
The laundry!

274
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,346
Huh?

275
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:49,926
What's the fuss?

276
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:57,766
That's right! I'd already brought it in.

277
00:23:57,876 --> 00:23:59,926
You never even hung it up!

278
00:24:01,646 --> 00:24:04,876
I'm going out. Can I get you anything?

279
00:24:05,216 --> 00:24:07,576
Oh! There was something...

280
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:12,686
What was it... Um...um...

281
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,516
OK, then, I'm going.

282
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:22,726
It's just that, oh, what was it...

283
00:24:34,476 --> 00:24:36,066
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

284
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:37,876
What is it!

285
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,616
Um, that is, um...

286
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,316
Why don't you just give up!

287
00:24:48,256 --> 00:24:50,016
Oh, bread!

288
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:55,566
Get it yourself!

289
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:57,886
Mom!

290
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:00,896
Money, money.

291
00:25:02,406 --> 00:25:03,696
I'm home.

292
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,936
I guess Mom's not here.

293
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:11,546
Wow, noodles.

294
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:13,906
And the water's boiling.

295
00:25:14,316 --> 00:25:17,246
Great, I'll go ahead and eat'em.

296
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:25,786
Oh, you're home.

297
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:37,566
You were hiding!

298
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:43,446
Say.

299
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:46,906
The bulb's out.

300
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:50,076
That's no good. Better change it.

301
00:25:51,486 --> 00:25:54,546
Oh, darn...no spares.

302
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:57,816
Just switch it with one you don't use.

303
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:01,296
Up we go.

304
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:06,356
I'm just borrowing it...

305
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:08,226
Ouch, it's hot.

306
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:13,536
Tea.

307
00:26:13,636 --> 00:26:14,736
Me, too.

308
00:26:14,846 --> 00:26:15,806
Me, too.

309
00:26:16,176 --> 00:26:19,946
I'm busy washing the dishes.
Get in here one of you!

310
00:26:22,686 --> 00:26:24,776
paper scissors rock

311
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:30,086
Get your cup out.

312
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:38,656
The dishes are all yours.

313
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:40,196
What!

314
00:26:41,406 --> 00:26:43,566
Mr. Tanaka says he's coming over.

315
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:45,836
What! Oh, no.

316
00:26:49,246 --> 00:26:51,216
Better tidy up a little.

317
00:26:56,686 --> 00:26:57,586
Ouch.

318
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:11,756
Hey, what are you doing?

319
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:14,166
I'll say we're spring cleaning!

321
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:29,276
It's on the kitchen table.

322
00:27:31,356 --> 00:27:32,786
No, it's not.

323
00:27:33,256 --> 00:27:35,486
Are you sure? I know I left it.

324
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:37,356
It isn't here.

325
00:27:37,926 --> 00:27:39,656
Where did you look?

326
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:42,886
It's a manila envelope that says OKK in red.

327
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:45,026
Is this it, sir?

328
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,636
Oh, uh...OK. Well,

329
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,436
if it's gone, it's gone.

330
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:55,706
Hey.

331
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:56,976
Here.

332
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:59,566
That's 20 years of marriage for you.

333
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:00,976
Gimme the paper.

334
00:28:01,086 --> 00:28:02,776
When I'm done.

335
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,216
Impressive.

336
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,486
Can you pick up a few things?

337
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:17,466
Sure.

338
00:28:17,736 --> 00:28:22,536
Lettuce, cucumber, ham, light bulbs and garbage bags.

339
00:28:22,906 --> 00:28:24,236
I'll make a list.

340
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,636
No, I've got it.

341
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:32,576
Lettuce, cucumber, ham,

342
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:35,276
light bulbs and garbage bags, right?

343
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:36,706
I told you.

344
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:39,416
It's not exactly like I forgot.

345
00:28:41,956 --> 00:28:44,286
Lettuce...cucumber...

346
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:52,026
Let's see...

347
00:28:54,106 --> 00:28:55,266
Make up your mind.

348
00:28:55,606 --> 00:28:58,006
Have you decided?

349
00:28:58,306 --> 00:29:00,276
Just hurry up.

350
00:29:03,706 --> 00:29:05,646
I'll take the Shanghai Special.

351
00:29:05,816 --> 00:29:06,976
Me too.

352
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,376
Two Shanghai Specials.

353
00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:17,656
Oh, you're still here?

354
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,346
What do you mean,'still'?

355
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:22,226
Can't I rest on my day off?

356
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:25,226
Usually, you're off at Pachinko.

357
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:29,036
Nope, I'm giving it a rest. How about some tea?

358
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:32,136
And noodles for lunch.

359
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:33,636
Yes, dear.

360
00:29:35,576 --> 00:29:38,736
Actually, make that coffee, not tea!

361
00:29:42,586 --> 00:29:46,016
And the bathroom's a wreck.

362
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:47,886
Clean it up.

363
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,816
And when you go shopping I need cigarettes.

364
00:29:51,926 --> 00:29:54,826
What a pain in the neck!

365
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:01,096
Honey, honey...

366
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:05,296
Where's your mother?

367
00:30:05,476 --> 00:30:07,136
Out playing Pachinko.

368
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:35,296
It's just about to start.

369
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,346
It's not over.

370
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:48,936
But I was looking forward to it.

371
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:50,146
No.

372
00:30:50,286 --> 00:30:51,776
It's a movie!

373
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:26,946
Now nobody can watch.

374
00:31:27,156 --> 00:31:29,216
This is much more fun.

375
00:31:45,176 --> 00:31:46,766
I win!

376
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:45,256
Hey, Noboru.

377
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:47,566
Wanna play catch?

378
00:32:48,706 --> 00:32:49,566
Yeah.

381
00:32:57,406 --> 00:33:01,146
Wait, the dad's supposed to be the catcher.

382
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,036
Give me a break.

383
00:33:05,786 --> 00:33:09,916
OK, this signal for a curve ball, this for a fastball,

384
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,916
and this for a slider.

385
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:14,026
Give me a break.

386
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,156
Two outs, bases loaded, you're the relief pitcher.

387
00:33:17,266 --> 00:33:20,026
I'm the starting pitcher type.

388
00:33:20,136 --> 00:33:21,756
Give me a break!

389
00:33:21,936 --> 00:33:23,566
Are you nuts?

390
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:26,166
The team never even lets you pitch.

391
00:33:26,276 --> 00:33:29,136
That's why I want to start now.

392
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:33,546
I see. OK, let's see this starting pitcher pitch.

393
00:33:34,586 --> 00:33:37,346
It's still two outs, bases loaded.

394
00:33:37,446 --> 00:33:38,546
What!

395
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:56,596
OK, pitch.

396
00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:03,346
God damn it!

397
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:09,206
What are you listening to?

398
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:15,286
Listening over and over will improve my English.

399
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:20,656
It's not that easy.

400
00:34:20,796 --> 00:34:22,486
In my experience...

401
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:23,616
Study!

402
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:25,496
Study!

403
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:29,056
Study!

404
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:51,826
It just doesn't work for me.

405
00:34:51,926 --> 00:34:53,156
I'm not you.

406
00:34:59,236 --> 00:35:01,166
How'bout a drop of sake?

407
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:01,926
Sure.

408
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:03,556
But, dear.

409
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:13,436
Pretty awful, huh?

410
00:35:16,016 --> 00:35:17,346
A little dry.

411
00:35:18,586 --> 00:35:19,576
What did you say!

412
00:35:19,716 --> 00:35:20,586
Have you been...

413
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,986
Noboru!

414
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:27,556
Noboru!

415
00:35:36,606 --> 00:35:39,436
Hey, Noboru, let's play catch.

416
00:35:41,146 --> 00:35:42,236
Why?

417
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:47,646
Why...? It's a form of parent-child bonding.

418
00:35:48,816 --> 00:35:51,046
Then it doesn't have to be catch.

419
00:35:51,386 --> 00:35:53,576
I get your point, but...

420
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:58,156
It's a matter of setting the right stage.

421
00:35:58,996 --> 00:36:01,016
Forget it. Can't be bothered.

422
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:18,866
Kids these days...

423
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,816
A serious generation gap...

425
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:39,326
Don't mix your rice into the soup.

426
00:36:39,436 --> 00:36:40,986
Listen to your father.

427
00:36:41,906 --> 00:36:43,926
Pour the soup over the rice.

428
00:36:46,676 --> 00:36:48,576
Excuse me, father...

429
00:36:49,846 --> 00:36:51,306
What? Got a problem with that?

430
00:36:52,046 --> 00:36:53,676
Oh, suit yourself.

431
00:36:59,456 --> 00:37:02,426
See, the water after the cement.

432
00:37:02,826 --> 00:37:04,846
Um...

433
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:07,656
Hmmm...

434
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:10,026
Control those chopsticks. It's rude.

435
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:13,956
Use your chopsticks with purpose.

436
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,456
That's my plate.

437
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:18,966
Excuse me.

438
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:22,236
You bit it, it's yours.

439
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:30,886
Help me think of an independent study topic.

440
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,446
Think for yourself.

441
00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:35,306
It's independent, free choice.

442
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:39,056
I know, but I'm coming up blank.

443
00:37:40,126 --> 00:37:42,326
You're free to do anything?

444
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,866
Right, free.

445
00:37:43,966 --> 00:37:45,156
But...

446
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:51,036
Total freedom makes it tough, doesn't it?

447
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:52,896
Exactly.

448
00:37:54,746 --> 00:37:56,236
Freedom, huh...

449
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:09,686
Absolute freedom of choice...

450
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:19,666
Glorious freedom... I dream of freedom...

451
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:23,226
But when it comes on a silver platter...

452
00:38:28,046 --> 00:38:30,376
I haven't got a clue what to do...

453
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,976
Now he's a philosopher.

454
00:38:38,286 --> 00:38:41,486
He's probably worrying about his own retirement.

456
00:38:57,266 --> 00:38:58,826
The first snow!

457
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:13,456
Let's take a picture in it!

458
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:15,776
Why?

459
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,686
You're hardly children anymore.

460
00:39:17,786 --> 00:39:19,786
Shut the door. It's cold.

461
00:39:46,956 --> 00:39:48,286
Where's the camera?

462
00:39:48,826 --> 00:39:51,726
In the top drawer.

463
00:39:58,166 --> 00:39:59,136
Is not!

464
00:40:03,866 --> 00:40:05,996
You should know where it is.

465
00:40:08,146 --> 00:40:10,136
This is the best part...

466
00:41:11,576 --> 00:41:14,636
A lone figure Back turned

470
00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:35,116
Ready!

471
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:37,056
Go!

472
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:37,896
Mine, mine,

473
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,056
Mother's, Matsuko's, Nonoko's...

474
00:41:55,986 --> 00:41:58,346
31 seconds! A new record.

475
00:41:59,956 --> 00:42:01,176
Not bad.

477
00:42:13,096 --> 00:42:14,366
Time to get up.

478
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:15,956
Dad, can you get me some cake?

479
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:17,036
Coke for me.

480
00:42:17,136 --> 00:42:17,996
The tangerines, too.

481
00:42:18,106 --> 00:42:20,436
And the stove needs kerosene.

482
00:42:23,146 --> 00:42:25,546
Thank you!

484
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:41,946
Can you bring my umbrella?

485
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:45,356
Your father needs his umbrella at the station.

486
00:42:45,636 --> 00:42:48,626
Why me? I'm studying.

487
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:52,196
You should go. Walk in the rain with your man.

488
00:42:52,306 --> 00:42:54,776
I just don't have the energy today.

489
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:55,776
But...

490
00:42:55,876 --> 00:42:59,176
Noboru! You go, please.

491
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:00,606
Make Nonoko go.

492
00:43:00,716 --> 00:43:03,016
Forget it! I'll buy one.

493
00:43:03,116 --> 00:43:05,316
Pick up some pork, too?

494
00:43:05,656 --> 00:43:06,546
No Way!

495
00:44:36,906 --> 00:44:40,106
Strange... Where's Noboru's sock...

496
00:44:40,216 --> 00:44:43,476
Nonoko's pajamas and Dad's towel?

497
00:44:44,116 --> 00:44:45,746
Pajamas? Socks?

498
00:44:45,856 --> 00:44:47,446
And his towel.

499
00:44:51,226 --> 00:44:52,746
Hey, wait...

500
00:44:54,556 --> 00:44:56,356
This means...

501
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,996
I knew it!

502
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:07,036
The Black Hole!

504
00:45:10,846 --> 00:45:14,006
Maybe we'll order sushi in for dinner...

505
00:45:15,386 --> 00:45:19,976
Oh, what a waste of money! I'll make the sushi.

506
00:45:20,356 --> 00:45:22,186
Just as I hoped...

507
00:45:26,796 --> 00:45:28,916
Say, mother...

508
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:32,926
Sushi's not interesting. I thought I'd go gourmet.

509
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:37,696
I see...So what is it?

510
00:45:37,806 --> 00:45:40,636
Beef Stroganoga...

511
00:45:40,736 --> 00:45:42,906
Don't cook what you can't spell.

512
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,406
Well, excuse me!

513
00:45:46,116 --> 00:45:49,346
It's Beef Stroganoff, right?

514
00:45:49,616 --> 00:45:51,376
You knew all along.

515
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,386
I know very well.

516
00:45:53,756 --> 00:45:58,316
Beef Stroganoga is just the Strogaffgaff of beef.

517
00:45:58,426 --> 00:46:00,896
Whatever, just make it.

518
00:46:02,196 --> 00:46:05,496
Darn. I was really counting on sushi.

519
00:46:20,516 --> 00:46:24,276
No good. I screwed it up. Order the sushi.

521
00:46:30,486 --> 00:46:33,356
Wow, miso soup, fried egg and seaweed.

522
00:46:34,496 --> 00:46:36,826
A real Japanese breakfast.

523
00:46:36,926 --> 00:46:38,986
Well, actually...

524
00:46:41,636 --> 00:46:43,106
Nonoko's leftovers?

525
00:46:45,206 --> 00:46:46,226
Yesterday's soup?

526
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:49,176
Extra seaweed from lunch?

527
00:46:50,376 --> 00:46:52,036
Precisely!

528
00:46:53,216 --> 00:46:55,506
Today's your lucky day.

529
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:56,916
Hardly!

530
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:01,056
Take care.

531
00:47:03,486 --> 00:47:04,816
Matsuko...

532
00:47:13,996 --> 00:47:16,696
When's lunch, Matsuko?

533
00:47:18,606 --> 00:47:23,236
What are you talking about? We just ate.

534
00:47:23,706 --> 00:47:25,976
You're too young to be senile.

535
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:27,706
You sure...?

536
00:47:27,816 --> 00:47:31,776
The noodles, a few... Oops!

537
00:47:35,056 --> 00:47:37,186
I ate them all myself...

538
00:47:37,286 --> 00:47:38,256
Hey!

539
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:47,366
What's for dinner?

540
00:47:47,796 --> 00:47:49,026
Shabu shabu.

541
00:47:51,266 --> 00:47:53,606
We have it all the time.

542
00:47:53,706 --> 00:47:56,266
Shabu shabu's perfect for winter.

543
00:48:00,146 --> 00:48:02,236
OK, help yourselves.

544
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,746
This way, she doesn't have to cook.

545
00:48:06,586 --> 00:48:06,616
Cold noodles for lunch again?

546
00:48:06,616 --> 00:48:09,106
Cold noodles for lunch again?

547
00:48:09,226 --> 00:48:10,986
That's what we had yesterday!

548
00:48:11,086 --> 00:48:13,386
And the day before.

549
00:48:13,496 --> 00:48:15,086
That doesn't make sense!

550
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,696
And again tomorrow!?

551
00:48:18,866 --> 00:48:22,326
Noodles! What else?

552
00:48:23,236 --> 00:48:26,166
Lots of free ginger in the garden to go with it.

554
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,946
The ginger's good in miso soup.

555
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:39,816
Yes, though they do say it makes you forgetful.

556
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:43,116
Oh dear. He left his bag.

557
00:48:43,956 --> 00:48:47,116
He's bound to notice. He can't be that dumb.

558
00:48:47,696 --> 00:48:48,526
Right.

559
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:50,186
Oh, no, I forgot...

560
00:49:00,006 --> 00:49:02,066
...to take of my pajamas!

561
00:49:06,746 --> 00:49:07,606
I'm off.

562
00:49:07,716 --> 00:49:08,776
OK.

563
00:49:11,186 --> 00:49:12,646
Have a nice day.

564
00:49:17,356 --> 00:49:18,616
I'm off.

565
00:49:21,796 --> 00:49:23,026
My shoes!

566
00:49:27,436 --> 00:49:28,796
Mom, look!

567
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:31,196
Dad!

568
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:33,236
What's all the fuss!

569
00:49:33,976 --> 00:49:34,666
My train!

570
00:49:34,776 --> 00:49:36,006
I'll be late!

571
00:49:36,746 --> 00:49:38,436
Be careful.

572
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:43,776
I'm off to school.

573
00:49:44,216 --> 00:49:46,186
Off you go...

574
00:49:47,286 --> 00:49:51,246
Can't even close the door behind them.

575
00:50:00,796 --> 00:50:02,136
What's this?

576
00:50:02,236 --> 00:50:04,996
Oh, Nonoko forgot her lunch.

577
00:50:05,106 --> 00:50:06,626
She needs it by noon?

578
00:50:06,736 --> 00:50:08,466
Sure, but...

579
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:12,366
Fine, I'll take it to her when I go shopping.

580
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,966
That'll really be a help.

581
00:50:19,856 --> 00:50:21,186
I'm off.

582
00:50:21,286 --> 00:50:23,726
OK. Thank you.

583
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:30,486
What's this?

584
00:50:33,466 --> 00:50:36,956
Oh, no, she's forgotten her purse and everything.

585
00:50:40,576 --> 00:50:42,006
She'll be back.

586
00:50:46,816 --> 00:50:48,876
Watch the house, OK?

587
00:50:53,616 --> 00:50:56,516
Oh no! I left the kettle on.

588
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:04,196
Mrs. Yamada, delivery!

589
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:07,726
Are they out?

590
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:12,496
No, they're in.

591
00:51:13,376 --> 00:51:14,926
Oh, Mrs. Yamada.

592
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,206
Oh, I did turn it off.

593
00:51:22,886 --> 00:51:24,946
Were you robbed?

594
00:51:36,066 --> 00:51:37,586
Here's your package.

595
00:51:39,066 --> 00:51:40,966
Oh, thank you.

596
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:42,626
Your seal...?

597
00:51:42,736 --> 00:51:44,206
Oh, sorry.

598
00:51:44,606 --> 00:51:48,506
Let's see... Where do I keep it?

599
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:52,166
It's in the back of the second drawer.

600
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,106
Oh, goodness...

601
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,576
Always a pleasure.

602
00:51:57,686 --> 00:51:58,916
Thank you.

603
00:52:02,386 --> 00:52:05,086
I delivered Nonoko's lunch.

604
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:09,596
Why mother, I thought you were going shopping.

605
00:52:09,866 --> 00:52:12,596
Oops, I forgot.

606
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,236
Too much ginger...!

608
00:52:37,086 --> 00:52:38,056
Say...

609
00:52:41,996 --> 00:52:43,826
Is it Mahler...

610
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:50,626
I didn't know she was a classical music fan...

611
00:53:09,556 --> 00:53:13,046
Art is Brief Life is Long

612
00:53:18,426 --> 00:53:20,556
They're in full bloom.

613
00:53:25,136 --> 00:53:29,336
I wonder how many more times I'll see the cherry blossoms.

614
00:53:30,246 --> 00:53:34,946
Don't be silly, mother. You're only 70.

615
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:38,446
Maybe 30 more...

616
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:53,493
Mom, will you go pay the taxes?

617
00:53:53,593 --> 00:53:54,823
Leave it to me.

618
00:53:57,203 --> 00:53:59,363
You hand it to the clerk, got that?

619
00:53:59,473 --> 00:54:02,563
I know. Don't treat me like a child.

620
00:54:07,373 --> 00:54:11,403
Oh, dear, what a terrible calamity...

621
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:14,783
I'm really going senile.

622
00:54:15,883 --> 00:54:17,253
Nice to see you.

623
00:54:17,353 --> 00:54:19,653
Take care, bye.

624
00:54:24,023 --> 00:54:26,323
I put it in the mail box!

625
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:37,493
Why, Shige... Thanks for coming to visit.

626
00:54:37,773 --> 00:54:41,213
Well, I heard you were suddenly hospitalized.

627
00:54:41,413 --> 00:54:44,473
You'll never believe it...

628
00:54:44,843 --> 00:54:46,643
Have a seat.

629
00:54:54,923 --> 00:54:55,953
You see...

630
00:54:56,063 --> 00:54:57,083
Yes.

631
00:54:58,663 --> 00:54:59,723
Look.

632
00:55:00,663 --> 00:55:03,863
See the guy visiting that patient over there?

633
00:55:04,303 --> 00:55:07,763
I'm sure they're having an affair.

634
00:55:07,873 --> 00:55:09,233
What!

635
00:55:12,243 --> 00:55:13,873
Are you...?

636
00:55:14,143 --> 00:55:18,943
They definitely look suspicious to me!

637
00:55:22,423 --> 00:55:24,513
Suspicious, right?

638
00:55:29,323 --> 00:55:31,053
This is a special room.

639
00:55:31,163 --> 00:55:35,653
That notorious city councilman
accused of corruption is in there now.

640
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:43,793
I occasionally come up here for a breath of fresh air.

641
00:55:50,843 --> 00:55:53,943
These noodles are pretty good, right?

642
00:55:54,883 --> 00:55:56,083
They are.

643
00:56:00,593 --> 00:56:05,493
But the coffee's really lousy here.

644
00:56:07,193 --> 00:56:11,433
By the way, why are you in the hospital?

645
00:56:18,443 --> 00:56:20,003
Oh, Shige...!

646
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:31,453
No sign of death's approach
In the ciccada's voices - Basho

647
00:56:37,263 --> 00:56:39,093
Why, mother.

648
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:43,093
Turn on the light.

649
00:56:44,003 --> 00:56:47,763
Oh, I hadn't noticed it getting dark.

650
00:56:59,053 --> 00:57:02,573
Noboru! Turn off your light.

651
00:57:02,683 --> 00:57:04,013
I'm not asleep!

652
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:09,193
Age Comes More Easily Than Wisdom

653
00:57:10,223 --> 00:57:13,993
Five problems left. I'm so sleepy.

654
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:19,223
A hot bath will wake you up.

655
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:36,423
In you go.

656
00:57:44,063 --> 00:57:44,993
Feel better?

657
00:57:45,163 --> 00:57:47,153
Yup! I'm wide awake.

658
00:57:50,003 --> 00:57:53,663
OK, here goes!

659
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:57,563
Here goes, here goes...

660
00:57:58,543 --> 00:58:00,163
Here...goes...

661
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:14,023
You're as limp as a noodle.

662
00:58:15,453 --> 00:58:17,723
Don't give up.

663
00:58:17,893 --> 00:58:22,763
In a fire, the first 5 minutes count.
In a test, it's the last 5 minutes.

664
00:58:30,143 --> 00:58:34,003
Time's up. Turn in your papers.

665
00:58:38,113 --> 00:58:39,303
Ma'm!

666
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:43,183
Tanaka felt sick and had to go to the nurse's office!

667
00:58:43,623 --> 00:58:44,713
Yes...

668
00:58:44,923 --> 00:58:47,083
We deserve make-up time!

669
00:58:48,093 --> 00:58:49,213
Forget it.

670
00:58:54,793 --> 00:58:57,233
Put them in the upstairs closet?

671
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:58,193
Sure.

672
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,193
Noboru's studying like a demon.

673
00:59:30,103 --> 00:59:33,463
But the exams are over.

674
00:59:33,573 --> 00:59:35,333
He did miserably.

675
00:59:47,113 --> 00:59:49,983
About Noboru's tutor.

676
00:59:50,483 --> 00:59:51,973
He really needs one?

677
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:54,353
He's my son, after all.

678
00:59:54,453 --> 00:59:55,853
You've got a point.

679
00:59:58,993 --> 01:00:02,793
But isn't it expensive?

680
01:00:03,203 --> 01:00:07,003
$300 for 2 sessions with a university student.

681
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,573
What!

682
01:00:09,403 --> 01:00:11,673
For $300, I'll teach him.

683
01:00:11,773 --> 01:00:14,473
I'll teach him for $200.

684
01:00:15,943 --> 01:00:18,383
Pay me $100 and I'll work harder!

685
01:00:21,553 --> 01:00:24,853
This is getting us nowhere...

686
01:00:30,523 --> 01:00:37,933
Fleeting dreams An octopus making its home
in a trap A summer moon - Basho

687
01:00:45,243 --> 01:00:46,363
I'm home!

688
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,043
Look, chocolates!

689
01:00:57,223 --> 01:01:02,423
Mommy! Noboru bought chocolates!

690
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:05,283
They were a Valentine's Day present!

692
01:01:09,163 --> 01:01:10,033
Gone!

693
01:01:10,603 --> 01:01:12,193
Gone, gone, gone!

694
01:01:12,303 --> 01:01:13,533
I'm home!

695
01:01:14,733 --> 01:01:17,203
Where are those cookies, Nonoko!

696
01:01:17,343 --> 01:01:18,393
I ate them.

697
01:01:18,603 --> 01:01:21,943
What! I got them for a girl!

698
01:01:22,043 --> 01:01:23,243
But...

699
01:01:23,343 --> 01:01:24,873
No ifs ands or buts!

700
01:01:25,183 --> 01:01:28,043
Mommy already ate half.

701
01:01:28,153 --> 01:01:29,643
Mother...?

702
01:01:40,233 --> 01:01:43,163
Damn...I forgot my umbrella.

703
01:01:43,463 --> 01:01:44,833
Hey, Yamada!

704
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:47,293
Use my umbrella.

705
01:01:47,673 --> 01:01:48,833
How'bout you?

706
01:01:48,933 --> 01:01:50,163
I'll be fine.

707
01:01:52,073 --> 01:01:55,173
Say, Tanaka, I forgot my umbrella!

708
01:01:55,983 --> 01:01:58,443
Too bad. Don't catch cold.

709
01:02:07,253 --> 01:02:08,723
Rejected.

710
01:02:10,463 --> 01:02:11,353
No!

711
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:14,383
Give it back!

712
01:02:14,493 --> 01:02:15,553
Not after that.

713
01:02:15,663 --> 01:02:16,793
But it's mine.

714
01:02:16,903 --> 01:02:17,893
Thanks for the favor.

715
01:02:18,003 --> 01:02:19,123
Give it back!

716
01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:21,433
Guess it's a rain date.

717
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:27,803
Hey, Nakamura.

718
01:02:28,013 --> 01:02:29,843
Back to sock the teacher?

719
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:33,843
Don't be stupid. I came to tell him I got into college.

720
01:02:34,413 --> 01:02:36,283
Wow, you made it!

721
01:02:42,293 --> 01:02:43,313
Sir...?

722
01:02:43,423 --> 01:02:44,623
No need to run...

723
01:02:44,993 --> 01:02:46,123
from Nakamura.

724
01:02:46,233 --> 01:02:48,993
Idiot! Don't believe the rumors.

725
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,733
Hey, Yamada, Yamashita,

726
01:02:53,403 --> 01:02:55,233
let's buy some dirty books.

727
01:03:08,283 --> 01:03:09,213
Hey!

728
01:03:10,123 --> 01:03:10,953
Shoot!

729
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:14,283
What a coincidence.

730
01:03:18,323 --> 01:03:22,393
Tragedy in Bosnia...! You've got serious taste.

731
01:03:22,493 --> 01:03:25,733
Well, Japan's part of a bigger world.

732
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:29,633
Can I borrow it later?

733
01:03:32,443 --> 01:03:34,173
A real tragedy...

734
01:03:37,483 --> 01:03:38,643
I'm home.

735
01:03:41,213 --> 01:03:42,183
Noboru,

736
01:03:43,683 --> 01:03:45,053
the textbook?

737
01:03:45,153 --> 01:03:46,053
This?

738
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:48,613
I gave you $10 for it.

739
01:03:48,893 --> 01:03:50,253
I want to see it.

740
01:04:08,073 --> 01:04:09,603
'F-1 Racing for Students'

741
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:11,303
What is this!

742
01:04:12,513 --> 01:04:15,243
'Formula-1 Racing for Students'?

743
01:04:15,353 --> 01:04:18,683
It'll help my English and my geography.

744
01:04:20,553 --> 01:04:21,483
You idiot!

745
01:04:22,223 --> 01:04:23,983
You're the one who gave me

746
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:27,723
'The Power Ranger's ABC' when I was 3!

747
01:04:28,533 --> 01:04:31,793
Noboru, there's a girl on the phone.

748
01:04:31,903 --> 01:04:33,133
What!

749
01:04:39,813 --> 01:04:40,903
Oh, hello...

750
01:04:41,943 --> 01:04:43,373
Oh, yeah, it's me...

751
01:04:54,623 --> 01:04:56,283
Go away!

752
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:01,953
Oh, no, nothing.

753
01:05:03,703 --> 01:05:07,363
Yeah, yeah, OK.

754
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:12,793
A girlfriend...with his looks?

755
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:14,103
A real girlfriend?

756
01:05:14,213 --> 01:05:15,543
His face is red.

757
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:17,743
Yeah, OK.

758
01:05:18,113 --> 01:05:19,943
Bye, then.

759
01:05:32,093 --> 01:05:33,923
It's pounding away!

760
01:05:34,033 --> 01:05:35,223
An irregular heartbeat?

761
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:36,563
Let's see.

762
01:05:47,773 --> 01:05:49,263
Do you think he's upset?

763
01:05:49,373 --> 01:05:52,173
You insulted him, mother.

764
01:05:52,283 --> 01:05:55,613
This, from the paragon of motherhood?

765
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:50,163
The scent of plums On a mountain path
Suddenly dawn - Basho

767
01:06:54,913 --> 01:06:56,343
I'm home...

768
01:06:56,483 --> 01:06:58,103
Welcome back.

770
01:07:09,093 --> 01:07:10,323
I'm hungry.

771
01:07:12,493 --> 01:07:13,693
Anything to eat?

772
01:07:14,293 --> 01:07:15,453
Coming right up.

773
01:07:23,203 --> 01:07:25,263
Red bean cake or banana.

774
01:07:28,573 --> 01:07:33,143
Who the hell would want to come home to bean cakes

775
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:35,983
after working hard all day!

776
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:39,143
OK, a banana.

777
01:07:39,693 --> 01:07:43,493
What a jerk! Who wants a banana!

778
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:39,873
Turn towards me I'm lonely too The autumn dusk - Basho

779
01:09:42,013 --> 01:09:45,743
Mom's down with a cold. We'll get take-out tonight.

780
01:09:45,843 --> 01:09:46,503
Seaweed-rice special.

781
01:09:46,613 --> 01:09:47,703
Me too!

782
01:09:47,813 --> 01:09:49,043
I'll have the salmon-rice.

783
01:09:49,883 --> 01:09:51,373
How'bout you, mother?

784
01:09:51,753 --> 01:09:53,273
The combination special.

785
01:09:55,223 --> 01:09:56,453
I'll go get it!

786
01:09:56,563 --> 01:09:58,223
Not so fast!

787
01:10:02,063 --> 01:10:04,463
Tempura-rice for me!

790
01:10:10,073 --> 01:10:11,503
That's good.

791
01:10:13,773 --> 01:10:15,763
Hey, hey, lady...

792
01:10:17,443 --> 01:10:19,073
You can't do that!

793
01:10:19,613 --> 01:10:22,083
What? But this is...

794
01:10:22,953 --> 01:10:26,983
It's empty now, but someone may put a poster up.
There's an election.

795
01:10:27,093 --> 01:10:29,213
But, mister...

796
01:10:31,863 --> 01:10:34,193
This was the only thing underneath.

797
01:10:42,003 --> 01:10:44,703
If it isn't old Saburo...

798
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:49,173
This is my territory.

799
01:10:49,413 --> 01:10:52,073
Oh, it's you, Shige.

800
01:10:52,343 --> 01:10:55,443
We might as well work together, we're volunteers.

801
01:11:00,853 --> 01:11:03,723
You're on that side, I'm on this.

802
01:11:05,193 --> 01:11:06,783
Don't cross over.

803
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:11,363
Oh, boy, she hasn't changed a bit in 60 years.

804
01:11:13,873 --> 01:11:17,233
Oh, no, I forgot to take out the garbage...

805
01:11:20,313 --> 01:11:22,363
Oh, well, I'll have to sort it!

806
01:11:22,473 --> 01:11:26,003
Why sort burnables?

807
01:11:27,213 --> 01:11:29,043
Trash can at the station,

808
01:11:29,153 --> 01:11:32,173
Nonoko does the park, Noboru does the store.

809
01:11:32,983 --> 01:11:34,143
You can't do that!

810
01:11:34,253 --> 01:11:36,743
Why not? It's a great plan.

811
01:11:37,093 --> 01:11:37,753
Off we go.

812
01:11:37,863 --> 01:11:39,383
See you later.

813
01:11:41,493 --> 01:11:42,293
Ouch!

814
01:11:42,533 --> 01:11:46,933
Here I volunteer cleaning up the park
and you dump trash there!

815
01:11:47,033 --> 01:11:50,263
I'm not dumping, just using the public trash cans.

816
01:11:50,573 --> 01:11:52,203
That's the problem!

817
01:11:52,303 --> 01:11:54,303
Mom...

818
01:12:09,053 --> 01:12:11,053
The Fight for Justice

819
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:12,823
Excuse us!

820
01:12:15,863 --> 01:12:17,663
Our ball fell in...

821
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:26,803
This new one or this rubber ball?

822
01:12:28,843 --> 01:12:30,333
The rubber ball!

823
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:44,123
Honesty's the best policy. Don't ever lie.

824
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:45,863
OK.

825
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:48,193
Take this one too.

826
01:12:49,363 --> 01:12:50,663
Wow! Thanks!

827
01:12:58,543 --> 01:13:01,803
Excuse me... Our ball fell in yesterday...

828
01:13:01,913 --> 01:13:03,273
But you weren't here.

829
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:05,843
Didn't see any.

830
01:13:06,853 --> 01:13:08,143
I see...

831
01:13:09,453 --> 01:13:12,283
I'm sure this was the house.

832
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:22,553
I beg you, please tell those boys
to give him his new ball back.

833
01:13:29,173 --> 01:13:31,333
Oh, poor things.

834
01:13:31,443 --> 01:13:35,273
You're right, they're all wilted.

835
01:13:35,873 --> 01:13:38,713
Not the flowers! The accident!

836
01:13:38,943 --> 01:13:40,343
Oh, I see.

837
01:13:41,013 --> 01:13:43,073
It was a motor cycle gang.

838
01:13:44,383 --> 01:13:47,283
The poor guard rail.

839
01:13:47,393 --> 01:13:48,443
Mother!

840
01:13:48,553 --> 01:13:52,683
It was the poor child's parents who suffered...

841
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:29,533
They're so loud, has to be a motorcycle gang.

842
01:14:29,893 --> 01:14:31,453
They're by the park.

843
01:14:31,933 --> 01:14:34,763
They're the litterbugs!

844
01:14:34,873 --> 01:14:36,233
I'll go scold them.

845
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:38,133
That's dangerous, mother!

846
01:14:38,243 --> 01:14:40,933
Someone was recently murdered for that.

848
01:14:43,483 --> 01:14:45,533
Hmm, I know.

849
01:14:54,293 --> 01:14:56,023
That's worse!

850
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:07,363
Mm...mother! Why the get up?

851
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:10,403
Says she's scolding the motorcycle gang.

852
01:15:10,503 --> 01:15:12,733
Won't you stop her, please.

853
01:15:13,313 --> 01:15:19,243
You can't wear that hard-hat.
It's a momento from when we built the house.

854
01:15:19,713 --> 01:15:22,743
Oh. Well that's too bad.

855
01:15:22,953 --> 01:15:25,883
I'm sorry, but you can't.

856
01:15:26,283 --> 01:15:27,443
In that case,

857
01:15:27,553 --> 01:15:29,953
you wear it and go.

858
01:15:30,123 --> 01:15:31,613
I go!?

859
01:15:32,423 --> 01:15:37,123
They're not vicious. They'll go home eventually.

860
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:40,093
Then you have nothing to fear.

861
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:43,763
Give them a manly scolding. You're older.

862
01:15:44,303 --> 01:15:45,293
Manly...?

863
01:15:45,403 --> 01:15:47,173
But mother...

864
01:15:47,273 --> 01:15:49,643
I know, let's report them to 911.

865
01:15:49,743 --> 01:15:54,143
The poor kids. They don't deserve
a criminal record for making noise.

866
01:15:54,453 --> 01:15:55,673
A record!

867
01:16:12,533 --> 01:16:14,123
See, they're gone.

868
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:16,573
You think?

869
01:16:26,813 --> 01:16:28,073
What did I tell you?

870
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:33,053
We're relying on you.

871
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:39,023
All right, I'll just go look.

872
01:16:41,493 --> 01:16:43,893
Be careful, dear!

873
01:17:31,983 --> 01:17:34,073
Um, excuse me...

874
01:17:34,513 --> 01:17:35,913
What do you want?

875
01:17:36,013 --> 01:17:38,783
It's awfully late.

876
01:17:39,123 --> 01:17:40,453
Yeah? So what?

877
01:17:43,723 --> 01:17:45,353
Got a problem?

878
01:17:45,463 --> 01:17:49,223
N, no, we can work this out. I don't have a problem...

879
01:17:49,563 --> 01:17:54,623
I don't have a problem, but I do have a request.

880
01:17:54,873 --> 01:17:55,863
Spit it out.

881
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,473
Ask away, old man.

882
01:18:00,373 --> 01:18:03,103
Would you mind turning off your headlight.

883
01:18:03,343 --> 01:18:06,113
So that's your request, then?

884
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:08,083
Um, n, no.

885
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:10,173
Whaddya want then?

886
01:18:15,153 --> 01:18:20,653
Come, come fireflies,
this water's bitter, this water's sweet

887
01:18:20,763 --> 01:18:21,993
What is that!

888
01:18:33,773 --> 01:18:35,203
That old bag's nuts.

889
01:18:35,813 --> 01:18:37,503
Mother, are you all right!?

890
01:18:41,253 --> 01:18:42,843
An old bag, huh?

891
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:47,213
At least turn down that putt-putt.
You're a neighborhood nuisance.

892
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:49,783
M, mother, you can't talk to these low-lifes.

893
01:18:49,893 --> 01:18:51,653
Who you calling low-life!

894
01:18:51,763 --> 01:18:54,253
How exciting!

895
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:56,993
What a great voice, you have.

896
01:18:57,103 --> 01:18:58,533
Mother!

897
01:18:58,703 --> 01:19:02,363
And a fine face and physique to go with it.

898
01:19:02,473 --> 01:19:05,633
I bet people shut up when you talk.

899
01:19:05,973 --> 01:19:07,033
Get to the point!

900
01:19:07,673 --> 01:19:11,873
Really scary. You sure shut this guy up in a hurry.

901
01:19:11,983 --> 01:19:12,873
A cinch.

902
01:19:12,983 --> 01:19:18,313
When you yell at people,
it reminds me of a snake staring down a frog.

903
01:19:20,293 --> 01:19:26,123
It sure must be fun shutting people up
and ordering them around.

904
01:19:26,323 --> 01:19:27,053
It's OK.

905
01:19:27,163 --> 01:19:32,823
I know, why don't you employ your venom
in the cause of justice?

906
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:34,323
What?

907
01:19:34,633 --> 01:19:38,573
Don't you like fighting for justice,
that Masked Rider stuff?

908
01:19:40,343 --> 01:19:41,813
Way old, granny.

909
01:19:41,913 --> 01:19:46,103
Of course, it's not exactly cool, is it? Nowadays,

910
01:19:46,283 --> 01:19:49,913
we turn a blind eye to every kind of misdeed.

911
01:19:50,013 --> 01:19:53,923
But I know you could do it. Because you're fearless.

912
01:19:55,723 --> 01:19:59,663
Someone tosses a cigarette butt or can from their car,

913
01:19:59,763 --> 01:20:03,453
you use that voice of yours, make'em pick it up.

914
01:20:04,563 --> 01:20:08,053
You see a kid causing trouble on the subway,

915
01:20:08,173 --> 01:20:11,003
you gently tap him on the shoulder.

916
01:20:11,603 --> 01:20:15,133
I'm sure anyone will do whatever you say.

917
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:20,233
We'll all be so happy, we'll cheer you on.

918
01:20:23,153 --> 01:20:27,143
It's nice to be appreciated.

919
01:20:27,553 --> 01:20:30,043
While you're at it, scare off thugs,

920
01:20:30,153 --> 01:20:34,063
and take the bad guys' money.

921
01:20:35,533 --> 01:20:40,363
What do you say, will you heed an old bag's plea
and fight for justice?

922
01:20:40,533 --> 01:20:45,233
It'll be a whole lot better
than listening to me rant and rave.

923
01:20:47,443 --> 01:20:49,963
I think this old lady's nuts.

924
01:20:50,943 --> 01:20:52,673
No go?

925
01:20:52,913 --> 01:20:57,643
What a shame, with your godly attributes.

926
01:21:00,753 --> 01:21:01,743
Outta here!

927
01:21:09,393 --> 01:21:11,893
Think about fighting for justice!

928
01:21:17,643 --> 01:21:19,003
Hey, you forgot this.

929
01:21:31,123 --> 01:21:32,453
Did he get it?

930
01:21:32,553 --> 01:21:34,353
Mother!

931
01:21:48,073 --> 01:21:51,633
Noboru! Nonoko!

932
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:53,633
Mother!

933
01:22:47,633 --> 01:22:50,533
It's the Masked Rider!

934
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:32,763
The Masked Rider!

935
01:24:16,513 --> 01:24:18,683
Help...

936
01:24:28,493 --> 01:24:29,863
Mother!

937
01:24:30,493 --> 01:24:31,893
Noboru!

938
01:24:33,503 --> 01:24:35,263
Nonoko...

939
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:51,683
Thank you, Masked Rider!

940
01:25:39,733 --> 01:25:45,403
How cruel A grasshopper
trapped Under a warrior's helmet - Basho

941
01:25:53,243 --> 01:25:54,343
I'm home.

942
01:25:54,553 --> 01:25:56,783
Did you bring your umbrella home?

943
01:25:57,683 --> 01:26:01,553
Your husband's home from work, exhausted, and

944
01:26:01,653 --> 01:26:05,883
all you can ask is'did you bring your umbrella home!'

945
01:26:05,993 --> 01:26:08,753
OK, OK. Welcome home. Have a hard day?

946
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:10,793
Where's your umbrella?

947
01:26:11,703 --> 01:26:13,063
I forgot it.

948
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:20,003
Welcome home.

949
01:26:20,103 --> 01:26:24,943
Look, I remembered to bring it home, so there, ha!

950
01:26:29,053 --> 01:26:32,023
What? Got a problem?

951
01:26:33,223 --> 01:26:36,953
But you didn't take an umbrella today.

952
01:26:39,063 --> 01:26:39,953
See?

954
01:26:43,363 --> 01:26:44,693
I bought a cake.

955
01:26:44,803 --> 01:26:45,783
Really?

956
01:26:47,263 --> 01:26:49,703
Once in a blue moon...

957
01:26:50,503 --> 01:26:52,973
Guilty conscience?

958
01:26:53,073 --> 01:26:53,803
What was that!

959
01:26:53,903 --> 01:26:58,073
That's going too far.
Here Takashi's thoughtfully gone and...

960
01:26:58,183 --> 01:26:59,773
I even bought custard.

961
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:03,813
Now that's suspicious.

962
01:27:07,553 --> 01:27:12,993
Nonoko! Noboru! Your father got cake!

963
01:27:19,963 --> 01:27:21,193
Where's Dad?

964
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:23,303
On a business trip.

965
01:27:23,973 --> 01:27:25,403
But his briefcase...

966
01:27:26,803 --> 01:27:29,773
Oh no, he must've forgotten it.

967
01:27:29,913 --> 01:27:31,603
And his scarf and train pass.

968
01:27:33,283 --> 01:27:34,373
What? Oh, no!

969
01:27:34,913 --> 01:27:37,883
He was supposed to leave early.

970
01:27:37,983 --> 01:27:39,423
Father!

971
01:27:40,893 --> 01:27:42,183
Dear!

973
01:27:49,793 --> 01:27:51,423
Mom must've overslept.

974
01:27:52,733 --> 01:27:56,723
She woke up late and thought Dad had already left.

975
01:27:56,873 --> 01:27:58,393
Oh, I see.

976
01:28:06,083 --> 01:28:08,313
B...b...briefcase!

977
01:28:08,753 --> 01:28:10,373
H...h...here!

978
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:12,013
I'm off!

979
01:28:12,283 --> 01:28:14,253
Have a nice trip!

980
01:28:18,223 --> 01:28:20,253
Be careful!

981
01:28:24,303 --> 01:28:25,763
I can still make it.

982
01:28:53,693 --> 01:28:55,253
Are you OK?

983
01:29:07,573 --> 01:29:08,733
Phone, phone...

984
01:29:19,723 --> 01:29:22,083
I suddenly feel terrible...

985
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:27,923
I can hardly breathe...

986
01:29:28,233 --> 01:29:31,223
Yes, yes, I'll get there.

987
01:29:32,003 --> 01:29:34,163
I'll crawl there if I have to...

988
01:29:34,633 --> 01:29:36,333
Please tell the client...

989
01:29:36,533 --> 01:29:40,203
Yes, yes, I'm terribly sorry...

990
01:29:45,043 --> 01:29:46,603
A slight fever.

991
01:29:47,653 --> 01:29:48,943
You should stay home.

992
01:29:50,183 --> 01:29:52,213
Before it gets worse.

993
01:29:52,323 --> 01:29:55,113
The company won't take care o you.

994
01:29:57,193 --> 01:30:00,653
You know, maybe I will. Make a long weekend of it.

995
01:30:00,763 --> 01:30:02,953
You should, you should.

996
01:30:03,063 --> 01:30:06,593
It's good to relax and enjoy some time at home.

997
01:30:22,913 --> 01:30:24,783
...What is it?

998
01:30:27,123 --> 01:30:30,813
I started feeling better,
the minute I decided to stay home.

999
01:30:31,323 --> 01:30:33,883
I guess I'll go in after all.

1000
01:30:47,973 --> 01:30:49,633
Take care, dear.

1001
01:31:57,373 --> 01:32:00,873
Next, Mr. Yamada will offer his congratulations.

1002
01:32:01,453 --> 01:32:03,913
Your notes, dear.

1003
01:32:10,223 --> 01:32:12,383
He's wound tight as a spring!

1004
01:32:20,103 --> 01:32:25,333
Um... This is a fine, auspicious day...

1005
01:32:29,773 --> 01:32:33,273
Cucumber, garbage bags, light bulbs

1006
01:32:46,663 --> 01:32:49,093
Life is full of surprises...

1007
01:32:54,973 --> 01:32:57,663
Now...that is, up until now...

1008
01:32:58,403 --> 01:33:01,203
things seemed to be just fine...

1009
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:05,703
then suddenly, you're shoved off a cliff!

1010
01:33:05,883 --> 01:33:08,903
By...your trusted spouse,

1011
01:33:09,213 --> 01:33:12,213
of all people!

1012
01:33:13,283 --> 01:33:14,723
He means you.

1013
01:33:16,593 --> 01:33:19,923
But Ichiro and Kazuko...

1014
01:33:20,293 --> 01:33:24,623
You have to accept life as it comes.

1015
01:33:27,263 --> 01:33:30,763
Acceptance is the key to surviving

1016
01:33:30,873 --> 01:33:36,503
the worst situations,
without losing heart or breaking up.

1017
01:33:36,913 --> 01:33:38,773
Breaking up?!

1018
01:33:40,843 --> 01:33:42,873
Even the worst behavior...

1019
01:33:43,413 --> 01:33:48,373
can be accepted and forgiven if there is no malice.

1020
01:33:48,493 --> 01:33:51,513
In fact, must be forgiven so one can go on with life!

1021
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:54,013
Gutsy speech!

1022
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:59,763
It's not necessarily bad
to resign yourself to a situation.

1023
01:33:59,963 --> 01:34:02,263
In fact, it's essential.

1024
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:05,363
A must for a happy family.

1025
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:08,673
A must for facing life and getting on with it.

1026
01:34:10,443 --> 01:34:14,143
Though it may sound negative,

1027
01:34:14,683 --> 01:34:17,773
'acceptance'

1028
01:34:17,983 --> 01:34:22,683
is the only way out of totally unacceptable situations.

1029
01:34:25,663 --> 01:34:30,093
I didn't know he had it in him... What a man.

1030
01:34:38,103 --> 01:34:41,763
Um, well, that is, I mean.

1031
01:34:45,843 --> 01:34:48,943
So, my dear Ichiro and Kazuko,

1032
01:34:49,283 --> 01:34:52,273
congratulations on your wedding.

1033
01:34:53,823 --> 01:34:59,783
May you be a tough, harmonious couple.

1034
01:35:10,503 --> 01:35:18,473
When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my sweetheart, what lies ahead?

1035
01:35:19,813 --> 01:35:26,583
Will we have rainbows day after day?
Here's what my sweetheart said

1036
01:35:27,383 --> 01:35:33,813
Que sera sera, whatever will be, will be

1037
01:35:34,863 --> 01:35:45,173
the future's not ours to see
qu ser ser, qu ser ser

1038
01:35:47,543 --> 01:35:51,003
A skinhead cut would disguise your baldness.

1039
01:35:52,383 --> 01:35:53,433
Who asked you!

1040
01:35:54,143 --> 01:35:56,443
Don't you need dentures, mother?

1041
01:35:56,553 --> 01:35:57,383
Who asked you!

1042
01:35:57,483 --> 01:35:59,713
Cut it out! Both of you!

1043
01:35:59,823 --> 01:36:03,253
You're starting to look like a sumo wrestler.

1044
01:36:03,353 --> 01:36:04,013
You tell her!

1045
01:36:04,123 --> 01:36:05,213
How dare you!

1046
01:36:07,723 --> 01:36:11,753
You're setting a terrible example!
In front of the children.

1047
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:14,633
I can't hear the TV!

1048
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:20,743
I know why we're so peaceful.

1049
01:36:22,113 --> 01:36:25,133
Because all three of you are nuts.

1050
01:36:25,413 --> 01:36:26,143
How dare you!

1051
01:36:26,383 --> 01:36:27,743
How dare you!

1052
01:36:28,613 --> 01:36:31,313
If even one of you were normal,

1053
01:36:31,983 --> 01:36:33,923
it'd throw off the balance.

1054
01:36:52,643 --> 01:36:54,663
What's your motto?

1055
01:36:54,773 --> 01:36:55,903
Getting married?

1056
01:36:56,013 --> 01:36:57,233
Change jobs?

1057
01:36:58,883 --> 01:37:00,503
Be quiet...

1058
01:37:07,053 --> 01:37:08,283
This.

1060
01:38:28,003 --> 01:38:30,593
Hey, everybody's in the picture!

1061
01:38:30,703 --> 01:38:31,963
Let's see.

1062
01:38:32,073 --> 01:38:33,333
Everyone's so tiny.

1063
01:38:33,443 --> 01:38:34,903
It's a stick-on picture.

1064
01:38:37,813 --> 01:38:39,903
Time to get some dinner...

1065
01:38:40,013 --> 01:38:41,073
Let's have pork cutlets.

1066
01:38:41,183 --> 01:38:42,153
I want pizza!

1067
01:38:42,253 --> 01:38:43,043
Tempura.

1068
01:38:43,153 --> 01:38:43,703
Spaghetti!

1069
01:38:43,913 --> 01:38:45,753
Quiet! I decide!
