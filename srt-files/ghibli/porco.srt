1
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,499
- Yeah?
- Porco Rosso!

2
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,969
The Mamma Aiutos are on the move!

3
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,799
The Mamma Aiutos?

4
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,299
I don't work cheap, you know.

5
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,069
They're after a boat out of Venice
carrying a mine payroll.

6
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,209
Is that all?

7
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,810
Uh, no...
There's a girls'-school tour aboard.

8
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,040
- That'll cost you.
- We'll pay Section 14-3 rates.

9
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,889
And 14-4, too.

10
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,319
Heave to!

11
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,029
Heave to or we sink you!

12
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,229
Wow! Pirates!

13
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:35,860
Not just 'pirates'! 'Air pirates'!

14
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:05,390
Time for an overhaul...

15
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,999
- Are you bad guys?
- Yep.

16
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,769
- So we're hostages?
- Yep.

17
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,639
- Are you air pirates?
- What a smart little girl!

18
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,199
- A skull!
- And very well-drawn!

19
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,840
- Come on! We're in a hurry!
- There's 15. Do we take them all?

20
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:57,570
It's not nice to break up the group!

21
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,769
Too late!

22
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,800
They took the girls and the money!
Bring them back for us!

23
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:25,970
They went that way!

24
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,749
No! They didn't go that way!

25
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,889
I know what those cheapskates
are up to.

26
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,129
They'll change course for the nearest
island as soon as they're out of sight.

27
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,190
They can't afford to waste gas.

28
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:53,000
Uh-oh...

29
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,700
Come on!

30
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:17,769
I don't have much time...

31
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:24,530
Gotcha!

32
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,849
Just a tour plane
going round the islands...

33
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,049
Hey, it's a pig! A pig!

34
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,459
Hey, piggy! He's so cute!
Look over here!

35
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,120
Hang around here and
the pirates'll get you!

36
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:58,300
Cool!

37
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,579
Will you all shut up!

38
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,479
We're flying!
Let me see!

39
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,220
Hey! Cut that out!
Quiet! Be quiet, will you?!

40
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,959
- Do something!
- You're the one who said

41
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,099
to bring them all!

42
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,259
Just for a second...

43
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,229
I'm not supposed
to let you do this...

44
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,099
It's so beautiful! Look!

45
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,969
- A red plane!
- Where? Where?

46
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:39,849
Did you see it?

47
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,649
That's as far as you go!

48
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,089
- Here it comes!
- It's Porco!

49
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:53,060
I can't see!

50
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,999
Oh, no!

51
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,199
It stopped!
We'll crash!

52
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,969
We've got another engine!

53
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,039
What are you doing?! Fire! Fire!

54
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:13,279
That red plane's tough!

55
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,750
You missed!

56
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,159
Move!
A message from the pig:

57
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:31,369
- 'You're beat. Do as I say.'
- Shut up!

58
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,739
He's coming! Get down!

59
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,109
Where did he go?!

60
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,040
He's hiding!

61
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:55,310
We crashed! We're going to sink!

62
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:03,360
No, we won't! This is a seaplane!

63
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,099
We're sinking!

64
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,940
Hey! Stop that!
Halt! You're hostages!

65
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,779
Don't worry.
We're all on the swim team.

66
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:19,640
- That's not what I mean!
- Another message!

67
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,690
'You can have half the money.
Give me the rest and the kids.'

68
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,759
'Or I'll kill all of you.'

69
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,989
Which means...

70
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,029
...half the money!
- Shut up! Come on, you swine!

71
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:40,520
It's you and me!

72
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,809
Take that!

73
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:51,400
It's busted!

74
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:02,059
Bye-bye!

75
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:09,520
Don't be such a sap!

76
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,769
Be quiet, will you?

77
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:21,639
Don't pull on that! You'll break it!

78
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,709
Stay away from the propeller!

79
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:30,889
You've got to pee? Just do it there.

80
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,749
So the Mamma Aiutos
can't come tonight...

81
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,420
And that filthy pig
bounty hunter is a hero!

82
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,629
But this young kid's
an American, isn't he?

83
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,529
The air pirates of the Adriatic
can't ask an American for help!

84
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,800
His grandmother was a quarter Italian.

85
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,909
Anyway, we've got to do something
about Porco!

86
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,239
But ten per cent is outrageous!

87
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,250
When we sing of the time of the cherries,

88
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:16,620
gay nightingales and mocking blackbirds will celebrate,

89
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,829
pretty girls will have folly in their heads,

90
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,269
Beautiful!
pretty girls will have folly in their heads,

91
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,569
pretty girls will have folly in their heads,

92
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:30,590
and lovers, sunshine in their hearts.

93
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:37,020
When we sing of the time of the cherries,

94
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:45,600
the mocking blackbird will sing better.

95
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,550
But it is very short, the time of cherries,

96
00:10:51,650 --> 00:11:02,980
where some go to gather earrings in a dream,

97
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:10,780
cherries of love in similar gowns

98
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:19,240
falling beneath the leaves like drops of blood.

99
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,640
But it is very short, the time of cherries,

100
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,670
coral pendants which one gathers in a dream.

101
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,719
He's here.

102
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,150
With his snout in the air,
as always!

103
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:53,230
I will always love the time of the cherries,

104
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:59,260
it's from those times that i hold my heart an open wound...

105
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,629
Mr Porco Rosso?
I'm from The Neptune.
it's from those times that I hold my heart an open wound...

106
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,499
Mr Porco Rosso?
I'm from The Neptune.

107
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,030
Well done, sir! I guess
we won't see the Mamma Aiutos...

108
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,279
...for a while.
I hear that bounties...

109
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,579
...might be a little bit
higher this year...

110
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,950
Hey, you! Put me down!

111
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:25,010
Listen quietly to the music.

112
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:33,400
She's quite a woman.
Even American pilots know

113
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,339
Madame Gina at the Hotel Adriano.

114
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,169
Air pirates and bounty hunters alike
leave their quarrels outside.

115
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,609
So that's the famous Curtiss
parked outside?

116
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,710
'The Rattlesnake'.
Bringer of fame and fortune.

117
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,189
You beat Italians two years running
for the Schneider Trophy.

118
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,719
It's not just fast.

119
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,789
It's good in a dogfight, too.

120
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,820
But I hear tell of a 'Porco Rosso'
who's pretty famous, too.

121
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:05,060
Be careful of joining with the pirates,
kid. They're poor, they're cheap,

122
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,999
and they're dirty.
They don't bathe.

123
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,069
That's true.

124
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,809
Who are you calling dirty, pig?!

125
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,479
Quite a distinguished gathering!

126
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,179
You boys must be planning something.

127
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,579
You're right!

128
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,519
Always glad to see you,
but no war games here, OK?

129
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,320
We know, Gina. We don't work
within 50 kilometers of here.

130
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,729
We're even polite to the pig!

131
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,129
That's my boys.

132
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:41,790
Be seeing you.

133
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,839
Tell me what happened!

134
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,300
Next time we're alone.

135
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,259
That American's funny.

136
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,259
He took one look and said,
'Marry me! '

137
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,200
So I told him:
'I've married three pilots.'

138
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,460
'One died in the war, one in the
Atlantic, and the third in Asia.'

139
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,109
They found him?

140
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:28,170
I got a call today.
They found his remains in Bengal.

141
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:40,559
It's been three years.
I've got no more tears left.

142
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,699
The good ones all get killed.
To comrades.

143
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:53,930
Thanks, Marco.
You're always here for me.

144
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,979
You're the only one left
from the old days.

145
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,419
One thing I don't like
about this place.

146
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,389
That picture.

147
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,089
Don't touch it.

148
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:13,050
It's the only one of you
when you were human.

149
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,420
The spell that changed you...
how can we break it?

150
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:47,750
That American jerk is a good pilot.

151
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:16,390
Must be nice to make that much money.

152
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,089
This month's payment.

153
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,729
That pays off the loan on your plane.

154
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,600
How about making a contribution
to the people with a Patriot Bond?

155
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:33,930
I'm not a 'person'.

156
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,959
Hello, Porco Rosso! It's done!

157
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,729
Give me 60 bullets.

158
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,559
It's pretty crowded outside.

159
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,329
Yeah? Maybe the government's
going to change again.

160
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,600
They'll pass a law against you guys.

161
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,239
Laws don't apply to pigs.

162
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,479
That's for sure... or moles like me.

163
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,810
Just regular bullets? Not high-
explosives, or armor-piercing?

164
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,119
Listen, kid, we're not fighting
a war out there.

165
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,989
See you.

166
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,489
Thank you!

167
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,299
Hey, Boss... how is war
different from bounty hunting?

168
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:35,130
War profiteers are villains.
Bounty hunters are just stupid.

169
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,769
We're air pirates!
We don't take out bank loans!

170
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,109
What else can we do?

171
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,009
These repairs were expensive!

172
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:51,740
Federation planes!

173
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,090
Why do we have to fly with
a bunch of losers like this?!

174
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,129
It's all the pig's fault!

175
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,829
Can't those Mamma Aiutos
even afford paint?

176
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:08,390
That is shabby!
It looks like everyone's here.

177
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,039
Hey, is the American here yet?

178
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,910
He's up in the sun!
Right where he should be!

179
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,949
'Sighted target:
The Mediterranean Queen. '

180
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,759
We're taking a ship that big?!

181
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,159
That's why we all got together!

182
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,169
'Having engine trouble. Go first.
We will cover you.'

183
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,169
'That's a dirty trick!
We follow the plan! '

184
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,669
'Then we share repair costs! '

185
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:49,130
'You gutless wonder! We pay
our own repairs, just like always! '

186
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:57,840
'Engine trouble! Engine trouble! '
'We settled all this before! '

187
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:05,059
All of you, shut up!

188
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:10,690
Attention all passengers: We are
under attack... by air pirates.

189
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,570
There is no need for alarm.
We carry two advanced fighter aircraft.

190
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,440
We will now introduce our pilots.

191
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:27,540
Number 1:
The Black Stallion, Signor Valleta!

192
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,810
Number 2: The Wolf of the Tiber,
Flying Officer Visconti!

193
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,359
They've got muscle!

194
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:51,230
That wasn't in the deal!

195
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,439
Aw, what a mess!

196
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,279
Get away from me! Curtiss!!

197
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:07,040
Right! Let's go!

198
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,539
That's not good.

199
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:31,510
Guess I have to go to Milan.

200
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:35,870
... both pilots were shot down,
but parachuted to safety.

201
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,550
The Pirate Federation looted
the vessel and left this message:

202
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,420
You're next!
Come and get us, pig!

203
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,590
We repeat...
'You're next. Come and get us, pig! '

204
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:01,609
Way to go, you turkeys!

205
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:06,009
Sorry. I'm on vacation.

206
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:12,820
White sheets, beautiful women...

207
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:25,620
Just get me to Milan, engine.

208
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:49,180
I don't like that weather.
I'll just have to go below the clouds.

209
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:50,949
Come on! You can do it!

210
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:58,510
That's right, engine! Good boy!

211
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:11,290
Pig!

212
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,339
It's one against one!

213
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:24,740
Not right now!

214
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,019
I'll tell everyone you ran and hid!

215
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,399
Catch you later, yank!

216
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,929
Oh, damn!

217
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,999
Uh-oh...

218
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,039
Gotcha!

219
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:52,010
No, you didn't! My engine quit!

220
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:02,720
Yes! Now I'll be famous, too! Yahoo!

221
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:25,710
I can't go back empty-handed, though.
They won't believe me without proof.

222
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,710
There!

223
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,640
That stupid red color... no mistake!

224
00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:02,640
A souvenir for my mama in Alabama!

225
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:48,210
Hurry, please.

226
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,060
Madame Gina!
There's a phone call.

227
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:57,190
He's safe. He's alive.

228
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:04,930
Use the phone at the front desk.

229
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,019
Marco? Are you all right?
I was just leaving to look for you.

230
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,419
Oh? Good!

231
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,119
I've lost weight.

232
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,529
Two nights on a deserted island.

233
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,129
I'm taking the plane to Milan
to get it fixed.

234
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,829
If that American comes
in...

235
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,299
... tell him I'll be seeing him again.

236
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,539
Hey! I'm not a messenger!

237
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:39,000
I worry about you, and you treat me like
part of the furniture!

238
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:46,520
Someday you're going to be a pork roast.
I don't want to go to your funeral.

239
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,789
A pig's gotta fly.

240
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:56,850
Idiot!

241
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,139
I figured you'd be in tonight.

242
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,569
- I'm back.
- Messed it up again, huh?

243
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:57,770
- Why not just get a new plane?
- No, I like this one.

244
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,209
I know how you feel.

245
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:07,049
Look out... I'll back her in.

246
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,759
Who's the little cutie?

247
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,489
My grand-daughter, back from the States.

248
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:22,760
Keep coming... keep coming...

249
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,989
What a beautiful plane, Grandpa!

250
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,089
It's got great lines!

251
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,150
There's no one now
who can do work like that.

252
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,659
No resemblance.

253
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,890
- She's really your grand-daughter?
- Hands off.

254
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:59,439
- Fio, lock up.
- OK.

255
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,009
My opponent is Curtiss.
I need another 15 knots.

256
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:07,470
Curtiss? I haven't heard
that name for a while.

257
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,549
- Well?
- Where did you get a Folgore?

258
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,759
Don't ask.

259
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,989
The Italian that Curtiss beat in 1927

260
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,229
for the Schneider Trophy
had this engine.

261
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:27,899
But it wasn't the engine's fault.
The mechanic was a fool.

262
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,599
This is exciting!

263
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,130
Don't fine-tune it too much.
It's not a race.

264
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:38,510
Tell me about it!
You're explaining Buddhism to Buddha.

265
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,219
Are you going to take all I have?

266
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:51,560
These days money's not worth the paper
it's printed on. Empty your pockets...

267
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,859
that's for the propeller, the paint...

268
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,629
That's for my hotel and my meals!

269
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:03,360
Stay here.
I'll give you room and board cheap.

270
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,430
- Where are your sons? Are they good?
- They're all away working.

271
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,849
- So who'll do the design?
- Fio.

272
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,849
Fio? That little girl?

273
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:20,180
She's young, but she's got
something my sons don't.

274
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:29,820
We've been together a long time,
but I think I'll try somewhere else.

275
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:37,230
Wait!

276
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,339
Are you worried because I'm a girl?
Or because I'm young?

277
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,300
- Both, Miss.
- I can understand that.

278
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:51,819
Tell me... what's the main thing
that goes to make a good pilot?

279
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,119
- Experience?
- No. Inspiration.

280
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,020
I'm glad you didn't say experience.
Grandpa says you were very young

281
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:06,050
when you first soloed...
and that you were good even then.

282
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:10,570
It was in 1910... when I was 17.

283
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,539
17?! I'm 17 now!

284
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:19,070
Let me try. I can't help being a
girl, but we've got the old drawings.

285
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,079
If it's no good,
you don't have to pay.

286
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,149
OK, Grandpa?

287
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:29,610
She's kin. She'll do fine. I took
apart my first engine when I was 12.

288
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:35,030
Sleep on this. We'll fix you a bed
tomorrow. Breakfast's at 7.

289
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:39,429
Good night.

290
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:44,500
You're still short, but we're
old friends. Pay the rest later.

291
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:33,319
- Good morning. Did you sleep well?
- Did you work all night?

292
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,419
This is just rough.

293
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:40,090
We'll leave this part as it is,
but use a different wing section.

294
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,259
That should give us five knots.

295
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:48,330
The old drawings were a surprise.
The wings were single-structure.

296
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:54,140
The old drawings were a surprise.
Whoever did this really understood wood.

297
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,840
- I'm impressed.
- They only made one of these.

298
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,850
It was too dangerous to fly.
I found it in a warehouse.

299
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,289
I thought so.
The way the wings are set,

300
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:13,690
- I'm surprised it even takes off.
- Landings and take-offs are tricky.

301
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:21,460
They're better at high speed. Tilt the
wings back half a degree for me.

302
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,599
Leave the rest the same.

303
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,439
So you'll let me do it?
Thank you! You won't be sorry.

304
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:34,610
But there's one condition, Miss.
Don't work all night.

305
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,350
You don't do good work on no sleep.
It's bad for your looks, too.

306
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,089
All right.

307
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:47,750
Actually, I was so nervous last night
I couldn't sleep.

308
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,229
To tell you the truth, I was afraid you
wouldn't let me do it.

309
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:55,999
I'm so happy! I'll make some coffee.

310
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I sure hope she's not going
to build it alone, too...

311
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:13,880
My niece Monica will do the drawings,
my great-nephew's wife the finishing...

312
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:17,889
My cousin's daughters...
Sophia, Laura, Constance and Valentina.

313
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:22,160
Fio's sister Giliola.
Sandra's her cousin.

314
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,099
Marietta, you've gotten so pretty!

315
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,030
My sons' wives Maria, Tina, Anna,
and her sister Miletta.

316
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,869
Porcelino!

317
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:36,970
Grandma!
The angels haven't come for you yet?

318
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,819
You've grown up into a fine man!

319
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,249
You all work here, too?

320
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,380
To buy things
for our great-grandchildren!

321
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:58,399
There's not one man here!

322
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,990
- They're all family?
- Yeah. There's no work here.

323
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:07,170
The men are all gone away.

324
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,839
The depression...

325
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,540
Don't worry. The women are
tough and they work hard.

326
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:23,280
It's not pancakes we're making here...

327
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,359
Our Lord who art in Heaven...

328
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,760
We thank thee for giving our
struggling company work and bread.

329
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:37,790
Forgive my sin of using women's hands
to build a warplane.

330
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:46,040
Let's eat up and get to work!

331
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:03,320
That sounds good!
This engine was a good choice.

332
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,529
How do you like them RPMs?

333
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:12,600
Watch out or you'll blow
the shed away!

334
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:20,510
Curtiss doesn't stand a chance.

335
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,569
Yeah, it's a good idea...

336
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,979
So can I do it?

337
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,470
Well... this is going to cost
a lot more money.

338
00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:01,380
Look how far we are over budget
already... and our customer...

339
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,929
Porco...

340
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:11,020
Don't look at me like that!
Do whatever you like.

341
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,470
Great! I'll tell the workshop
and we'll get to work!

342
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:21,369
Porco, I love you!

343
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,679
I can wait three months.

344
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,440
- Maybe I'll become a pirate.
- She's a good kid, huh?

345
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,479
Hands off.

346
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:38,880
That's the furthest thing from my mind.

347
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,620
- So you're a Squadron Leader now?
- What did you come back for?

348
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:58,500
- I go where I want, Ferrarin.
- The authorities won't like it.

349
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,709
- Are you being tailed?
- Yeah.

350
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,870
There are warrants out on you for
treason, illegal entry...

351
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:10,910
...decadence, pornography
and being a lazy pig.

352
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:18,560
It's not funny!
They want to seize your plane, too.

353
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:24,320
- This is a lousy film.
- Come back to the Air Force, Marco.

354
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,530
- I could still get you in.
- Better a pig than a Fascist.

355
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,139
Freelance daredevils are finished.

356
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:37,870
To fly now you need a government
or an airline to pay you.

357
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,470
I only fly on what I earn myself.

358
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,989
Wherever you fly, you're still a pig.

359
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:50,889
Thanks, Ferrarin. Say hello to the guys.

360
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,959
This is a good film.

361
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,599
Be careful. They won't bother
with a court of law.

362
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:06,120
See you, buddy.

363
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:24,980
Want a ride?

364
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:31,780
Thanks a lot.

365
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:38,270
I borrowed this to take the plane
to the lake for tests tomorrow.

366
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,039
No time for that. I've got to fly.

367
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,670
Don't be stupid! I'm not
delivering an untested plane!

368
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,549
We can take it apart and get it
to the lake in a day!

369
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:54,990
There's no time. Take a careful
look out the back window.

370
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,850
The Fascist Secret Police.
They followed you.

371
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:06,530
- Me? Why?
- 'Cause they're following me.

372
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:12,839
And you're fixing my plane.

373
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:20,009
Hey, are you really a spy?

374
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:27,150
Me a spy?!
Spies are a lot more serious than me.

375
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:33,060
But you were a war hero.
Why follow you if you've done nothing?

376
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:39,999
I agree!

377
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,590
Whoops! Wrong way.

378
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,979
I guess you did do something.

379
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:05,250
Time to get busy.

380
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:32,049
- It's ready to fly.
- There's two men out back and three

381
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:38,220
- out front... this is so exciting!
- Settle down, Grandma!

382
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:48,990
I'll see you.

383
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,579
What are you doing?

384
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:00,640
Making myself a place.
Give me five seconds.

385
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,879
What are you talking about?!
Don't be stupid!

386
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,320
- Shh! Don't shout!
- Listen, Fio...

387
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,120
...you're a respectable woman.
Plus you're not married!

388
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,959
Hold this.

389
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:26,160
Thanks. I had to rush to make this...

390
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:31,209
A perfect fit!
Hold that, will you?

391
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:37,740
Look, I'm a bounty hunter.
I don't run tourist flights!

392
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:44,850
I want to get my first job right.
I can make adjustments as we go.

393
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:50,860
I'm taking off from the canal.
I might not even get airborne!

394
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:56,490
All the more reason to take me.
You'll need a mechanic against Curtiss.

395
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:01,530
I'm a male, and we'll be all
alone on a deserted island.

396
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,979
Great! I love camping out.

397
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,249
That's not the point!

398
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:11,580
Take her along! If you don't
beat Curtiss, we don't get paid.

399
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,849
If you don't pay, we go broke.

400
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,059
You're her grandfather!

401
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,080
I'll give you a break on her salary,
and I'll throw in this voice tube.

402
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:27,730
- There'll be a price on her head, too.
- No. I'll be your hostage.

403
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,830
We'll tell the police you forced us
to help you. That'll be our excuse.

404
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:37,970
So please, take me with you.
I'll make myself useful.

405
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,949
Take out the right machine gun.

406
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:48,390
I don't care how small your bottom is,
it won't fit between them.

407
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:51,789
Oh, great!
My hips are bigger than they look.

408
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,629
Wait a second.

409
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:58,599
We'll leave now, before Grandma
wants to come, too.

410
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,469
Hey, that's an idea!

411
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:04,939
Grandma, quick!

412
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:13,340
Please don't buy me anything!

413
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:24,040
Contact!

414
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:34,460
Open up!

415
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:43,670
Let go!

416
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:07,420
Kidnapper! Pay us our money!

417
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,000
- How's the rudder, Porco?
- Very rough! Like you!

418
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:19,949
Harder to handle than ever!

419
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,279
Stop and I'll fix it.

420
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:29,049
No time! I've got to get her up!

421
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,819
This water's like glue!

422
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,829
Ship ahoy!

423
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:41,629
Here we go!

424
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,339
Come on, baby!

425
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,999
The flaps are in the water!
Use your tabs!

426
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,679
- Tabs?
- They're new!

427
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,660
Quick!

428
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:12,220
That's right! Now you're behaving!

429
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:49,029
Beautiful. The world is so beautiful.

430
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:53,569
Are they after us?
He's not attacking...

431
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:58,840
...but that's an Air Force plane.
Ferrarin, I bet...

432
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,549
You know him?
The Air Force is waiting for us.

433
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:15,320
He'll show us a way through.

434
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:32,779
He says to go low and out to sea.

435
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:37,040
- Thanks, buddy!
- Thank you!

436
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:52,920
Seeing you, he's probably thinking
'pearls before swine.'

437
00:49:54,590 --> 00:50:01,970
Beautiful! A single rose
blooming in a secret garden.

438
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,769
Very rude. This is a private garden.

439
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:15,640
I just had to see you...

440
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,119
From Hollywood?

441
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,689
'In the matter of your starring
in the script you have sent... '

442
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:26,529
'Serious consideration'
and 'please reply ASAP.'

443
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:30,299
I call it Flower of the Adriatic.

444
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,299
Nice name.

445
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:36,130
You like it? Then it's settled.
Gina, come to Hollywood with me.

446
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:43,110
Being a hired gun for air pirates
is a mere step to fame and fortune.

447
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,979
The next step is Hollywood star.

448
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,749
And then?

449
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:53,970
President!

450
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:04,390
I'm serious! I'll make you
the First Lady, Gina! I mean it! Gina!

451
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:09,700
- You're stupid. I like that in a man.
- Really?!

452
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:16,269
But I can't. I'm gambling right now...

453
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:23,080
...that someone will visit me here,
and I'll tell him I love him.

454
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,589
But the fool only comes
to the club, at night.

455
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:35,820
He never comes out in daylight.

456
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:19,730
That jerk's come back!

457
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:21,320
Idiot!

458
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,709
He just kept on going. I lost my bet.

459
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,679
You mean you're betting on that jerk?

460
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,209
Can't I?

461
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:38,979
Life here is more complicated
than where you're from.

462
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:45,360
You can fall in love again and again,
but... You go to Hollywood, kid.

463
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:51,399
'Kid'?!

464
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,099
I bumped my head when you did that roll!

465
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,229
Just saying hello to a friend.

466
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:00,599
Gina of the Hotel Adriano?

467
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,569
The woman in white on the terrace?

468
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:07,309
Grandpa told me.
All the pilots in the Adriatic

469
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,879
are in love with her.

470
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,179
He's got a big mouth!

471
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:15,689
What's she like?
Are you in love with her, too?

472
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:19,189
I'm putting down.
Shut up or you'll bite your tongue.

473
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:25,450
Hey, wait!

474
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,949
A girl riding a fighter plane!

475
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:53,659
- Where's Porco?
- Talking to my dad about something.

476
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:58,090
It's not just the caretaker government.
It's the royalists, too.

477
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,199
They want to link up
with the Pirates' Federation.

478
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,969
There's no money in
chasing pirates any more.

479
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,939
- There.
- Thanks.

480
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,939
All this talk about a depression!

481
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,979
You ought to sell your services
somewhere, too.

482
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,919
A good pilot can make good money.

483
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,380
- Got any smokes?
- Curtiss'll go back to the States soon.

484
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:27,389
We're the ones who should
go to America.

485
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:31,559
'Farewell to the days of
fun and freedom in the Adriatic.'

486
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:39,399
- Is that Byron?
- No, me. See you.

487
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,739
Porco, it's terrible!

488
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:46,709
Their fuel's three times
what it is back in Italy!

489
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,809
Give us a break!

490
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:53,270
We don't water our fuel here!
Man, girls are stupid!

491
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:57,840
- Talk to her, will you?
- Pay him, Fio.

492
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,190
Then stuff that bigger-than-it-Iooks
backside in with the machine gun.

493
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:07,420
- Off to the hideout!
- I'm putting the fuel on your bill!

494
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,739
They're fair.
We help each other when we need it.

495
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:22,110
It's pretty around here,
but no one's got much money.

496
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:31,480
There's the island.

497
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:54,130
It's beautiful!

498
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,529
What a great hideout!

499
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:17,050
Agh! My leg's gone to sleep.

500
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:33,940
- Look at all you silly idiots...
- Hey, Boss! We got him!

501
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:38,289
Watch who you're stepping on!
Move!

502
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:42,820
We've been waiting, pig.
We knew you were coming.

503
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:45,729
We've got a score to settle.

504
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:48,969
He's got a girl with him!

505
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:49,969
She's pretty!

506
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:52,669
Shut up! So what?

507
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:57,570
- Half the world is women!
- That's not just any girl!

508
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,239
She's Piccolo's chief design engineer.

509
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:04,880
- A cute little thing like her?
- Are you sure?

510
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:08,749
My plane's a lot better than it was.

511
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:11,819
She's young but she's good.

512
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,489
Really, Porco?

513
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:20,400
I never lie about planes.
She's here to make sure I pay the bill.

514
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,769
You're in debt, too?

515
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:28,140
Serves you right!
Bust that plane up so bad

516
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,839
all he's got left is the loan on it!

517
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:38,940
You're going to take an axe to the plane
I built?! A plane as beautiful as that?!

518
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:42,019
It's a long story, Miss.

519
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,219
So you are!

520
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:47,850
Well, you know...
And you call yourselves pilots?!

521
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:56,550
Move! Where are my shoes?

522
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:02,800
I was raised on stories
about seaplane pilots.

523
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:08,940
My grandpa always said
there's no finer people.

524
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:13,420
Their hearts are washed clean
by both sea and sky.

525
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,989
So they're braver than sailors...

526
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:21,989
...and prouder than regular pilots.

527
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:25,759
That's right. That's a seaplane pilot!

528
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:31,460
The most precious thing to
them isn't money or women, it's honor.

529
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:36,060
- Yeah! That's right, Miss!
- Hurray for seaplane pilots!

530
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:40,239
Oh, brother!

531
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,480
All right. We won't take our axes
and bust up the plane you built.

532
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:49,749
But honor won't let us just walk away,
either!

533
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,019
Mince the pig!

534
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:55,129
Yeah! Make hamburger out of him!

535
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,129
Don't be so pig-headed!

536
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:01,460
You don't understand!
Haven't you any shame?!

537
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:04,569
You need an American to come
and save you?

538
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:08,700
Your mothers would weep!
And tell you to take a bath!

539
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:13,570
Porco's come back to go
one-on-one with Curtiss...

540
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,179
...for the honor of the seaplane
pilots of the Adriatic!

541
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:21,310
A man without honor or scruples
is nothing! Fight fair!

542
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:25,989
I always said
we shouldn't hire Curtiss.

543
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:29,089
Stop trying to weasel out of things!

544
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:32,629
- What do we do, Boss?
- She makes sense.

545
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:35,329
We could lose face here.

546
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:40,400
- Should we talk to Curtiss again?
- Get him to fight again?

547
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:45,770
- The contract's expired...
- This is embarrassing!

548
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:54,019
It's Curtiss!

549
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:55,789
I heard you!

550
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:59,589
I don't run, and I don't hide!

551
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:08,120
What idiot put a path up there?!

552
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:20,639
Hold this for me.

553
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,049
So you want a return match?

554
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:28,990
But I already won once.
I'm no one's hired gun any more.

555
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:36,820
So what do you want?

556
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,899
Beautiful!

557
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:51,209
Will you marry me if I win?

558
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:52,809
I'm serious.

559
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:57,370
All right. But if Porco wins,
you pay his bills.

560
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:05,259
- Wait, Fio!
- You keep out of it!

561
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:09,590
- Speak now or hold your peace, Miss.
- It's up to him.

562
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:13,229
- This is expensive!
- It's cheap!

563
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,569
Yes or no?

564
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:18,239
I'll gladly fight for the woman I love!

565
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,939
Right! Listen, all of you!

566
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:24,709
I like this girl's spunk!

567
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:29,370
The Mamma Aiutos
will promote this fight!

568
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:36,319
Along with the Pirates' Federation!

569
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:41,659
See you later, Miss Fio!

570
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:43,929
You morons!

571
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,729
Don't forget to show up, pig!

572
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:49,729
Shut up and get out of here!

573
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:55,169
See ya!

574
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:59,800
Look what you've gone
and gotten me into!

575
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,470
Don't be angry. I know it was stupid.

576
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:15,720
Fio... I've got to thank you, anyway.

577
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:18,659
You got me a chance.

578
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:22,629
Thanks.
I guess fate meant for us to be a team.

579
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:26,639
So we're partners?

580
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,660
- My chances are only 50-50.
- I believe in you.

581
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:38,380
'Believe'... I hate that word, but
it sounds different coming from you.

582
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:48,320
What's the matter?
You're not feeling well?

583
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:50,659
I'm fine.

584
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:57,090
My heart started beating so fast I
couldn't breathe... I was really scared.

585
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:02,939
My knees are all wobbly...

586
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,179
Hey!

587
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:11,970
I'm going swimming!

588
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,899
Porco, we screwed up!

589
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:33,560
- How?
- We should have padded the bill!

590
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:40,940
- We blew it!
- You're right!

591
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:38,730
- Porco...
- What? Can't you sleep?

592
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:44,740
I could've sworn...
Or was I dreaming?

593
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:50,410
Go back to sleep.
Tomorrow's an early day.

594
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,780
Porco... why did you turn into a pig?

595
01:05:54,850 --> 01:06:01,050
- Well, you know...
- My father was in the same unit

596
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:05,650
as a Flight-Lieutenant Marco Paggot.
I used to love the story of how

597
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:11,220
he jumped off a cliff in a storm...
to rescue an enemy pilot.

598
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:19,379
Porco... shall I kiss you?

599
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:24,580
You know how the princess turned the
frog back into a prince...

600
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:28,710
Don't be stupid.
Save your kisses for when you need them.

601
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,719
Maybe I'm not the one.

602
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,499
You're a good girl.
You make me think

603
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:44,260
that all humanity's not a waste.
Now be a good girl and go to sleep.

604
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:48,739
Tell me a story, and I will.

605
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:56,010
A story? Let me see...

606
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:06,120
It was the last summer of the war.

607
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:12,290
We were on our usual patrol
over the Adriatic, heading for Istria.

608
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:21,069
Berlini was beside me.

609
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:25,530
An old friend,
who'd gotten married two days before.

610
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:30,209
I was best man at his wedding.

611
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:34,950
But we couldn't get leave,
so we'd come straight back to base.

612
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,709
Planes were going down like flies,
ours and theirs.

613
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:04,650
I had three on my tail.
I didn't have time for anyone else.

614
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:07,449
Then mine was the only one
of our planes left.

615
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:12,910
The enemy kept coming.
They had blood in their eyes.

616
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:18,480
My hands and feet were numb,
I couldn't see... I thought I was dead.

617
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,060
Suddenly everything all went
white in front of me.

618
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:28,700
White?
Yeah, like I was in pure light.

619
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:34,140
But a light so strange it took a
while to realize I was in cloud...

620
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:38,670
I was so tired I didn't have
enough strength to fly.

621
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:46,950
But the plane just kept flying
by itself.

622
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,849
A cloud prairie?

623
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:13,719
Yeah, and dead quiet.

624
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:19,780
The sky was so beautiful...
With that weird line of clouds

625
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:24,020
stretching up out of sight.

626
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:54,819
Berlini! You're OK?!

627
01:09:54,820 --> 01:10:03,520
Berlini! Wait! Where are you going?!

628
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:14,079
Berlini! Stop! What about Gina?!

629
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:21,070
I'll go instead!

630
01:10:56,090 --> 01:11:02,180
When I came to, I was flying all alone
right down on the water.

631
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,899
God was telling you 'not yet'.

632
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:13,840
I felt like he was telling me just to
keep on flying alone forever.

633
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,039
No, Porco! You're good!

634
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,939
The good ones are the dead ones.

635
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:26,610
It might have been hell I saw.
End of story. Go to sleep.

636
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:33,519
That junkyard sold me rusty bullets!

637
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:38,590
I'm glad you came back alive.
I like you.

638
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:46,460
Good night!

639
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,289
Place your bets here!

640
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:12,520
If you're real men,
put your money where your mouths are!

641
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,939
You'd think it was a carnival!

642
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:30,140
- They're all air pirates?
- The scum of the Mediterranean.

643
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:34,219
Gangsters, pirates, smugglers
...spies, plain-clothes cops,

644
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:37,989
a few respectable citizens...

645
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:41,389
This is going to make me
even more famous!

646
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:45,229
Ten minutes to start!

647
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:50,500
The showdown between Porco Rosso
and Donald Curtiss is about to begin!

648
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:57,000
There's no rules. The first one to run
is a coward forever!

649
01:12:57,410 --> 01:13:04,649
Shut up! We came here for
a dogfight, not speeches!

650
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:13,480
Shut up! Open your mouth
and we shoot you!

651
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:20,359
A ten-ton bomb would be better.

652
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:24,820
This fight decides the fate of our
beloved Miss Fio Piccolo...

653
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,939
...who needs no introduction!

654
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:31,770
Know what I mean?
A big hand for Fio! Applaud!

655
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,039
Let's get this over with!

656
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:39,279
Quiet! There are formalities to observe!

657
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:47,180
Both sides will place their wagers!

658
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,129
- Miss...
- Thank you.

659
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:54,699
Put it down!

660
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,960
No complaints? All right,
shake hands and come out flying!

661
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:03,700
Forget it. Pigs are clean animals.

662
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:09,910
- That's not very friendly.
- We'll go straight to the church!

663
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:15,110
Don't worry. My mother says
you can get used to anything.

664
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,729
- May we have a picture?
- We all took a bath!

665
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:32,290
- Smile, everyone!
- Smile!

666
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:52,489
Black wins if it's over
in three minutes!

667
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:58,999
Maybe we could get them
to do this every month!

668
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:05,369
Fifteen seconds to start.

669
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:08,669
That is so cool!

670
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,939
Five seconds...
Four...

671
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,639
Three...
Two...

672
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:19,540
One...
Zero!

673
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:29,580
Curtiss has the height!

674
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,669
It's all Curtiss so far!

675
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:50,730
Gimme!

676
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,919
Come on, Porco! Get above him!

677
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:59,650
He's a better target up high.
He's harder to hit on the deck.

678
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:13,890
Don't worry!
I've got lots of bullets!

679
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,089
- A barrel roll! The pig's on his tail!
- A barrel roll?!

680
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:37,359
That trick made him
'the Ace of the Adriatic'!

681
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:43,450
Curses!

682
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:50,039
Now!

683
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:53,579
- He didn't shoot!
- Are his guns jammed?

684
01:16:53,580 --> 01:17:00,380
He's not going to shoot until the very
last. The pig's not a killer.

685
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:04,480
The American's still got plenty of ammo!
Now! Shoot!

686
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:08,659
He didn't! What did I tell you?

687
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:11,289
If he shoots now,
he'll hit the American.

688
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:15,990
He's going to wait till he can put two
or three shots into the engine.

689
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:19,369
The damn fool thinks this isn't war!

690
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:21,369
Porco!

691
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:25,539
What's wrong with you?! Shoot!

692
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:29,740
Or are your guns jammed? Too bad!

693
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:39,459
They're coming this way!

694
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:47,199
Come on! Fight like a pig!

695
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,699
Not this way! No!

696
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:57,000
He ditched the pig!

697
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:10,619
Go fight somewhere else!

698
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:18,560
Look at those vapor trails!

699
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:23,660
This you only see
once in a lifetime!

700
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:30,220
This is so moving!

701
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:38,349
If she doesn't hurry, she'll miss it!

702
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:43,180
- She won't come out of her room.
- Are we going or not?

703
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:49,880
I want to see it!

704
01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:59,169
'F to Gina of my heart: Warn pig... '

705
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:02,469
'... to stop fooling around.
The Air Force is coming.'

706
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:08,740
'F'? That's Ferrarin...
Time to go!

707
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:33,630
- They're both really tough!
- They're just getting warmed up!

708
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:41,939
Go, Porco!

709
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:47,930
You stupid pig!

710
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:57,120
You think you're going to have Fio?!

711
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:59,929
Now the pig's got his tail!

712
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:05,269
The finale!

713
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:08,439
Huh?

714
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:13,439
It's jammed!

715
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:17,949
The finish!

716
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:22,619
What the...?!
Jammed!

717
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:29,620
What's the matter? Out of ammo?
It's bent! Fio's big butt!

718
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:38,430
- There aren't any ties in this game!
- This isn't a cowboy film!

719
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:42,709
What are you going to hit with that?

720
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:46,209
You jerk!

721
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:55,010
What good's that going to do?
Hi-ho, Silver!

722
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:02,429
You rotten pig!

723
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:05,359
Missed me!

724
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,729
- Chicken!
- You ducked!

725
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:11,229
- This is for love?
- Shut up, pig!

726
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:19,400
- Something's wrong.
- They're coming down!

727
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:28,080
- They're back!
- Wait! The prizes stay here!

728
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:36,180
Stay back! Stay back!

729
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,529
You eat too much!

730
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:47,590
Cowboy!

731
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,069
Put 'em up!

732
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:56,840
Go punch a cow!

733
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:02,689
Come on, Porco!

734
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:08,459
Get up, pig!

735
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:14,980
That's dirty!

736
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:39,150
- Uppercut! Block!
- Yes! Yes!

737
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,119
Yes! The Federation can set up
as bookmakers!

738
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:49,599
Bring a bell!

739
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,999
Can't you go faster?

740
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,069
No. The engine'll burn up.

741
01:22:54,070 --> 01:23:01,900
Pilots are all crazy!

742
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:10,049
Fio! Did you see that punch?

743
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:13,119
I'll finish you in the next round!

744
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:17,620
- Next round you go to sleep!
- Stay in there!

745
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:22,199
You're going to be brain-dead!

746
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,669
Come on, pretty-boy!

747
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:31,660
You're the pretty-boy here!
Chasing every girl you see!

748
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:35,309
What about you?!
Who's it going to be, Fio or Gina?

749
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:40,019
What?

750
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:43,949
Stop hogging them!

751
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:47,459
Gina...

752
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:51,729
'Miss Gina' to you!

753
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:59,539
Gina's in love with you!

754
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:04,739
She sits in that garden...

755
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:08,209
...and waits...

756
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:16,700
...for you to come!

757
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:20,559
- Porco!
- The bell!

758
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:29,460
Start the count!
Look at him!

759
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:37,560
The Air Force isn't here yet.

760
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:51,049
Try to psyche me out, will you?

761
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:53,759
I don't get you!

762
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:59,029
It's the truth!

763
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:02,159
You won't get Fio!

764
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:06,469
That's Gina!

765
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:13,630
There's trouble!

766
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,949
First one to stand wins!

767
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:30,089
Coming through!

768
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:35,629
No, Gina!

769
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:40,769
Marco! Can you hear me?

770
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:48,930
Are you going to make
another woman unhappy?

771
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:57,119
Porco!

772
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,189
Porco!

773
01:25:58,190 --> 01:26:00,359
Thank you, Porco!

774
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:07,850
It was nothing.

775
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,429
OK, the party's over.

776
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:16,270
The Italian Air Force is coming.
Get out of here, everyone.

777
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:20,500
Come to the club.
Drinks are on the house!

778
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:25,510
We're out of here!

779
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:38,729
It's over.

780
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:42,029
Boss! Hurry!

781
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:46,139
There are formalities to observe!

782
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:51,070
I hate the pig, but I like you.
Build some good planes. 'Bye!

783
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:55,879
Thanks. Take a bath sometime!

784
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:58,309
Thanks, Mr Curtiss!

785
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:02,179
Next time it won't be a bet.
I'll court you for real.

786
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:05,449
Sure. But I've made up my mind.

787
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:08,819
- You ride in Gina's plane.
- No!

788
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:13,420
I ride in your plane!
We're partners, aren't we?

789
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:19,300
Gina, take this girl
back to the regular world.

790
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:26,109
You always do this. It's not fair.

791
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:33,740
Sorry. Away you go.

792
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:40,310
Take her up.

793
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:09,419
Here comes the Air Force.

794
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:16,420
- Help me lead them away.
- Hey! Your face! Wait!

795
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:19,929
- Show me your face!
- Your plane's over there!

796
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:26,450
Just one look!

797
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:33,509
Porco never showed up again, even
after the Air Force did its sweep...

798
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:41,040
... and I went back to Milan.

799
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:47,450
But Gina and I became good friends...

800
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:54,990
... and we still are, through all the
war and turmoil there's been since then.

801
01:28:57,370 --> 01:29:04,300
Now I run Piccolo Co., but I
still summer at the Hotel Adriano.

802
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:10,800
Gina is more beautiful every year,
and there are lots of old faces.

803
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:19,620
Oh, yes... 'Mr Curtiss' still isn't
President, but he writes us...

804
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:25,259
... saying he misses the good old days
of that Adriatic summer.

805
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:30,100
Whether Gina ever won her bet or not
is our secret.

806
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:54,020
Now, shall we talk about the old times?

807
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:59,600
The friends we often met at the store

808
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:07,170
Along the road, rows of chestnut trees could be seen from the window

809
01:30:07,190 --> 01:30:12,640
One cup of coffee, all day long

810
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:20,000
Recklessly searching for an unknown tomorrow

811
01:30:20,150 --> 01:30:25,440
Everybody had hopes

812
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:33,110
The times we were shaken and blown by the hot wind

813
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:41,390
We felt it with our entire being... That's how it was.

814
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:59,840
Sometimes we all slept by the side of the road

815
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:05,070
None of us could go anywhere

816
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:12,940
We had no money, but somehow we lived

817
01:31:13,150 --> 01:31:18,090
Poorness carried tomorrow to us

818
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:26,030
We barged into a small boarding house

819
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:31,730
were rowdy until morning, and then slept

820
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:39,530
Every day burned like a tempest

821
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:48,040
I ran until I felt like dying... That's how it was.

822
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:19,500
Look at the one remaining photograph...

823
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:24,500
You're the bearded man, aren't you

824
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:32,660
Nowadays, there are many friends

825
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,670
whom I have lost track of

826
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:45,470
But I can't say to anyone

827
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:50,900
That those days were completely in vain

828
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:59,060
Even now you trace the same unfulfilled dream

829
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:08,290
You're still running... somewhere...
