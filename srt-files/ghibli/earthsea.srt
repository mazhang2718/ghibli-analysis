2
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:18,068
Only in silence the word,
only in dark the light,

3
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,401
only in dying life:

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:25,067
bright the hawk's flight!
on the empty sky.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,363
- The Creation of Éa

6
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,598
Ease the Sail!

7
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,390
It's blowing too hard!

8
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:58,476
Curse it! A storm this time of year?
Where's my Weatherworker?

9
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:04,107
What are you waiting for?
Calm the waves before we sink!

10
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,151
What's wrong?

11
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,280
Captain... I can't remember them.

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,534
I can't remember the True Names
of wind and waves.

13
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,337
What? Are you mad?

14
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,750
Captain!

15
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,044
There's something above the clouds!

16
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:25,920
Where?

17
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,468
What is that?

18
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,325
A dragon!
What is it doing here?

19
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,168
There's another one!

20
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,037
Dragons fighting? That's impossible!

21
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:04,064
More than 2,000 sheep
have taken the fever in Enlad alone.

22
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,070
Half of them have died.

23
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,777
Seven hundred cattle
have been infected.

24
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,071
We've lost 50 head so far.

25
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:17,908
In fact, a baby on Taon
has also come down with the fever.

26
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,501
Silence!

27
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,082
If we panic,
what will become of the People?

28
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,299
Seal off the affected areas.

29
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,592
Send every healer
in the kingdom to find a cure.

30
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,008
Send provisions
to those who need them.

31
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,762
Wizard Root!
Find out what's behind this.

32
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,597
Your Majesty.

33
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,524
And the drought
in the provinces?

34
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,070
We sent Weatherworkers
but the results were disappointing.

35
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:57,078
Soon it may be too late
for the spring planting.

36
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,584
Why have these misfortunes
befallen us, Root?

37
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,749
I sense the Light dimming,
Your Majesty.

38
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,292
The Light?

39
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:10,009
The Light of the Balance
that sustains the world.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,377
Your Majesty!

41
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,844
What now?

42
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,509
Terrible news!

43
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,758
Dragons have been sighted
off the coast!

44
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:21,638
- Dragons?
- Two, Majesty. One was killed.

45
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:27,814
Dragons here, in the East?
Can this really be true?

46
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,485
Long ago, dragons
and men were one.

47
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:37,654
But men who coveted possessions
chose the land and the sea.

48
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,577
Dragons who wanted freedom,
chose wind and fire.

49
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,953
Since then, dragons and men
remained apart.

50
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:50,253
To hear that dragons have been seen,
and were even fighting...

51
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:54,504
The twilight that threatens
us is ever deepening.

52
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,386
Bring the captain to me.
I would hear more of this.

53
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,643
Root, I want you there too.

54
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,528
Please... Your Majesty!

55
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,739
- We'll get in trouble!
- I have to!

56
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,200
- What is it?
- Have you seen Prince Arren?

57
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,662
He's been gone since last night.

58
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,156
Prince Arren? Gone?

59
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,498
That's enough.

60
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,042
His Majesty is occupied.

61
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,589
Surely you can see that.

62
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,087
Forgive me.

63
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,591
It's just... he seems so sad lately.
We were worried.

64
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,604
That's absurd!
Arren is 17, not a child.

65
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,399
Forgive this disturbance, Your Majesty.

66
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,440
Your people are more important.

67
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,147
- Very well, then.
- Your Majesty.

68
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,486
I must tend
to my correspondence.

69
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,908
We await your command, sire.

70
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,923
I'm imagining things.

71
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,122
Arren!

72
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,927
So you are my death...

73
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,228
Are you hurt?

74
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,990
Steady there, lad!

75
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,357
Ls this what you seek?

76
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,531
This is dangerous country
for travelers.

77
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,361
You were lucky this time.
You must be hungry.

78
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,365
It's not much,
but you're welcome to it.

79
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,621
What is your name, lad?

80
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,168
My name is Arren.

81
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,551
Arren, is it?
It means sword, doesn't it?

82
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,390
So you hail from Enlad.

83
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,559
How did you know?

84
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,397
That blade
was forged with magic.

85
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,398
I doubt you could unsheathe it.

86
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,078
What is it?

87
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,746
It's nothing.

88
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,429
Arren?

89
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,601
If you have nowhere to go,
why not come with me?

90
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,398
I doubt our meeting here
was an accident.

91
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,447
And I'd welcome
a companion on the road.

92
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,784
Arren! Are you coming?

93
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,793
What should I call you?

94
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,293
Call me Sparrowhawk.

95
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,736
Another abandoned farm.
Farmers leaving their land...

96
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,865
There's more to this
than poor harvests.

97
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,706
Come, Arren.
We'd better push on.

98
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,169
Lord Sparrowhawk?

99
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,509
Sparrowhawk will do.
What is it?

100
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,803
Sparrowhawk?

101
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,013
Where are we heading?

102
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,010
First, we go to the next town.
But after that...

103
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,347
...even I don't know.

104
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,411
- Getting tired?
- No.

105
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,409
Come along.
We're almost there.

106
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,436
There it is.

107
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,232
Hort Town.

108
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,805
Are they prisoners?

109
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,553
They are slaves.

110
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,302
Here, people are goods
to buy and sell.

111
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,687
Trading in human lives!

112
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,145
Two guineas, gentlemen!
Do I hear two guineas?

113
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,859
I have two guineas!

114
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:21,027
Three! Sold to the gentleman
for three guineas!

115
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,159
No, sorry!
Couldn't possibly find room!

116
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,222
Gauzes from Sowl!
Silks from Lorbanery!

117
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,566
Furs and felts and woolens!

118
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,856
Ls this a market day?

119
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,071
No. it's like this year round.

120
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,567
Silks and satins!
Canvass and fleecefells!

121
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,786
What can I show you?

122
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,078
This is Lorbanery's finest silk!

123
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,542
Fine as a mayfly's wing!

124
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:19,540
I don't have a wife.
I need a cloak for my friend.

125
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,591
Wizards! No girlfriend, eh?

126
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:28,636
- But I don't need a cloak.
- You can't go about like that.

127
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,801
You should hide
that thing on your belt.

128
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,098
What about this?

129
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,230
Fleece from Gont.
Highest quality.

130
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:41,228
Four warp strings.
This is Andradean work.

131
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,481
On Gont they use six or more.

132
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,036
You used to be a sorceress.
Why are you selling fakes?

133
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,994
People don't believe
in foolish tricks any more.

134
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,997
My goods are
not what I claim.

135
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,296
But at least they're real...

136
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,043
...not mere lies and air
like magic and sorcery!

137
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,131
Sparrowhawk!

138
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,303
Thank you!

139
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,552
What!

140
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,471
Unhand me!

141
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,842
Calm yourself, young master.

142
00:18:55,551 --> 00:19:01,058
I have something for you.
it's the door to bliss.

143
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,525
What is it?

144
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,108
Hazia, my lord. Ha-zi-a.

145
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,526
Take one.
Leave sorrow and fear behind.

146
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,984
No more sorrow or fear...

147
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:16,535
You'll never be troubled
with the pain of this world again.

148
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,331
You needn't pay me.
it's my pleasure.

149
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,330
Arren.

150
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,792
What are you doing?

151
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,544
Ls this your friend, my lord?

152
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:35,558
And what about you?
Don't wizards have troubles too?

153
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,055
I'm sorry. I have no use
for what you're selling.

154
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,685
Save us from the arrogance
of sorcerers!

155
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,237
I suppose you've lost
your powers too!

156
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:54,785
Hazia is not something
to toy with, Arren. Look!

157
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:59,207
The hazia eater feels
himself in paradise.

158
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:04,375
Then the spirit leaves the body
and wanders aimlessly in darkness.

159
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:09,546
When it returns? More hazia.
And finally, death.

160
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,798
What's the matter?

161
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,566
Feeling better?

162
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,739
The wind is fresh up here.

163
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,903
Something's wrong with this town.

164
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,452
Not only this town, lad.

165
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,666
Farmers' crops wither.
Their sheep and cattle are falling sick.

166
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,790
Even people's minds
have lost their way.

167
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,293
Is it some sort of pestilence?

168
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:57,299
No. A pestilence
is how the Balance restores itself.

169
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:01,306
But this? I fear someone
is trying to destroy the Balance.

170
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:06,149
There's only one creature
in Earthsea capable of such evil.

171
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,770
Only one.

172
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,823
Well then.
Shall we go back to the inn?

173
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,159
I'd like to rest a little longer.

174
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,823
Very well.

175
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,332
I'll be waiting.
Keep your wits about you.

176
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,250
I will.

177
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,866
Slave takers?

178
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,851
A witch, are you?

179
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,062
And an ugly one at that!

180
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,610
Won't fetch much with that face.

181
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,945
Just a few guineas.
But we can still have a little fun.

182
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,068
Oww! My finger!

183
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,329
The witch has spirit!

184
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,324
I'm going to enjoy this.

185
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,450
Who's there?

186
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,245
Step forward and show yourself!

187
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,135
Well, well.

188
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,760
What are you
doing here, boy?

189
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,383
Go ahead. Take him!

190
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,311
No hard feelings, boy.
Just following the boss's orders.

191
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,809
I'll make it quick.

192
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,356
Or maybe you'd like to be a slave?

193
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,150
Beg for your life!

194
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,369
Changed your mind?

195
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,626
Life is nothing to me.

196
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,339
So you want a fight, eh?

197
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,463
Draw your sword!

198
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,937
All right. Now it's my turn.

199
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,539
Uh oh.

200
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:02,718
Hold on there son.
You don't care about the girl?

201
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,047
DO it.

202
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,387
If you want her so much,
here she is!

203
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,649
Come on men!
Let's go!

204
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,365
Are you...

205
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,037
Therru!

206
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,203
Therru!

207
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,422
Therru...

208
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,666
A bird...

209
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,808
So! We meet again, boy.

210
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,518
Take him!

211
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,691
He'll fetch a good price.
Don't be too rough.

212
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,330
Take him away!

213
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:44,838
Just an old piece of junk.
Couldn't give it away!

214
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,592
Give it up, it's no use.

215
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:31,551
Quiet!

216
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:35,222
Silence!
Or I'll feed you to the hounds!

217
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:05,870
Come on!

218
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,792
Get moving!

219
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,378
What's going on?

220
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:13,969
I don't know.
Move, you lazy animals!

221
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,430
Confound it! What's wrong?

222
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,458
Sparrowhawk...

223
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,462
Let's go, Arren.

224
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,973
Can YOU stand?

225
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,562
What about the others?

226
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:17,317
I left none bound.
Now it's up to them.

227
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,381
How did you know
where to find me?

228
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:42,178
When you didn't come,
I scoured Hort Town.

229
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:46,853
Finally, someone told me
a young man was taken by slavers.

230
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:51,192
I had to make
a spell of finding.

231
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,855
I am sorry, I was foolish.

232
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,074
No, it was my fault.

233
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,785
I should've been more careful.

234
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,909
I'm sorry.

235
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:09,386
Who's there?

236
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,809
It's me, Sparrowhawk.

237
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,307
Sparrowhawk?

238
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,149
Someone's been hurt.

239
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,826
I'm sorry. It's late.

240
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,826
It's been a long time, Ged.

241
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,251
He's asleep.

242
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:46,515
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid you've lost your bed.

243
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,977
It's his now.
Here, this will warm you.

244
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,015
Thanks.

245
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,693
You haven't changed.

246
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:05,818
No.
You're keeping well, Tenar?

247
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,871
I suppose.
It hasn't always been easy.

248
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:10,830
And you?

249
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,116
Do you still wander?

250
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,334
That was good.

251
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,837
It has been a long time.

252
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,046
Yes, it has.

253
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,840
As Archmage, I have no time...

254
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,721
...to wander as I once did.

255
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:31,052
And what brings the Archmage
so far from home?

256
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,849
Evil tidings come
from every corner of Earthsea.

257
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,351
Things are out of balance...

258
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:44,068
...as if the sun's light
were ebbing.

259
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:48,073
Ls the Art Magic ebbing too?

260
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:53,575
Yes. As if our very blood
were flowing from our veins.

261
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,326
So you Search for the answer?

262
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,498
YES.

263
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,336
Oh dear, we woke you up.

264
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:10,341
Come, child. Don't worry.
This man is an old friend of mine.

265
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:18,519
This is Therru.
She's been with me five years.

266
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:24,317
Call me Sparrowhawk.
I'm sorry I woke you.

267
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:28,616
Hawk?

268
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,411
Well, you should be honored.
Therru never speaks to strangers.

269
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:39,919
What is it?

270
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,925
Could she really be...?

271
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,104
Lord Cob.

272
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,275
Enter.

273
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,739
Forgive my intrusion.
I beg leave to speak.

274
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:58,866
What is it?

275
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,869
I'm afraid some
of our slaves escaped.

276
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,881
I see. You let
my precious merchandise go.

277
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:10,673
No. We've captured most of them.

278
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,841
And?

279
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,886
What about the others?

280
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,891
We're scouring the countryside.
We'll find them.

281
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,020
You're a fool.

282
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,940
Do you think
I can't manage without you?

283
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:37,447
It was a wizard!
A wizard with a scar on his face!

284
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,163
What?

285
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,454
A scar on his face?

286
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:48,377
It's Sparrowhawk.
The Archmage pays me a visit.

287
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:52,382
Find him for me,
Hare... or else.

288
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,880
I won't fail you, my lord.

289
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:05,224
I've waited long
for this day... Sparrowhawk.

290
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,933
Tenar! I brought the water in!

291
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,597
Where is she?

292
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,308
Tenar? Are you still asleep?

293
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:50,818
Tenaf?

294
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,488
Are you sick?

295
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,155
Who was that?

296
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,125
It's that girl!

297
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:13,417
That must've been a surprise.
I'm sorry dear. I should've told you.

298
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,545
Don't worry. Arren is with me.

299
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,800
You have nothing to fear.

300
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,802
Sometimes his eyes are wild,
but he has a good heart.

301
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:28,519
Good morning.

302
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,526
Good morning.

303
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,904
I'm done eating!

304
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,022
Well!

305
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,322
Did you sleep well?
How do you feel?

306
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,659
I'm all right.

307
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,533
I didn't do anything to her.

308
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,745
Of course you didn't.
Come have breakfast.

309
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,171
Can't work if you don't eat.

310
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,044
Work?

311
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,208
Ouch...

312
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,707
Are you getting blisters?

313
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,045
YES.

314
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,757
Shall we rest a bit?

315
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,681
What a good smell.

316
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,596
- But...
- Yes, lad?

317
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,765
You're a wizard, aren't you?

318
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,354
Oh, I see.

319
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:55,444
You want to know why a wizard
toils in the field like a farmer?

320
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,436
YES.

321
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,113
Listen, Arren.

322
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:03,952
Everything under the sun
and stars depends on the Balance.

323
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:08,994
The wind and seas.
The power of earth and light.

324
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:16,214
All that these do is well
and rightly done within the Equilibrium.

325
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:21,550
But now, men hold
the power to control the world.

326
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:25,011
So Man must learn
to keep the Balance...

327
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:29,978
...and do what leaf and whale
and wind do of their own nature.

328
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,807
You know everything
has its True Name.

329
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:39,905
Magic is the power to command,
if you know a thing's True Name.

330
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:45,073
Use that power in ignorance
and the Balance is easily damaged.

331
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,368
Spells should be made
only of necessity.

332
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,115
You've been busy.

333
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,998
I suppose you two
deserve some lunch.

334
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,006
Are you feeling better, Arren?

335
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:03,757
Now eat hearty,
or you won't get your strength back.

336
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,306
What about the girl?

337
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,345
Oh, Therru?

338
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,515
One of the spring lambs is sick.

339
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,013
She's nursing it today.

340
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:18,935
Shall we change places?

341
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,653
No, I can manage.

342
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:35,035
- How did it go?
- That's it for today.

343
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,625
Dinner will be ready soon.
Better wash up.

344
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,220
- I'll put the ox in the stable.
- Thanks, lad.

345
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:03,113
There, you should be feeling better.
Now you need your mother's milk.

346
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,568
That's it.

347
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,579
Good girl.

348
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,088
What do you want?

349
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,756
Oh... nothing.

350
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,713
Why did you come here?

351
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:32,092
To hurt me?
To kill this little one?

352
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,061
You don't understand!
I was just...

353
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,933
Stay away! Get out of here!

354
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,945
I hate anyone who doesn't value life!

355
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:48,949
I'm sorry.

356
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,581
Step aside!

357
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,714
Let's eat.

358
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:08,883
It's so good having men
to help with the farm.

359
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,096
Even you two.

360
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:15,094
I'm no good with a plow,
but I do know animals.

361
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,472
You used to be a goatherd.

362
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,769
What's wrong, Arren?
Aren't you hungry?

363
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,567
No.

364
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,356
What is this place?

365
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,711
Come, Arren. This way.

366
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,338
Sparrowhawk?

367
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,567
Come. Take my hand.

368
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,240
Arren!

369
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,327
No! Leave me alone! Stop!

370
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:01,575
Arren!

371
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,921
Arren! Wake up!

372
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,506
Arren!

373
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,681
What's wrong?

374
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,274
A bad dream, I think.

375
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,852
A dream...

376
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:43,291
Spring is very short, you know.
I need all the help I can get.

377
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:47,787
I'm sorry, Tenar.
I have an errand that cannot wait.

378
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,623
I still can't rely on you.

379
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,967
Come now, Tenar.

380
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,796
Should you be taking Arren's horse?

381
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:01,972
He's better off without it.
Tell him I borrowed it.

382
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:06,306
Tenar. Keep a close eye
on him for me.

383
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,308
I promise.

384
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:12,942
I'll be back tonight!
And back at work tomorrow!

385
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,527
I certainly hope so.

386
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,172
Haven't seen him around here.

387
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,344
And that scar!

388
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,972
He must've come
from that woman's house.

389
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:47,723
She's a witch.
I don't like the looks of it.

390
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:53,070
Yes, she's an odd one.
And that little girl she keeps!

391
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:57,069
That child will bring
bad luck on us all.

392
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,193
No! Don't say that out loud!

393
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,449
Who was that?

394
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:08,702
He's not from around here.

395
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,578
He's a friend of ours.

396
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,626
He's helping us out.

397
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,248
Ls that so?

398
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,625
Can I help you?

399
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:20,718
My child has a fever ma'am.
I need that potion again.

400
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,886
All right. Just wait there.

401
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,354
Quit sticking to me!

402
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,144
I'm afraid!

403
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,606
Spare us from evil!

404
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,479
That's enough!

405
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:41,155
There. If the child's not better,
come see me again.

406
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,994
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

407
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,034
Actually, I was wondering...

408
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:50,251
Yes, I know.
Pay me when you can.

409
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:53,041
Thanks ma'am. You're very kind.

410
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,416
Hope she feels better!

411
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:01,262
I wish there were more
decent people in the world.

412
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,756
Therru never hurt anyone.

413
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:09,053
Well, at least the woman
looks after her own.

414
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:15,603
As for Therru, her parents
abused and abandoned her.

415
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:20,565
They burned her.
That's how she got that scar.

416
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:03,991
What a frightful Child!

417
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:06,611
My goodness!
Did you see her eyes?

418
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,831
Please, have mercy!

419
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:17,626
No one will buy
an old woman!

420
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:23,712
Nothing to fear ladies.
Maybe you can even help me.

421
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:28,432
Seen any strangers around here?
Be much obliged for any help.

422
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,681
And I'll pay.

423
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,227
There's one at Tenar's farm!

424
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,066
And one with a scar
on his face!

425
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,232
Tenar? Who's that?

426
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,106
The witch! She lives
right up this road.

427
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,699
Thanks for the help, old hags!

428
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,871
Wait! Where are you going?

429
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:56,669
Stop! Liar!
You promised to pay!

430
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,546
There it is! That's it!

431
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,845
What's that?

432
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,399
What are you doing?

433
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,689
You're looking fit, boy.
Didn't think I'd find you here.

434
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,657
Swine!
What are you doing here?

435
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:32,702
Now, now. I'm not here to fight.
Where's your wizard friend?

436
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:36,200
He's gone!
Sparrowhawk's not here.

437
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,412
You'd better not be hiding him.

438
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:41,585
Why should I?

439
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,425
You're no match for him.

440
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:49,930
Looks like she's telling the truth.
All right, we'll be back!

441
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,554
Till then!

442
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,725
Never come back, you swine!

443
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,729
Lord Cob will reward me for this!

444
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,086
So that's what happened.

445
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,458
Neither of you
said a word about it.

446
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,379
I think we fixed most of it.

447
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:30,755
Let's rebuild the fence.

448
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:38,763
Tenar? Have you known
Sparrowhawk for a long time?

449
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:42,141
Yes, I guess I have.
A long, long time.

450
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,646
He's always been a wanderer.

451
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:52,656
It's the life he chose.
He does it because he has to.

452
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:57,790
And finally he became Archmage,
the greatest of all wizards.

453
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,876
Head of the Great House of Roke?

454
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:04,668
Yes. But years before that,
he rescued me.

455
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:10,674
Rescued me, and
led me into the light.

456
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:18,974
One man, all alone.

457
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:24,479
He brought me out
of the Tombs of Atuan.

458
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:45,170
Welcome.

459
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:50,130
Don't get many wizards.
Looking for a weapon?

460
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,173
Show me that sword.

461
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,592
Can't recommend this one.

462
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,311
Very unusual workmanship,
so I bought it.

463
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,603
But it's rusted solid.
Can't be drawn.

464
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,317
You there, wizard!

465
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,992
Are you deaf?
I'm talking to you!

466
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,331
You said something, sir?

467
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:27,421
Is there something
stuck to my face?

468
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,665
Wrong wizard!

469
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:33,886
You! If you see a wizard
with a scar on his face...

470
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,926
...tell him Lord Cob
wants to see him!

471
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:41,887
Cob? Never heard that name
back where I come from.

472
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:45,230
You will, when he's Lord
of the Two Lands!

473
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,690
Don't forget it!

474
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,310
Yes sir.

475
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,197
I'll take the sword.
How much?

476
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:57,736
Wait a minute... your face!

477
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,319
What's wrong?

478
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,367
Nothing... I suppose.

479
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:05,118
Have you heard of
this wizard named Cob?

480
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:08,087
Careful! Keep your voice down.

481
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:13,668
Only wizard in these parts
who still has his powers.

482
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:17,467
Can't say he's loved
by people around here.

483
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:21,559
He lives in the fortress outside town.
Best keep away from there.

484
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:29,270
I never thought
I'd find you here, Cob.

485
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:41,283
You're good at farm work.
You hardly seem a beginner.

486
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,700
Thank you.

487
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:47,289
Won't you stay on
for a while and help?

488
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,412
Therru would like that too.

489
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,412
But...

490
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:54,292
You don't have to decide now.
Think about it, all right?

491
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,417
All right.

492
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,254
Stable the ox for me.

493
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,254
Yes, Tenar.

494
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:04,848
I'm home!

495
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:09,523
Therru? Now where is she?

496
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:19,946
Arren! I can't find Therru.
Check the back pasture for me.

497
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:22,821
Tell her to come inside
before dark.

498
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:24,329
I will.

499
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,344
Therru?

500
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:49,604
Therru...

501
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:55,854
Fan far above the clouds
against the setting sun

502
00:55:56,144 --> 00:56:03,198
A falcon flies alone
soaring in the wind

503
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:10,414
I hear his lonely cry
so sad must he be

504
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:16,754
Riding the silent wind
a falcon flies alone

505
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:24,258
Reaching out with his wings
grasps the empty sky

506
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:31,560
Riding the silent wind
never can he rest

507
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:40,073
What it is within my heart
none can ever know

508
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:47,030
A heart like a falcon's
is this very heart

509
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:53,954
What it is within my heart
none can ever know

510
00:56:54,244 --> 00:57:01,628
Lonely falcon in the empty sky

511
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:10,099
I walk alone along
deserted country roads

512
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:16,942
Walking with me side by side
you are always there

513
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:24,242
I feel your loneliness
lonely you must be

514
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:31,074
Crickets whispering
in the grassy fields

515
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:38,127
You walk there by my side
you walk the path with me

516
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:45,509
But you never say a word
never do you speak

517
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:54,180
What it is within my heart
none can ever know

518
00:57:54,638 --> 00:58:01,362
Here inside this heart
that walks its path alone

519
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:08,119
What it is within my heart
none can ever know

520
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:15,665
The sadness of one
who always is alone

521
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,018
I killed my father.

522
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:41,231
I stabbed him and ran away.

523
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:45,401
I don't understand it.
Why did I kill him?

524
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:48,071
Did he hurt you?

525
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,653
No. My father
was a great man.

526
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:57,035
I am nothing. I failed my father
and I fail myself.

527
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:02,839
And yet, I'm filled
with a rage I can't control.

528
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:07,466
It's as if there were
someone else inside me.

529
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,088
You saw it too, didn't you?

530
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:14,309
You were right.
I shouldn't be here.

531
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,269
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

532
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,263
No, you were right.

533
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,520
If I don't leave,
it will come again.

534
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,203
A woman?

535
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:39,827
She lives past the marshes.

536
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:43,835
And the Archmage is with her?

537
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:48,840
He was seen in the town.
There are many witnesses.

538
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,970
Splendid.

539
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,646
My lord.

540
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,559
Let's go, men!

541
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,879
A greeting from the Archmage.
Thank you, Sparrowhawk.

542
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:45,730
Therru! Arren!
Dinner is ready!

543
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:48,028
Where's Arren?

544
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,023
Isn't he with you?

545
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,023
No.

546
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:56,696
Maybe he's resting.
Therru, go see if he's there.

547
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:57,867
Yes, Tenar.

548
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:02,626
He's not here.

549
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:06,334
That's strange.
Where's he gone?

550
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,628
I'll look outside.

551
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,275
Arren...

552
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:44,747
Tenar, Therru... take care.

553
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,859
Doesn't matter
which way I go.

554
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,042
Looks like a dead end.

555
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:47,810
It's here!

556
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,217
I wonder if that's Arren?

557
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,020
Arren?

558
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,226
Sparrowhawk?

559
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,531
That's odd.

560
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:22,822
What are you doing?

561
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,075
It's you! You're back!

562
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:31,251
So sorry, but it seems
you'll do in place of the wizard.

563
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,118
What?

564
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,665
Tenar, what's wrong?

565
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:34,662
Run away!

566
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,289
What a surprise!

567
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,384
Fancy meeting you here, princess.

568
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:44,256
No! Leave her alone!

569
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,101
Therru!

570
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:58,111
Well now princess,
where's your prince?

571
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,063
Hey! Watch those teeth!

572
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:05,069
I need you to deliver a message.
Tell this to the wizard!

573
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,908
If he wants his woman...

574
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:11,909
...he can find her
at Lord Cob's castle.

575
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:13,959
Take her away!

576
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:14,874
Therru!

577
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,792
Tenar!

578
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:21,627
Let me go, I tell you!
Let me go!

579
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:29,093
Therru!
Are you all right? Therru!

580
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,390
Stop it! Let her go!

581
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:36,017
You stay here and be good
till the wizard gets back!

582
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:40,399
Lord Cob's waiting.
Let's get moving!

583
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,109
Tenar!

584
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,825
Tenar!

585
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:24,982
I'm sorry. I'm afraid
he's coming with me.

586
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,196
Go!

587
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:59,391
Where am I?

588
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:05,356
You're safe now.
The Shadow can't follow you here.

589
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,653
You saw it?

590
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:11,365
I know a bit of Magic myself.

591
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,660
I know what
you're running from.

592
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:18,876
You were wise
to flee from that man.

593
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,003
What man?

594
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:24,875
Sparrowhawk.
That is, the Archmage.

595
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:29,717
Here, drink this.
It will soothe you.

596
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:37,600
What's wrong?
it's not poisoned.

597
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:56,118
Now lie still
and rest here for a bit.

598
01:07:56,364 --> 01:08:00,790
The Archmage is more dangerous
than you can imagine.

599
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:04,415
No... Sparrowhawk is a good man.

600
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,792
He protected me.

601
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:12,134
Then tell me. Did you ever
wonder what he seeks?

602
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,134
No.

603
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:20,813
He seeks eternal life.

604
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:24,309
Eternal life?

605
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:29,648
The Archmage stands
at the pinnacle of sorcery.

606
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:35,074
Only the secret of eternal life
lies beyond his grasp.

607
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:38,452
And yet, he covets it.

608
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:43,453
But as he covets, so does he fear
another will discover it first.

609
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:49,085
That would be unbearable
to one so proud as the Archmage.

610
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:52,132
What does that have
to do with me?

611
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,884
Because it is you
who have been chosen...

612
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:59,477
...to gain the secret
of eternal life.

613
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:05,142
That's why Sparrowhawk
follows you. To kill you.

614
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,189
To bring me death...

615
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:10,648
Arren, will you come with me?

616
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:13,195
I've already found it.

617
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:16,570
I found the door
between life and death.

618
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,574
Together we can open that door.

619
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:23,331
And together,
we will live forever.

620
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:27,126
We will conquer every form
of fear and suffering.

621
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,590
Fear and suffering...

622
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:35,089
Come with me, Arren.
The face of death is terrible!

623
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:41,599
I don't want to die.

624
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:46,062
Listen to me, Arren.
Tell me your True Name.

625
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:49,607
Then you will have that
which you most desire.

626
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:56,660
Come, give me your True Name.

627
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:02,624
Lebannen...

628
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:12,709
Now I'm ready for you,
Sparrowhawk.

629
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:24,346
Where are you, Hawk?

630
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,216
Hawk!

631
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,471
What's wrong, Therru?

632
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:10,479
They came and took
Tenar away!

633
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:13,319
You have to go
to Cob's castle!

634
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:14,528
Where is Arren?

635
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:19,527
He left! He said it would
come again if he didn't go!

636
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:21,990
Cob...

637
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,530
Don't worry, Therru.

638
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:30,037
I'm going to help Tenar.
Wait for my return.

639
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:35,042
Keep this sword.
Arren will need it.

640
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:44,343
Stay home, Therru!

641
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,533
Here-we-are!

642
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,118
Come on!

643
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:08,536
I'm not going anywhere!

644
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:14,213
Lord Cob.

645
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:18,551
We brought the woman.
Just as you ordered.

646
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:22,513
You've done well, Hare.

647
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:27,890
It was nothing, my lord.
My pleasure is to serve you.

648
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,520
Stand aside!

649
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,230
Why, you!

650
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,099
Are you the boss?

651
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:37,107
Why did you kidnap me?
Let me go right now!

652
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:40,865
So sorry for the rough treatment.

653
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:43,110
I have business with Sparrowhawk.

654
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:48,414
You're a wizard, aren't you!
You should be ashamed!

655
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,909
Go find him yourself!

656
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:54,254
He's an old friend of mine.

657
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:57,419
I'd like to invite him here.

658
01:12:58,082 --> 01:13:01,757
And I'm the bait!
You're going to hurt him!

659
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:05,090
Women tax my patience.

660
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:07,550
Put her in the dungeon.

661
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:09,852
DO it!

662
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,271
Answer me!

663
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:16,101
If something happens to
Sparrowhawk, so help me!

664
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:18,690
Arren...

665
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:20,108
This way!

666
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:34,415
Come, Lebannen.
I have something special for you.

667
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,272
Get in there!

668
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:16,119
Make yourself at home.
You'll see your wizard soon enough.

669
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:37,273
This place reminds me
of the Tombs.

670
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:40,772
Sparrowhawk...

671
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:56,160
Cob! Are you making
the same mistake again?

672
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,300
At ease!

673
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:07,428
Any sign of the wizard?

674
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,422
Not yet, sir.

675
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:13,723
Where is that confounded wizard?

676
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:17,729
Let's see...

677
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,729
There he is!
Take your positions!

678
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,326
Here he comes!

679
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:42,585
Don't let him escape! Now!

680
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:48,753
Hear me! Open the path!

681
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:54,304
Stop! Wait!

682
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,516
He tricked us!

683
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,809
Well? Don't just stand there!

684
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:10,108
Cob! it's Sparrowhawk.
I'm here!

685
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:11,905
Show yourself!

686
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:19,291
It's been a long time,
Sparrowhawk.

687
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,786
I've been waiting.

688
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:25,418
Cob of Havnor!
I left you at the border...

689
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:27,341
...of the land of death.

690
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,129
I hear you're the Archmage now.

691
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:33,096
Congratulations.

692
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:37,267
I'm here, Cob.
Now release Tenar!

693
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:41,267
You're pitiful, Sparrowhawk.

694
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:45,643
The great Archmage,
smitten by a woman.

695
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:49,648
You used her to lure me here.
What do you want?

696
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,066
What do you think?

697
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:54,444
I haven't forgotten
how you dragged me...

698
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:57,287
...to the gates of the Dry Land.

699
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:00,079
But you've forgotten why!

700
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:02,668
You used
the Pelnish Lore...

701
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:06,372
...to toy with the spirits
of the living and the dead.

702
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:08,500
Isn't that enough to repent?

703
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:13,300
You taught me a splendid lesson
there at death's door.

704
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:16,557
Now I know I can
never accept extinction.

705
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:21,183
So I gathered every
ancient lore book I could find.

706
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:25,479
Alas, some of their owners
were not cooperative.

707
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:29,987
What evil are you planning, Cob?

708
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:33,532
I've done it, Sparrowhawk!

709
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:36,653
I've woven the greatest spell of all.

710
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:40,327
The door between life and death
has been closed...

711
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:44,168
...since the beginning of time.
But I will open it!

712
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,085
That is forbidden!
Don't you understand?

713
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,926
Those with power
must wield it with wisdom.

714
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:55,008
Would you destroy the Balance
that sustains the world?

715
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,848
What nonsense!

716
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,014
The Balance is long gone.

717
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:04,514
You know that
better than anyone.

718
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:07,016
The Balance was destroyed by Man.

719
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:13,027
You think you can limit
Man's desire? it's impossible!

720
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:16,116
I will live forever.

721
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:19,032
I will gain existence without end!

722
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:24,747
Cob! Without the cycle
of death and rebirth, there is no life!

723
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:27,415
I am above Nature!

724
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:38,264
Sparrowhawk! There's someone else
who wants to meet you.

725
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:49,934
Arren! What are you doing here?

726
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:54,565
Lebannen! This man would
deprive you of eternal life!

727
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:04,414
Arren! Did you reveal
your True Name?

728
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:09,996
I'm going to live forever!

729
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:17,007
I'm tired, Sparrowhawk.
Tired of living in fear.

730
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:20,382
Arren! Life without death is not life!

731
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:25,011
Refuse death, and
you refuse life as well!

732
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,934
Don't lie to me!

733
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:49,038
Listen to me, Arren.

734
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:53,289
No man nor any thing
in this world lives forever.

735
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:57,673
But only to us is it given
to know that we must die.

736
01:19:58,002 --> 01:20:02,473
And that is a precious gift.

737
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:08,847
This life that is our torment
and our treasure does not endure.

738
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:11,349
It is a wave on the sea.

739
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:15,694
Would you force the sea
to grow still, to save one wave?

740
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:17,814
To save yourself?

741
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:29,867
Arren...

742
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:42,846
Thought you made
a fool of me?

743
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,474
There's more than
one entrance to this castle!

744
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:50,388
What's happening?
I'm getting weak.

745
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:56,026
Coming here was another
of your blunders, Sparrowhawk.

746
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:58,862
Your powers are useless
in this place.

747
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:03,196
Hare! Put him in the
dungeon with the woman.

748
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,069
I'll finish them tomorrow...

749
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:08,740
...in the most painful
and humiliating way.

750
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:10,874
Yes, my lord.

751
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:13,369
On your feet, chickenhawk!

752
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:37,776
Sparrowhawk!

753
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:41,940
Sparrowhawk! Are you all right?
Sparrowhawk!

754
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:44,066
It'll all be over tomorrow.

755
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:47,445
Say your goodbyes
while you still have time!

756
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:00,290
Sparrowhawk! Sparrowhawk!

757
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:02,801
Tenar...

758
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:06,639
How did they do this?
You're the Archmage!

759
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:11,386
I'm sorry, Tenar.
I keep getting you into trouble.

760
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:13,763
Stop talking nonsense!

761
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,827
Which way should I go?

762
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:40,463
Arren?

763
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:48,013
Arren! Wait!

764
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:53,519
Arren! Cob's men came
and took Tenar away!

765
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:08,492
Arren, your sword!
Sparrowhawk said to give it to you!

766
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:17,289
Follow you?

767
01:23:57,491 --> 01:24:00,995
Tenar is a prisoner here.

768
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:02,246
Sparrowhawk too.

769
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:04,714
Even Sparrowhawk.

770
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:09,011
This is yours, isn't it?
Sparrowhawk brought it for you.

771
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:13,557
We've got to hurry.
They need our help!

772
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:19,059
I can go no further.
You must go alone.

773
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:22,775
Bring me that sword.

774
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,269
I know you can do it.

775
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:29,778
What do you mean?
You're right here.

776
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:32,447
I'm not here.

777
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,284
Cob is holding me
against my will.

778
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:38,870
Then who are you?

779
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:41,456
Stay away! Get back!

780
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:44,080
Don't come closer!

781
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,929
Arren's heart was always
full of fear.

782
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:57,096
The fear filled his heart
with darkness.

783
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,100
Fear of what?

784
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:04,608
The darkness stole his body
and ran away with it.

785
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:07,815
But it left something
important behind.

786
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:17,868
Wherever there is darkness,
there also you will find light.

787
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:20,332
Now the light
that was left behind...

788
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,955
...wanders alone,
like a shadow.

789
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:24,836
A Shadow?

790
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:31,799
What you see now is just
a shadow chasing its body.

791
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:40,511
Father...

792
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:45,107
You are Arren, aren't you?

793
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:50,654
Don't worry.
I'll be with you.

794
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:54,237
I'll give you my True Name.

795
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:59,742
My True Name
is Lebannen... Lebannen.

796
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:02,995
Lebannen...

797
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:17,858
lt's him.

798
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:24,532
He should be ashamed
to call himself Archmage!

799
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:27,956
Remember who
he was up against.

800
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:30,295
No wizard in Earthsea
is a match for Lord Cob!

801
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:31,789
Well spoken!

802
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:37,344
By the way, what's our
little friend up to?

803
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:39,929
He shut himself in his room.

804
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,925
Arren's really here!

805
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:45,969
He's a lucky one, that boy.

806
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:50,896
It's just like Lord Cob
to steal the wizard's apprentice.

807
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:53,940
He's not much
use though, is he?

808
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:55,737
None at all.

809
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:59,609
When we're through with
the wizard, we'll sell the boy!

810
01:28:09,075 --> 01:28:12,170
All right! Go get
Sparrowhawk and his woman.

811
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:16,167
The Archmage's time
has finally run out!

812
01:28:18,084 --> 01:28:20,178
They're going to kill them.

813
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:37,293
Arren!

814
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,091
Arren?

815
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:46,302
What are you doing here?
Did they kidnap you too?

816
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:57,734
Here. This belongs to you.

817
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:01,400
I'm not worthy to hold
my father's sword.

818
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:05,951
Arren, they've got Tenar
and Sparrowhawk.

819
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:07,740
They're going to kill them.

820
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:10,785
Please! Help them
like you helped me!

821
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:13,534
I can't help anyone.

822
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:16,787
All I Can do is fail.

823
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:18,914
What's wrong with you?

824
01:30:18,914 --> 01:30:21,667
They'll die
if we don't do something!

825
01:30:26,046 --> 01:30:29,596
They'll die!
We'll lose both of them!

826
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:42,446
We'll lose the most important
thing in the world.

827
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:47,651
Therru?

828
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,536
What's the most important thing?

829
01:30:57,202 --> 01:30:59,546
Life is the most important thing!

830
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:05,260
We'll all die someday.
What does it matter?

831
01:31:05,752 --> 01:31:11,134
Why fight for life?
We know it's going to end anyway.

832
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:15,012
No! Life is precious because
we know we're going to die!

833
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:19,687
You're not afraid of death.
You're afraid of life!

834
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:23,065
You want to live forever,
then you say nothing matters.

835
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:25,109
It's the same thing!

836
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:28,367
You're afraid to live
the only life you have!

837
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:30,697
Therru...

838
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:33,325
You think your life
belongs to you?

839
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:40,079
Tenar gave me life.
That's why I have to live...

840
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:43,048
...to give life to someone else.

841
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:48,219
Lebannen...

842
01:31:49,462 --> 01:31:52,557
That's the only way
we live forever.

843
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:10,526
Therru... how did you know
my True Name?

844
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:12,990
You told me yourself.

845
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:20,456
Now I'll tell you mine.
My True Name is...

846
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:23,422
Tehanu... it's Tehanu.

847
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:25,916
Tehanu...

848
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,448
it'll be dawn soon.

849
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:54,369
Come on, Therru.
We've got to help them!

850
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:05,626
Arren, wait!

851
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:07,464
What is it?

852
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:08,504
There!

853
01:33:14,047 --> 01:33:15,890
It's Sparrowhawk and Tenar!

854
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:17,967
Come on!

855
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:23,473
Jump!

856
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:26,151
I can't! it's too far!

857
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:28,144
Don't worry!
You can do it!

858
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:36,410
Let's go!

859
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:05,311
Sparrowhawk!

860
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:09,523
Time to say goodbye,
Sparrowhawk.

861
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:13,489
Your lover is going
on a journey.

862
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:16,030
Why don't you
send him off yourself?

863
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:25,164
Don't worry, Sparrowhawk.

864
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:28,164
This world will be
in good hands after you're gone.

865
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:32,459
What can I do, Sparrowhawk?

866
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:34,169
Tenar.

867
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:39,182
It's not over yet.
The sun will rise soon.

868
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,385
What do you mean?

869
01:34:43,595 --> 01:34:48,726
Don't you hear it, Tenar?
Help is almost here.

870
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:54,697
That's enough time
for goodbyes.

871
01:34:55,148 --> 01:34:57,651
Do it! Finish him!

872
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:58,867
No!

873
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:04,036
Let them go!

874
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:05,791
Ll'S you!

875
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,376
Arren! Therru!

876
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:10,038
Stay out of this, boy!

877
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,549
Don't show him any mercy!

878
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:15,419
Get back!

879
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:21,887
Take him!

880
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:35,779
Please don't hurt me!

881
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:38,362
I'm disappointed.

882
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:41,786
I thought you
and I had an understanding.

883
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:45,790
Silence!
You don't control me any more.

884
01:35:46,115 --> 01:35:50,586
Then you shall see
the face of death, Lebannen!

885
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:58,302
A summoning spell!

886
01:36:03,508 --> 01:36:04,475
Arren!

887
01:36:04,467 --> 01:36:05,935
Stay back!

888
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:09,222
Now die!

889
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:31,828
Please! Let me draw it.

890
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:34,747
For Life!

891
01:37:12,368 --> 01:37:15,872
That sword was
forged with magic!

892
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:41,235
He's an old man!

893
01:37:41,773 --> 01:37:43,741
Disguised by sorcery.

894
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:46,327
Lord Cob!

895
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,374
You can't stop me.

896
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:54,578
I will never accept death.

897
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:58,753
Wizards shouldn't fear death!

898
01:37:59,207 --> 01:38:01,255
You wretched girl!

899
01:38:02,251 --> 01:38:03,924
I'm not like you!

900
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,764
I'm better than you.
Insignificant worms!

901
01:38:07,215 --> 01:38:09,764
I studied the wisdom of the ages!

902
01:38:09,759 --> 01:38:13,354
I wield power! I am almighty!

903
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:19,816
Scorned as a fool by
the wizards of Roke.

904
01:38:19,811 --> 01:38:21,939
Driven out like a dog!

905
01:38:23,773 --> 01:38:28,119
But I'll have my revenge.
I will never die.

906
01:38:28,111 --> 01:38:31,456
I'll be the supreme Archmage!

907
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:47,804
Therru!

908
01:39:20,246 --> 01:39:21,839
Therru!

909
01:39:30,256 --> 01:39:32,179
That little fool!

910
01:39:32,592 --> 01:39:36,813
Hear me, stones.
I unbind you!

911
01:40:27,772 --> 01:40:29,900
Sunrise...

912
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,157
Let me go!

913
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:39,993
Does it hurt, girl?

914
01:40:39,992 --> 01:40:41,084
Cob!

915
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:44,376
Let her go!

916
01:40:44,705 --> 01:40:46,673
Stay back!

917
01:40:46,666 --> 01:40:49,761
Death is terrifying!

918
01:40:50,795 --> 01:40:51,921
Don't do it!

919
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:58,553
So terrifying.

920
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:04,149
Wait!

921
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:31,586
So terrifying... very terrifying...

922
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:34,968
Cob! You're just like me.

923
01:41:35,464 --> 01:41:39,139
You turn away from light
and see only darkness!

924
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:43,014
No! Keep away!

925
01:41:45,266 --> 01:41:47,894
You forgot that all life
is connected.

926
01:41:48,227 --> 01:41:51,231
Life can't be hoarded,
it can only be given!

927
01:41:51,814 --> 01:41:55,068
Deny death,
and you deny life!

928
01:41:55,484 --> 01:41:58,112
No! You're wrong!

929
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:03,288
Face the truth, Cob!
Everyone fears death!

930
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:09,166
No! I don't want to die.

931
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:11,296
Cob!

932
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:13,628
No!

933
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:15,842
Therru!

934
01:42:26,891 --> 01:42:29,144
Therru... Arren...

935
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:39,866
Arren!

936
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:52,755
Time to die! Time to die!

937
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,002
Arren!

938
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:57,380
And you will join him.

939
01:43:03,469 --> 01:43:06,188
Let her go! Don't kill her!

940
01:43:08,933 --> 01:43:13,029
All who oppose me must die!

941
01:43:42,675 --> 01:43:46,600
She's dead, she's dead.
Poor thing.

942
01:43:57,356 --> 01:43:59,575
Sun is rising.

943
01:44:03,446 --> 01:44:06,700
Hurry... must hurry...

944
01:44:06,699 --> 01:44:08,121
Stop!

945
01:44:45,404 --> 01:44:46,781
Therru!

946
01:44:54,371 --> 01:44:58,251
Eternal life!

947
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:05,474
Shadow, return to darkness!

948
01:45:07,259 --> 01:45:09,682
Give me life!

949
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:18,689
I want life... life!

950
01:45:25,611 --> 01:45:27,204
Life!

951
01:45:32,493 --> 01:45:35,667
I want to live!

952
01:46:05,901 --> 01:46:08,905
Tehanu!

953
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:54,245
So you're safe too.

954
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:00,873
What about them?

955
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:05,886
They'll be fine.
They have wings.

956
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:31,722
Thank you... Therru.

957
01:48:38,137 --> 01:48:40,936
I'm going back
to pay for my crime.

958
01:48:42,099 --> 01:48:44,602
And to face myself.

959
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:47,904
Arren.

960
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:53,570
Can I come to see you
again someday?

961
01:48:59,283 --> 01:49:00,375
Come on.

962
01:49:00,576 --> 01:49:03,750
We have to thank
Sparrowhawk and Tenar.
