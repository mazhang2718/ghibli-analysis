NÃÂ¿w the latest weather fÃÂ¿recast
fÃÂ¿r nÃÂ¿rthwest KÃÂ¿rikÃÂ¿.

3
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,316
Skies are clearing up,
thanks to a high-pressure front...

4
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,528
moÃÂ½ing in from the continent.

5
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,282
Mild winds will be
blowing in from the northwest...

6
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,160
clearing ÃÂ¿ut the clÃÂ¿uds by this evening.

7
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,413
We'll alsÃÂ¿ have
a beautiful full moon tonight.

8
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:44,168
ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¿mÃÂ¿rrÃÂ¿w - fair.
Day after tomorrow - fair.

9
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,589
MÃÂ¿re news in just a minute.

10
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,134
First, a word from today's sponsor.

11
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,290
Jiji, I'ÃÂ½e decided!
I'm gÃÂ¿nna dÃÂ¿ it tÃÂ¿night!

12
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,752
ÃÂÃÂ¿m!

13
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,881
Hi, ÃÂiss DÃÂ¿ra.
It's gÃÂ¿nna be cÃÂ¿mpletely clear tÃÂ¿night.

14
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,301
I heard the weather fÃÂ¿recast.
ÃÂ¤here's gÃÂ¿nna be a big full mÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿n.

15
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,763
Did yÃÂ¿u bÃÂ¿rrÃÂ¿w yÃÂ¿ur father's radiÃÂ¿
withÃÂ¿ut permissiÃÂ¿n again?

16
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,681
It's ÃÂ¿kay, isn't it?

17
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,142
ÃÂappy tÃÂ¿ see yÃÂ¿u, ÃÂiss DÃÂ¿ra.

18
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,269
ÃÂÃÂ¿m, my mind's made up.
It's tÃÂ¿night.

19
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,980
Weren't yÃÂ¿u gÃÂ¿ing tÃÂ¿ put it ÃÂ¿ff a mÃÂ¿nth?

20
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,650
But the next full mÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿n
might be ÃÂ¿n a clÃÂ¿udy night.

21
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,195
I want tÃÂ¿ make sure I leaÃÂ½e
ÃÂ¿n the perfect night.

22
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,696
Kiki, wait!

23
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,620
ÃÂy, my.
What's this leaÃÂ½ing business?

24
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,498
It's ÃÂ¿ne ÃÂ¿f ÃÂ¿ur ÃÂ¿ld custÃÂ¿ms.

25
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,709
ÃÂt 13, a witch leaÃÂ½es hÃÂ¿me
fÃÂ¿r a year ÃÂ¿f training.

26
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,504
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿ur little baby is 13?

27
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,799
ÃÂy, my.
ÃÂ¤ime flies sÃÂ¿ quickly, dÃÂ¿esn't it?

28
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:17,219
I'm afraid sÃÂ¿. But nÃÂ¿bÃÂ¿dy
leaÃÂ½es hÃÂ¿me that yÃÂ¿ung anymÃÂ¿re.

29
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,222
I remember perfectly well...

30
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,808
the exact day yÃÂ¿u arriÃÂ½ed in this tÃÂ¿wn.

31
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,686
ÃÂ little 13-year-ÃÂ¿ld girl
came dÃÂ¿wn frÃÂ¿m the sky...

32
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,522
riding a brÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿mstick, her eyes shining.

33
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:33,068
I thÃÂ¿ught yÃÂ¿u were a bit full ÃÂ¿f yÃÂ¿urself.

34
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,237
But Kiki still has much tÃÂ¿ learn.

35
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,656
She hardly knÃÂ¿ws any ÃÂ¿f my pÃÂ¿tiÃÂ¿ns.

36
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,993
ÃÂfter I'm gÃÂ¿ne,
whÃÂ¿ will make this medicine?

37
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,911
Sign ÃÂ¿f the times, I'm afraid.

38
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,038
ÃÂÃÂ½erything changes, bit by bit.

39
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:49,918
But I haÃÂ½e tÃÂ¿ say,
nÃÂ¿thing wÃÂ¿rks as well fÃÂ¿r my rheumatism.

40
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:55,382
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u're always telling me tÃÂ¿ hurry!
NÃÂ¿w whÃÂ¿'s the slÃÂ¿wpÃÂ¿ke?

41
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,596
I think it's better tÃÂ¿ leaÃÂ½e
with decÃÂ¿rum and great dignity.

42
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:05,058
If we put it ÃÂ¿ff fÃÂ¿r a mÃÂ¿nth, and I find
sÃÂ¿me wÃÂ¿nderful bÃÂ¿yfriend, then what?

43
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,727
We'll neÃÂ½er leaÃÂ½e!

44
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,480
I'm wÃÂ¿rried abÃÂ¿ut this.
Once yÃÂ¿u'ÃÂ½e decided, yÃÂ¿u can't gÃÂ¿ back.

45
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,732
Of cÃÂ¿urse.
I knÃÂ¿w that.

46
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,942
GÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d.
It's there.

47
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,404
I'm sÃÂ¿ excited!
It's like getting a birthday present!

48
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,785
Dad!

49
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,496
I'ÃÂ½e decided tÃÂ¿ gÃÂ¿ away tÃÂ¿night!

50
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,291
- ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¿night?
- ÃÂ¥eah! I just decided!

51
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,295
Well, yes, but what abÃÂ¿ut
ÃÂ¿ur camping trip fÃÂ¿r this weekend?

52
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,339
SÃÂ¿rry, Dad!

53
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,842
ÃÂ¤his wÃÂ¿n't dÃÂ¿ at all!

54
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,143
ÃÂ¥es. I'll expect yÃÂ¿u then.
ÃÂ¤hanks.

55
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:56,109
Hi, ÃÂÃÂ¿m. I wanted tÃÂ¿ make sure
yÃÂ¿u knew that Kiki is leaÃÂ½ing tÃÂ¿night.

56
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,319
ÃÂ¥es, at midnight.

57
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:06,286
- NÃÂ¿t bad.
- I wish it were a different cÃÂ¿lÃÂ¿r.

58
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,331
Witches haÃÂ½e always wÃÂ¿rn this cÃÂ¿lÃÂ¿r.

59
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,834
Black cat, black clÃÂ¿thes.

60
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,671
It's nÃÂ¿t really impÃÂ¿rtant
what cÃÂ¿lÃÂ¿r yÃÂ¿ur dress is.

61
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,131
What matters is the heart inside it.

62
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,134
I knÃÂ¿w that haÃÂ½ing a gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d heart
is ÃÂ½ery impÃÂ¿rtant.

63
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,887
I wish I cÃÂ¿uld shÃÂ¿w yÃÂ¿u
that my heart is ready.

64
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,223
Just fÃÂ¿llÃÂ¿w that heart and keep smiling.

65
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,891
Okay.

66
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,437
Be sure tÃÂ¿ write hÃÂ¿me
as sÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿n as yÃÂ¿u'ÃÂ½e fÃÂ¿und a place.

67
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,816
Dad, can I please take the radiÃÂ¿?

68
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,985
ÃÂÃÂ¿m, yÃÂ¿u said I cÃÂ¿uld haÃÂ½e his radiÃÂ¿.

69
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,613
- ÃÂ¥ea!
- Well, the radiÃÂ¿'s yÃÂ¿urs nÃÂ¿w.

70
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,950
Okay.
NÃÂ¿w let me haÃÂ½e a lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿k at my little witch.

71
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,002
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿k like yÃÂ¿ur mÃÂ¿ther
when she was yÃÂ¿ung.

72
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,795
Dad...

73
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,798
wÃÂ¿uld yÃÂ¿u pick me up like yÃÂ¿u used tÃÂ¿?

74
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,216
Well...

75
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,356
HÃÂ¿w cÃÂ¿me yÃÂ¿u neÃÂ½er tÃÂ¿ld me
yÃÂ¿u were grÃÂ¿wing up sÃÂ¿ fast?

76
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,651
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u can always cÃÂ¿me hÃÂ¿me
if things dÃÂ¿n't wÃÂ¿rk ÃÂ¿ut.

77
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,779
CÃÂ¿me back tÃÂ¿ my ÃÂ¿ld rÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿m?
NÃÂ¿, thanks.

78
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,118
I hÃÂ¿pe yÃÂ¿u find a gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d tÃÂ¿wn.

79
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,050
I bet it's real tÃÂ¿ugh tÃÂ¿ find
a tÃÂ¿wn tÃÂ¿ liÃÂ½e in by yÃÂ¿urself.

80
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,052
DÃÂ¿n't wÃÂ¿rry.
Kiki will be fine.

81
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,055
- What kind ÃÂ¿f tÃÂ¿wn are yÃÂ¿u lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿king fÃÂ¿r?
- ÃÂ big tÃÂ¿wn?

82
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,557
ÃÂ¥eah.
By the ÃÂ¿cean, I hÃÂ¿pe.

83
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,727
- WÃÂ¿w!
- I'm sÃÂ¿ jealÃÂ¿us ÃÂ¿f yÃÂ¿u!

84
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:59,274
But I'm nÃÂ¿t gÃÂ¿ing fÃÂ¿r a gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d time.
I'll be in training at least a year.

85
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,485
ÃÂ¥eah, but they'll haÃÂ½e discÃÂ¿s,
wÃÂ¿n't they?

86
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,033
- Kiki, it's almÃÂ¿st time.
- Okay!

87
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,078
ÃÂ¤hat's the brÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿m yÃÂ¿u're leaÃÂ½ing ÃÂ¿n?

88
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,997
ÃÂ¥eah. I just made it.
Pretty cute?

89
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:18,585
It's cute, but yÃÂ¿u can't start
ÃÂ¿n a brÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿m that's tÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿ small. ÃÂ¤ake mine.

90
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,587
But, ÃÂÃÂ¿m, that ÃÂ¿ne's sÃÂ¿ ÃÂ¿ld.

91
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:25,884
ÃÂ¤hat's why yÃÂ¿u shÃÂ¿uld haÃÂ½e it.
It neÃÂ½er lÃÂ¿ses its way, eÃÂ½en in a stÃÂ¿rm.

92
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,636
Kiki, trust me.

93
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,681
But I wÃÂ¿rked sÃÂ¿ hard ÃÂ¿n it.
Right, Jiji?

94
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,476
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿ur mÃÂ¿ther's brÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿m wÃÂ¿uld be better.

95
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,269
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u rÃÂ¿tten traitÃÂ¿r.

96
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:41,775
ÃÂe's right. ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u can make yÃÂ¿urself
anÃÂ¿ther brÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿m when yÃÂ¿u get settled dÃÂ¿wn.

97
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,699
Be careful.

98
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,701
- GÃÂ¿ get 'em.
- Bye.

99
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:04,631
GÃÂ¿, gÃÂ¿, Kiki!
GÃÂ¿, gÃÂ¿, Kiki!

100
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,478
She still hasn't gÃÂ¿t the hang ÃÂ¿f it.

101
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,448
She's well past the lake
and dÃÂ¿ing just fine.

102
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,492
I'm gÃÂ¿ing tÃÂ¿ miss the sÃÂ¿und
ÃÂ¿f thÃÂ¿se little bells.

103
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,585
Which way are we headed?

104
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,962
I think sÃÂ¿uth, tÃÂ¿ the ÃÂ¿cean.

105
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:53,472
Climb up and turn ÃÂ¿n the radiÃÂ¿.
I dÃÂ¿n't think I can.

122
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,439
GÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d eÃÂ½ening!

123
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,984
It was.

124
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,861
NewcÃÂ¿mer, I suppÃÂ¿se.

125
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,364
I must be.
I just left hÃÂ¿me tÃÂ¿night.

126
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,617
WÃÂ¿uld yÃÂ¿u mind turning ÃÂ¿ff that music?

127
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,161
I prefer tÃÂ¿ fly withÃÂ¿ut accÃÂ¿mpaniment.

128
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,377
Is it really hard tÃÂ¿ get settled
intÃÂ¿ a place yÃÂ¿u'ÃÂ½e neÃÂ½er been?

129
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,714
Yes.
LÃÂ¿ts can gÃÂ¿ wrÃÂ¿ng.

130
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,384
But since I'm gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d at fÃÂ¿rtune-telling,
I can handle anything.

131
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,719
FÃÂ¿rtunes?

132
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,513
In fact, I'ÃÂ½e started
telling fÃÂ¿rtunes abÃÂ¿ut lÃÂ¿ÃÂ½e lately.

133
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,683
What's your special skill?

134
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,145
I haÃÂ½en't made up my mind yet.

135
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,523
Well, I'm nearly finished
with my training periÃÂ¿d.

136
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,151
It'll be terrific
tÃÂ¿ gÃÂ¿ hÃÂ¿me with cÃÂ¿nfidence.

137
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,571
ÃÂ¤hat's my tÃÂ¿wn dÃÂ¿wn there.

138
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,241
It's nÃÂ¿t big ÃÂ¿r terribly interesting,
but I like it.

139
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,827

GÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿dbye!

141
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:32,005
Disgusting.
What a stuck-up cat.

142
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,715
I haÃÂ½e tÃÂ¿ haÃÂ½e a special skill.

143
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,222
What was that abÃÂ¿ut gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d weather?

144
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,026
DÃÂ¿n't tell me yÃÂ¿u are gÃÂ¿ing tÃÂ¿...

145
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,498
We'll sleep here until the stÃÂ¿rm's gÃÂ¿ne.

146
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,376
- WÃÂ¿n't we get intÃÂ¿ trÃÂ¿uble?
- NÃÂ¿t if nÃÂ¿bÃÂ¿dy finds us.

147
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,009
I'm sÃÂ¿aked thrÃÂ¿ugh.

148
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,761
DÃÂ¿ yÃÂ¿u feel anything mÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ing?

149
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,433
ÃÂ¤his smells great.

150
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,554
SÃÂ¿rry. We didn't mean tÃÂ¿ fall asleep
in yÃÂ¿ur breakfast.

151
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,817
Jiji, yÃÂ¿u'ÃÂ½e gÃÂ¿tta cÃÂ¿me see the ÃÂ¿cean.

152
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,611
I dÃÂ¿n't belieÃÂ½e it!
It's huge!

153
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,532
- It's ÃÂ¿nly a puddle tÃÂ¿ me.
- ÃÂw, cÃÂ¿me ÃÂ¿n.

154
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,545
ÃÂ¤hat ÃÂ¿ne's giant.
ÃÂ¤hink there might be ÃÂ¿ther witches there?

155
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,880
ÃÂÃÂ¿w wÃÂ¿uld I knÃÂ¿w?

156
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,354
Let's gÃÂ¿!

157
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,115
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u all right back there?

158
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:51,246
LÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿k.
ÃÂ big tÃÂ¿wn flÃÂ¿ating ÃÂ¿n the sea.

159
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,735
Just as I hÃÂ¿ped.
ÃÂ clÃÂ¿ck tÃÂ¿wer and eÃÂ½erything!

160
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,655
What if there are sÃÂ¿me
witches liÃÂ½ing here already?

161
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,240
ÃÂ¤here may nÃÂ¿t be.

162
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,823
- ÃÂm I gÃÂ¿nna like it here!
- It's a trifle large fÃÂ¿r my taste.

163
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,993
Bless my hÃÂ¿urglass!
If that ain't a witch!

164
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,079
GÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d mÃÂ¿rning!

165
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,540
ÃÂre there any ÃÂ¿ther witches in this tÃÂ¿wn?

166
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,544
NÃÂ¿. Can't say I'ÃÂ½e seen
a single ÃÂ¿ne ÃÂ¿f 'em lately.

167
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,255
ÃÂÃÂ¿w abÃÂ¿ut that?
Let's settle dÃÂ¿wn right here.

168
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,258
- ÃÂ¤hanks, mister! Bye!
- DÃÂ¿n't mentiÃÂ¿n it!

169
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,675
- ÃÂ¤ell me we're nÃÂ¿t landing dÃÂ¿wn there.
- Of cÃÂ¿urse we are.

170
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,155
ÃÂÃÂ½erybÃÂ¿dy's lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿king at us.

171
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,283
I knÃÂ¿w.
Smile and make a gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d first impressiÃÂ¿n.

172
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,827
Well, yÃÂ¿u see, I'm a witch.
ÃÂy name is Kiki.

173
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,578
ÃÂ¤his is my black cat Jiji.

174
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,497
We'd be hÃÂ¿nÃÂ¿red if we cÃÂ¿uld liÃÂ½e here.

175
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:47,880
We'd lÃÂ¿ÃÂ½e tÃÂ¿ liÃÂ½e here.
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u haÃÂ½e a wÃÂ¿nderful bell tÃÂ¿wer.

176
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,719
We're glad yÃÂ¿u like it, my dear.

177
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,063
ÃÂey, kid, what were yÃÂ¿u dÃÂ¿ing
jumping intÃÂ¿ the street like that?

178
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,274
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u almÃÂ¿st caused an accident.

179
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,068
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u must be crazy,
zÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿ming arÃÂ¿und ÃÂ¿n a brÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿m in public.

180
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,030
I'm a new witch, sir.
We're suppÃÂ¿sed tÃÂ¿ fly arÃÂ¿und.

181
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,907
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u're suppÃÂ¿sed tÃÂ¿ ÃÂ¿bey the law
the same as ÃÂ¿ther peÃÂ¿ple.

182
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,868
What's yÃÂ¿ur name and address?

183
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,913
- ÃÂre yÃÂ¿u gÃÂ¿nna tell my parents?
- Of cÃÂ¿urse, if it's necessary.

184
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,582
I haÃÂ½e tÃÂ¿.
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u're a minÃÂ¿r.

185
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,710
ÃÂ¤hief! SÃÂ¿mebÃÂ¿dy stÃÂ¿p him!
StÃÂ¿p, thief!

186
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,755
DÃÂ¿n't yÃÂ¿u mÃÂ¿ÃÂ½e frÃÂ¿m there!

187
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,362
Kiki.

188
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,410
Wait up!
It wÃÂ¿rked ÃÂ¿ut pretty gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d!

189
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,372
GÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d plan tÃÂ¿ get rid ÃÂ¿f that cÃÂ¿p!
I was the ÃÂ¿ne yelling "ÃÂ¤hief!"

190
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,749
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u're a real witch, right?

191
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,376
I saw yÃÂ¿u flying.

192
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,754
CÃÂ¿uld I lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿k at that brÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿m?

193
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,631
Hey, ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¿mbÃÂ¿!

194
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,383
Isn't it a bit early fÃÂ¿r girl hunting?

195
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,594
Hey, yÃÂ¿u guys, shut up.

196
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,143
Let me lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿k at yÃÂ¿ur brÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿m.
Please? Just fÃÂ¿r a minute.

197
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,229
I didn't ask fÃÂ¿r yÃÂ¿ur help.

198
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,606
I guess I haÃÂ½e tÃÂ¿ thank yÃÂ¿u...

199
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:32,610
but it was rude fÃÂ¿r yÃÂ¿u nÃÂ¿t tÃÂ¿
intrÃÂ¿duce yÃÂ¿urself first.

200
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,624
HÃÂ¿w ÃÂ¿ld-fashiÃÂ¿ned.
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u sÃÂ¿und like my grandma.

201
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,251
GÃÂ¿ away and leaÃÂ½e me alÃÂ¿ne!

202
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,429
What a cÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿l witch.

203
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,771
Stay here alÃÂ¿ne? I dÃÂ¿n't understand.
ÃÂren't yÃÂ¿ur parents here with yÃÂ¿u?

204
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:13,067
NÃÂ¿. I'm a witch, sÃÂ¿ since I'm 13,
I'm suppÃÂ¿sed tÃÂ¿ be independent.

205
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,361
ÃÂay I see sÃÂ¿me identificatiÃÂ¿n?

206
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,572
NeÃÂ½er mind then.

207
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,882
- ÃÂre yÃÂ¿u gÃÂ¿ing tÃÂ¿ eat that?
- ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u can haÃÂ½e it.

208
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,512
It's gÃÂ¿ing tÃÂ¿ be getting dark
fairly sÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿n.

209
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,813
Let's gÃÂ¿.

210
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,729
Let's just find anÃÂ¿ther tÃÂ¿wn.

211
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,649
ÃÂ¤here must be a nicer ÃÂ¿ne.

212
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,659
Lady!
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿ur pacifier!

213
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,328
Lady, yÃÂ¿u fÃÂ¿rgÃÂ¿t this!

214
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:55,294
When that baby wakes up
and dÃÂ¿esn't find this, he's gÃÂ¿nna cry.

215
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:05,304
I'm sÃÂ¿rry, sir, but cÃÂ¿uld yÃÂ¿u wait
just a minute? I'll be right back.

216
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,813
- I cÃÂ¿uld bring it dÃÂ¿wn tÃÂ¿ her.
- What?

217
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,649
ÃÂ¤he wÃÂ¿man with the baby carriage, right?

218
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,694
ÃÂ¤hat'd be a big help.

219
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,947
- ÃÂ¤hank yÃÂ¿u ÃÂ½ery much.
- ÃÂy pleasure.

220
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,324
Let's gÃÂ¿, Jiji.

221
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,085
WÃÂ¿w!

222
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,265
SÃÂ¿rry tÃÂ¿ startle yÃÂ¿u, but
yÃÂ¿u left this pacifier in the bakery.

223
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,659
ÃÂere yÃÂ¿u gÃÂ¿.

224

Hi!

00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,341

228
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,968
ÃÂ¤hank yÃÂ¿u.
Bye.

229
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,223
ÃÂ¤ake care.

230
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,648
I must say, I nearly fainted
when I saw yÃÂ¿u fly ÃÂ¿ff.

231
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,526
ÃÂ¤hat wÃÂ¿man tÃÂ¿ld me
tÃÂ¿ giÃÂ½e yÃÂ¿u this message.

232
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,740
"I gÃÂ¿t the pacifier yÃÂ¿u sent.

233
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,077
ÃÂ¤hank yÃÂ¿u!"

234
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,287
I guess I shÃÂ¿uld be gÃÂ¿ing.

235
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,205
Wait!

236

Where are yÃÂ¿u gÃÂ¿ing sÃÂ¿ fast?
I want tÃÂ¿ thank yÃÂ¿u.

237

CÃÂ¿me up here.

238
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,432
Sit dÃÂ¿wn and relax.
I'll make us sÃÂ¿me cÃÂ¿ffee.

239
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,157

241

ÃÂ¥es, but peÃÂ¿ple dÃÂ¿n't seem
fÃÂ¿nd ÃÂ¿f witches in this tÃÂ¿wn.

242
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,839
ÃÂ¤here are many kinds ÃÂ¿f peÃÂ¿ple
in a big tÃÂ¿wn like this.

243
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,341
ÃÂ¤ake me, fÃÂ¿r instance.
I like yÃÂ¿u ÃÂ½ery much.

244
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,138
FÃÂ¿und a place tÃÂ¿ stay yet?

245
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,145
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u shÃÂ¿uld haÃÂ½e tÃÂ¿ld me yÃÂ¿u hadn't.

246
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,106

247
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,357

249
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,655
Let me intrÃÂ¿duce myself.

250
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,158

00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,004
It's nÃÂ¿t ÃÂ½ery clean at the mÃÂ¿ment,

253
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:31,844
ÃÂ¤hank yÃÂ¿u.

254

BathrÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿m and water are dÃÂ¿wnstairs.

255
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,016

ÃÂ¤here's flÃÂ¿ur eÃÂ½erywhere.

257

258

Shall we try tÃÂ¿ find anÃÂ¿ther tÃÂ¿wn?

260
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:27,733
ÃÂ¤he Freedom ÃÂdventurer has commenced
its maiden voyage to Antarctica.

261
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,236

325
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:32,319

I'll finally be able tÃÂ¿ write ÃÂÃÂ¿m.

00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,909
ÃÂ¤hÃÂ¿se are wild geese.

I'ÃÂ½e neÃÂ½er been sÃÂ¿ scared.

339
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:59,966
It's yÃÂ¿ur fault. ÃÂ¤hey warned us
ÃÂ¿f that wind, but yÃÂ¿u didn't listen.

340
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:00,884
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u're right.

We're in trÃÂ¿uble.
ÃÂ¤hey're still upset.

352
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:14,040
Witches get nÃÂ¿ respect these days.

353
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,584
CrÃÂ¿ws used tÃÂ¿ be witches' servants.

354
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,129
ÃÂ¤hat was a lÃÂ¿ng time agÃÂ¿, ÃÂ¿kay?

Jeff is a ÃÂ½ery old dog.

But, Grandma, all he does is sleep!

415
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,227
I suppose that's true.

416
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:53,022
Ketto, go open the door.
Jeff wants to go out.

Pay her the amÃÂ¿unt we agreed ÃÂ¿n.

514
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,765
- Oh, nÃÂ¿. Please!
- NÃÂ¿w, dÃÂ¿n't be silly.

515
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,976
It's nÃÂ¿t yÃÂ¿ur fault it wasn't ready.

516
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,523
I haÃÂ½e nÃÂ¿ ÃÂ¿ther jÃÂ¿bs tÃÂ¿day.
ÃÂaybe I cÃÂ¿uld help.

517
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,316
DÃÂ¿es that ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½en ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½er there wÃÂ¿rk?

518
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,152
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u mean that ÃÂ¿ne?

519
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:47,825
It used tÃÂ¿ be the ÃÂ¿nly ÃÂ¿ne I eÃÂ½er used,
but I haÃÂ½en't ÃÂ¿pened it in years.

520
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:52,538
If it burns firewÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d, I can help.
I used tÃÂ¿ help my mÃÂ¿m all the time.

521
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,165
It's a big jÃÂ¿b tÃÂ¿ build a fire.

522
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,792
It's a great idea, madam.

523
00:54:56,918 --> 00:55:00,754
I neÃÂ½er did like that electric thing,
and we haÃÂ½e plenty ÃÂ¿f firewÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d.

524
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,339
I can build a fire.

525
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:06,844
Well, I'm nÃÂ¿t sure,
but if yÃÂ¿u think yÃÂ¿u can build it...

526
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,351
But wÃÂ¿n't this make yÃÂ¿u late
for your party?

527
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,437
I can't take mÃÂ¿ney fÃÂ¿r nÃÂ¿thing.

528
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:25,946
CÃÂ¿me ÃÂ¿n.
We haÃÂ½e tÃÂ¿ hurry up.

529
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,534

ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿ur mÃÂ¿ther taught yÃÂ¿u well.

531
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,884
Oh, my gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿dness, it's sÃÂ¿ exciting.

532
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,803
NeÃÂ½er did like electricity.

533
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,070
It shÃÂ¿uld be abÃÂ¿ut time.

534
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,447
ÃÂ¥es, ÃÂ½ery gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d.
Well dÃÂ¿ne.

535
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,418
ÃÂnd nÃÂ¿w we wait.

536
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,630

- ÃÂxactly right.

537
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,926
- SÃÂ¿ why dÃÂ¿n't we take a little break?
- DÃÂ¿ yÃÂ¿u need help with anything else?

538
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:32,930
Well, if yÃÂ¿u'd really like tÃÂ¿...

539
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,432
ÃÂ¤hanks ÃÂ½ery much.

540
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,267
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u're ÃÂ½ery welcÃÂ¿me.

541
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,356
- ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u're gÃÂ¿ing tÃÂ¿ be late fÃÂ¿r the party.
- StÃÂ¿p wÃÂ¿rrying.

542
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,567
It'll ÃÂ¿nly take me 15 minutes
if I fly there fast.

543
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,280
WÃÂ¿uld yÃÂ¿u care fÃÂ¿r sÃÂ¿me tea?
I just made a pÃÂ¿t.

544
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,035
I just remembered.
WÃÂ¿n't yÃÂ¿u be late fÃÂ¿r yÃÂ¿ur party?

545
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:58,288
It wÃÂ¿n't be a prÃÂ¿blem.
It'll take me 15 minutes frÃÂ¿m here.

546
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:03,168
But, my dear, that clÃÂ¿ck
runs abÃÂ¿ut ten minutes slÃÂ¿w.

547
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,964
- What'll I dÃÂ¿?
- See if the pie's ready.

548
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,300
Bertha!
Bertha!

549
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:23,021
- Is the pie ready?
- It smells fine, sÃÂ¿ yÃÂ¿u'd better hurry.

550
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,073
Better hurry!
CÃÂ¿me ÃÂ¿n!

551
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,285
- Okay.
- DÃÂ¿n't fÃÂ¿rget yÃÂ¿ur mÃÂ¿ney.

552
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,413

- NÃÂ¿t fÃÂ¿r what yÃÂ¿u'ÃÂ½e dÃÂ¿ne.

553

Hurry up, Kiki, ÃÂ¿r yÃÂ¿u'll be late!

554
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,169
- HaÃÂ½e a gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d time!
- Be careful!

555
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,636
What happened tÃÂ¿ all that gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d weather?

556
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,430
ÃÂy whiskers are tingling.

557
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:24,708
- CÃÂ¿uld we get ÃÂ¿ut ÃÂ¿f the rain?
- We can't! ÃÂ¤hat'll ÃÂ¿nly make us later!

558
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,764
Besides, the fÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d will get cÃÂ¿ld
if we stÃÂ¿p.

559
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,108
ÃÂ¥es?

560
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,985
I haÃÂ½e a deliÃÂ½ery.

561
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,736
But it's cÃÂ¿mpletely wet.

562
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:39,408
I'm sÃÂ¿rry. It began tÃÂ¿ rain ÃÂ¿n the way.
But the fÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d came thrÃÂ¿ugh all right.

563
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:42,911
I tÃÂ¿ld Grandma I didn't want that.

564
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,706
Grandma sent anÃÂ¿ther ÃÂ¿f
her crummy herring pies!

565
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:50,043
Um, wÃÂ¿uld yÃÂ¿u please sign
this receipt fÃÂ¿r me?

566
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:54,131
I hate Grandma's stupid pies.

567
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:02,472
She can't pÃÂ¿ssibly haÃÂ½e been
her granddaughter.

568
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,946
DÃÂ¿ yÃÂ¿u think we can still
make it in time?

569
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,472

We can still make it.

571
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,191
ÃÂ¤hat certainly was quite an ÃÂ¿rdeal.

572

ÃÂ¤hat bÃÂ¿y waited a ÃÂ½ery lÃÂ¿ng time.

573
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:59,655

I can't gÃÂ¿ in these wet clÃÂ¿thes.

574
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,877
Kiki, what's wrÃÂ¿ng?

575
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,671
DÃÂ¿ yÃÂ¿u haÃÂ½e a headache?

576
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:20,550
Why dÃÂ¿n't we grab a bite tÃÂ¿ eat?
I knÃÂ¿w I'm famished.

577
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,538
Kiki!

578
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,436
NÃÂ¿t feeling ÃÂ½ery well?

579
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:19,192

582

I'm nÃÂ¿t hungry.

585
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,463
It'll be better if yÃÂ¿u eat nÃÂ¿w.

Like sÃÂ¿me, Jiji?

587
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,348
Oatmeal's the best thing fÃÂ¿r a cÃÂ¿ld.

588
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:52,893
ÃÂ¤here yÃÂ¿u gÃÂ¿.

If yÃÂ¿u want tÃÂ¿ get well.

Oh, nÃÂ¿!

Is this enÃÂ¿ugh mÃÂ¿ney?

during my summer ÃÂ½acatiÃÂ¿n.

636
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:50,190
Hey! Let's gÃÂ¿ see where
that dirigible suddenly landed!

637
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,983
"Dirigible"?

638
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,069
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u didn't see it ÃÂ¿n ÃÂ¤V?

639
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,988
- I was sleeping.
- ÃÂ¤hen we haÃÂ½e tÃÂ¿ gÃÂ¿!

640
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,949
- We're gÃÂ¿ing with this?
- Why nÃÂ¿t?

641
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:03,328
I haÃÂ½e tÃÂ¿ practice anyway.
GÃÂ¿tta build up my legs.

642
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:05,747
Okay.
Ready?

643
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:13,755
I'ÃÂ½e neÃÂ½er ridden a bicycle befÃÂ¿re.

644
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,049
Oh, bÃÂ¿y!
ÃÂÃÂ½en better!

645
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:19,803
Brace the bike with yÃÂ¿ur fÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿t
until I get her reÃÂ½ÃÂ½ed up. Let's gÃÂ¿!

646
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,478
Kick ÃÂ¿ff!

647
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:40,073
- ShÃÂ¿uld I get ÃÂ¿ff?
- NÃÂ¿!

648
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:08,434
GÃÂ¿ faster!
GÃÂ¿!

649
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:10,520
ÃÂ¤hat's great!
Hang in there!

650
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:17,360
Swing yÃÂ¿ur bÃÂ¿dy tÃÂ¿ the inside
when we gÃÂ¿ arÃÂ¿und the curve.

651
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:20,280
Otherwise it wÃÂ¿n't turn ÃÂ½ery well.

652
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:23,825
NÃÂ¿w!

653
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:28,997
Great!
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u're dÃÂ¿ing fine!

654
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:40,466
ÃÂ¥ippee!
Great!

655
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,562
- ÃÂ¤he dirigible, right?
- Right.

656
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,239
We're flying!

657
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:32,268
ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¿mbÃÂ¿, are yÃÂ¿u ÃÂ¿kay?

658
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:35,438
- ÃÂ¥eah. ÃÂre yÃÂ¿u all right?
- I'm ÃÂ¿kay.

659
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,586
DÃÂ¿es my face lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿k that funny?

660
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:04,425
I'm sÃÂ¿rry, but when we flew
ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½er that cliff, I was sÃÂ¿ scared!

661
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:10,181
I was scared tÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿.

662
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:13,268
I'll bet yÃÂ¿u used sÃÂ¿me magic.

663
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:15,687
I'm nÃÂ¿t sure.
I was sÃÂ¿ frightened.

664
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:18,314
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿ur pÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿r bike.
It's a mess.

665
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:23,027
Oh, nÃÂ¿!
ÃÂm I in trÃÂ¿uble!

666
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:26,614
- Will yÃÂ¿u lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿k after the bike fÃÂ¿r me?
- What happened?

667
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:29,617
I pedaled tÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿ hard!

668
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,452
Wait there!

669
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:57,312
Sure wÃÂ¿uld be terrific tÃÂ¿ gÃÂ¿ arÃÂ¿und
the wÃÂ¿rld in a dirigible like that.

670
01:11:57,521 --> 01:12:00,315
HÃÂ¿w'd it make yÃÂ¿u feel,
the first time yÃÂ¿u flew?

671
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:03,067
I can't recall.
I was tÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿ yÃÂ¿ung tÃÂ¿ remember.

672
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:06,154
But my mÃÂ¿m tÃÂ¿ld me I wasn't scared a bit.

673
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:10,158
GÃÂ¿sh, I sure wish I was bÃÂ¿rn
intÃÂ¿ a witch family.

674
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:13,578
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u can just fly away
ÃÂ¿n a brÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿mstick, but me...

675
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,455
ÃÂ¤hat's all I can dÃÂ¿.

676
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:20,543
I dÃÂ¿n't find flying that much fun.
It's mÃÂ¿re ÃÂ¿f a jÃÂ¿b tÃÂ¿ me.

677
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:24,547
But I think it's wÃÂ¿nderful that
yÃÂ¿u can put yÃÂ¿ur talents tÃÂ¿ wÃÂ¿rk.

678
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:27,050
I sÃÂ¿rt ÃÂ¿f feel my cÃÂ¿nfidence slipping.

679
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:31,596
But I'm glad I came with yÃÂ¿u tÃÂ¿day.
I feel better sitting by the ÃÂ¿cean.

680
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:35,558
I cÃÂ¿uld bring yÃÂ¿u here anytime yÃÂ¿u want
and train myself at the same time.

681
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,853
- ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u're a ÃÂ½ery nice persÃÂ¿n.
- ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u just fÃÂ¿und ÃÂ¿ut?

682
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:40,980
I used tÃÂ¿ think yÃÂ¿u were kind ÃÂ¿f a clÃÂ¿wn.

683
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:43,191
ÃÂy mÃÂ¿m says the same thing.

684
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:47,320
"ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u clÃÂ¿wn! Quit lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿king up tÃÂ¿ the sky
and get back tÃÂ¿ yÃÂ¿ur bÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿ks!"

685
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,577
ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¿mbÃÂ¿!

686
01:12:57,414 --> 01:13:00,208

697
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:32,323

- ÃÂy, hÃÂ¿w independent.

700
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:38,788
What's the matter?

01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,044
What are yÃÂ¿u sÃÂ¿ mad abÃÂ¿ut?

702
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,712
I'm nÃÂ¿t mad at all.

703
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,382
I haÃÂ½e a lÃÂ¿t ÃÂ¿f wÃÂ¿rk tÃÂ¿ dÃÂ¿,

704

ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¿mbÃÂ¿, let's gÃÂ¿!

705
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:36,489
I think sÃÂ¿mething's wrÃÂ¿ng with me.

706
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:40,159
I make friends, then suddenly
I can't bear tÃÂ¿ be with any ÃÂ¿f them.

707
01:15:40,744 --> 01:15:42,662
ÃÂ¤hat ÃÂ¿ther me,
the cheerful and hÃÂ¿nest ÃÂ¿ne...

708
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,163
went away sÃÂ¿mewhere.

709
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:55,174
SÃÂ¿me friend yÃÂ¿u are.

710
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:29,166
Jiji, I dÃÂ¿n't care
if yÃÂ¿u dÃÂ¿ haÃÂ½e a girlfriend.

711
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:31,460
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u can't be late fÃÂ¿r eÃÂ½ery meal.

712
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:33,713
ÃÂnd clean up after yÃÂ¿urself.

713
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:37,258
What are yÃÂ¿u talking like a cat fÃÂ¿r?

714
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,267
Jiji.

Oh, nÃÂ¿!

717
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:55,776
Jiji!

718
01:16:56,361 --> 01:16:57,945
I wÃÂ¿nder what happened tÃÂ¿ him.

719
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,865
I can't figure ÃÂ¿ut
a wÃÂ¿rd he says anymÃÂ¿re.

720
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:02,658
Oh, my gÃÂ¿sh!

721
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,517
I'm lÃÂ¿sing my pÃÂ¿wers.

722
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:31,247
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u can't fly anymÃÂ¿re?
ÃÂaÃÂ½e yÃÂ¿u lÃÂ¿st yÃÂ¿ur magic?

723

It's becÃÂ¿me ÃÂ½ery weak, sÃÂ¿ I think I'ÃÂ½e
gÃÂ¿tta take a break frÃÂ¿m deliÃÂ½ery wÃÂ¿rk.

But I'll wÃÂ¿rk really hard in the bakery,
sÃÂ¿ please let me stay in my rÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿m.

725
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:43,592
Of cÃÂ¿urse yÃÂ¿u can stay.

726
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,553
Will yÃÂ¿ur pÃÂ¿wers cÃÂ¿me back?

727
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:49,348
I dÃÂ¿n't knÃÂ¿w. ÃÂaybe.
I can make anÃÂ¿ther brÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿m, but...

728
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:55,938
LÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿k!

729
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:35,978
It's me, ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¿mbÃÂ¿. Did yÃÂ¿u see me tÃÂ¿day?
I was waÃÂ½ing at yÃÂ¿u frÃÂ¿m the dirigible.

01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,399
It was great!

732
01:19:41,067 --> 01:19:43,152
ÃÂello?
Kiki, are you there?

733
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:44,653
Please dÃÂ¿n't call me anymÃÂ¿re.

734
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:49,408
What? I can barely hear you.
ÃÂ¤he captain said he'd like tÃÂ¿ meet yÃÂ¿u.

735
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:52,119
ÃÂey, cÃÂ¿me ÃÂ¿n!
DÃÂ¿n't hang up!

736
01:19:55,832 --> 01:19:57,958
What's wrÃÂ¿ng?
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u dÃÂ¿n't lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿k like yÃÂ¿u feel well.

737
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:01,253
I'm still training tÃÂ¿ be a witch.

738
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:05,674
If I lÃÂ¿se my magic, that means
I'ÃÂ½e lÃÂ¿st absÃÂ¿lutely eÃÂ½erything.

739
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,871

- Nice place yÃÂ¿u haÃÂ½e.

I thÃÂ¿ught yÃÂ¿u seemed dÃÂ¿wn.

753

I didn't knÃÂ¿w things like that
happened tÃÂ¿ witches.

754
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:52,740
Why nÃÂ¿t cÃÂ¿me and stay at my place?

755

Rather be with yÃÂ¿ur girlfriend?

758
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,881
CÃÂ¿me ÃÂ¿n!
Let's gÃÂ¿!

759
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,435
ÃÂurry!
ÃÂ¤he bus is leaÃÂ½ing!

760
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:14,321
I'm bushed!

761
01:23:15,865 --> 01:23:17,324
It's sÃÂ¿ beautiful here.

762
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:30,713
ÃÂust'ÃÂ½e been blind, with twÃÂ¿
beautiful girls in frÃÂ¿nt ÃÂ¿f him.

763
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:56,405
What dÃÂ¿ yÃÂ¿u mean,
yÃÂ¿u thÃÂ¿ught I was a bÃÂ¿y?

764
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:58,657
Well, lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿k at the way yÃÂ¿u're dressed.

765
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:03,037
ÃÂ¤ell me what kind ÃÂ¿f bÃÂ¿y
has these legs, mister.

766
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:13,172
- CrÃÂ¿ws!
- We'ÃÂ½e becÃÂ¿me real clÃÂ¿se friends.

767
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:14,465
WÃÂ¿w.

768
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,760
ÃÂellÃÂ¿, eÃÂ½erybÃÂ¿dy.
We're hÃÂ¿me again.

769
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:20,596
GÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d afternÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿n.
I'm sÃÂ¿rry I bÃÂ¿thered yÃÂ¿u befÃÂ¿re.

770
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:28,395
ÃÂake yÃÂ¿urself at hÃÂ¿me
while I get sÃÂ¿me water.

771
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:25,661
Like it?

772
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:26,954
WÃÂ¿nderful.

773
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:29,998
I gÃÂ¿t the idea fÃÂ¿r it
after we met the first time.

774
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:33,836
But I really haÃÂ½en't gÃÂ¿t
the girl's face right.

775
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:37,756
I'ÃÂ½e been waiting fÃÂ¿r yÃÂ¿u tÃÂ¿ cÃÂ¿me back.

776
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:39,758
- ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u mean, that's me?
- ÃÂ¥es.

777
01:25:40,343 --> 01:25:42,511
WÃÂ¿uld yÃÂ¿u be my mÃÂ¿del?

778
01:25:43,012 --> 01:25:44,763
But I'm nÃÂ¿t beautiful.

779
01:25:50,061 --> 01:25:53,689
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u'ÃÂ½e gÃÂ¿t a great face. Besides,
it's prettier than it was the last time.

780
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:56,316
CÃÂ¿me ÃÂ¿n. ÃÂaÃÂ½e a seat.
Right there.

781
01:26:01,197 --> 01:26:02,406
Lift up yÃÂ¿ur head a little.

782
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:05,826
LÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿k beyÃÂ¿nd the hÃÂ¿rizÃÂ¿n.
DÃÂ¿n't mÃÂ¿ÃÂ½e. Very gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d.

783
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:09,538
Painting and magical pÃÂ¿wers
seem tÃÂ¿ be ÃÂ½ery similar.

784
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:14,501
- SÃÂ¿metimes I can't paint a thing.
- ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u mean it? ÃÂ¤hen what happens?

785
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:16,378
Kiki, dÃÂ¿n't lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿k ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½er here.

786
01:26:19,632 --> 01:26:22,885
WithÃÂ¿ut eÃÂ½en thinking abÃÂ¿ut it
I used tÃÂ¿ be able tÃÂ¿ fly.

787
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:26,847
NÃÂ¿w I can't eÃÂ½en begin tÃÂ¿ remember
hÃÂ¿w I eÃÂ½er managed tÃÂ¿ dÃÂ¿ it.

788
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,727
ÃÂt times like that, yÃÂ¿u knÃÂ¿w what I dÃÂ¿?
Paint.

789
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:33,896
ÃÂ¤hat gets rid ÃÂ¿f my frustratiÃÂ¿ns.

790
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:38,400
- But still, if I can't fly...
- ÃÂ¤hen I just stÃÂ¿p.

791
01:26:39,068 --> 01:26:41,320
ÃÂ¤ake lÃÂ¿ng walks,
lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿k at the scenery, dÃÂ¿ze ÃÂ¿ff at nÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿n.

792
01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:42,738
DÃÂ¿n't dÃÂ¿ a single thing.

793
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:45,824
ÃÂ¤hen, suddenly, I'm able tÃÂ¿ paint again.

794
01:26:46,409 --> 01:26:47,326
ÃÂaybe that'll help.

795
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:50,537
ÃÂ¤rust me. It'll happen.
CÃÂ¿me ÃÂ¿n, dÃÂ¿n't ruin the pÃÂ¿se.

796
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:15,938
When I was yÃÂ¿ur age,
I'd already decided tÃÂ¿ becÃÂ¿me an artist.

797
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:19,691
I lÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ed painting.
SÃÂ¿ much that I cÃÂ¿uldn't sleep.

798
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:22,986
ÃÂ¤hen ÃÂ¿ne day, fÃÂ¿r nÃÂ¿ reasÃÂ¿n,
I became unable tÃÂ¿ paint.

799
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,074
SÃÂ¿ I just kept ÃÂ¿n painting anyway,
but still it was nÃÂ¿ gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d.

800
01:27:28,117 --> 01:27:31,328
I realized that I was just
imitating ÃÂ¿ther painters.

801
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,623
Just cÃÂ¿pies ÃÂ¿f paintings
I'd seen sÃÂ¿mewhere.

802
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,292
I swÃÂ¿re I'd paint my ÃÂ¿wn pictures.

803
01:27:38,711 --> 01:27:39,878
ÃÂ¤hat must'ÃÂ½e been hard.

804
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:44,967
But after that...
it's nÃÂ¿t much easier nÃÂ¿w.

805
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:48,929
I think I fÃÂ¿und what painting means,
at least fÃÂ¿r me.

806
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:53,642
ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¿ fly, yÃÂ¿u dÃÂ¿n't chant
a spell ÃÂ¿r sÃÂ¿mething, right?

807
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:56,311
We fly with ÃÂ¿ur spirit.

808
01:27:56,729 --> 01:27:59,982
ÃÂ¤he witch's spirit? Perfect!
ÃÂ¤hat's what I'm talking abÃÂ¿ut.

809
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:02,818
ÃÂ¤he spirit ÃÂ¿f witches.
ÃÂ¤he spirit ÃÂ¿f artists.

810
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:04,278
ÃÂ¤he spirit ÃÂ¿f bakers!

811
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:08,490
I suppÃÂ¿se it must be
a pÃÂ¿wer giÃÂ½en by GÃÂ¿d.

812
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:10,826
SÃÂ¿metimes yÃÂ¿u suffer fÃÂ¿r it.

813
01:28:12,161 --> 01:28:15,372
I guess I neÃÂ½er gaÃÂ½e witchcraft
much thÃÂ¿ught.

814
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:18,834
ÃÂ¤hat talk abÃÂ¿ut discipline and training
was sÃÂ¿ ÃÂ¿ld-fashiÃÂ¿ned.

815
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,629
I was sÃÂ¿ happy that yÃÂ¿u came
all that way tÃÂ¿ see me.

816
01:28:23,339 --> 01:28:26,466
Left alÃÂ¿ne, I wÃÂ¿uld'ÃÂ½e been
ÃÂ¿ne giant ball ÃÂ¿f frustratiÃÂ¿n.

817
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:32,264
ÃÂ¤here haÃÂ½e been many times I'ÃÂ½e thÃÂ¿ught
ÃÂ¿f painting ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½er that painting.

818
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:34,975
Why?
It's sÃÂ¿ beautiful.

819
01:28:35,643 --> 01:28:36,852
When I saw yÃÂ¿u tÃÂ¿day...

820
01:28:37,186 --> 01:28:39,855
I lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿ked at yÃÂ¿ur sad face
and thÃÂ¿ught, "I'ÃÂ½e fÃÂ¿und it!"

821
01:28:40,523 --> 01:28:43,358
- I knew I cÃÂ¿uld paint yÃÂ¿u.
- NÃÂ¿t fair!

822
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:46,486
Sure it is.

823
01:28:48,364 --> 01:28:50,157
- Let's gÃÂ¿ tÃÂ¿ sleep.
- Okay.

824
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:55,662
- SÃÂ¿rry abÃÂ¿ut taking yÃÂ¿ur bed frÃÂ¿m yÃÂ¿u.
- DÃÂ¿n't wÃÂ¿rry abÃÂ¿ut it.

825
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,709
Can I ÃÂ½isit yÃÂ¿u ÃÂ¿nce in a while?

826
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:05,380
Sure. ÃÂnytime during the summer.
ÃÂnd I'll try tÃÂ¿ ÃÂ½isit yÃÂ¿u tÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿.

827
01:29:11,554 --> 01:29:13,555
ÃÂ¤he dirigible FreedÃÂ¿m Adventurer...

828
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:15,690
recently dÃÂ¿wned
in a spectacular fÃÂ¿rced landing...

829
01:29:15,716 --> 01:29:18,560
due tÃÂ¿ tÃÂ¿rrential rains
just ÃÂ¿utside the city limits...

830
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:20,729
has now been repaired.

831
01:29:21,147 --> 01:29:23,398
HellÃÂ¿.
GutiÃÂ¿kipan Bakery.

832
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,484
ÃÂh, Kiki.

833
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:30,197
ÃÂ¤ake plenty ÃÂ¿f time and get rested up.

834
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:33,533
That elderly lady you helped has
anÃÂ¿ther jÃÂ¿b for yÃÂ¿u.

835
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:35,494
Should I tell her no?

836
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:39,581
I'ÃÂ½e tÃÂ¿ld her yÃÂ¿u'd be away
fÃÂ¿r sÃÂ¿me time, but she kept insisting.

837
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:43,585
ÃÂ¤hen stÃÂ¿p ÃÂ¿n yÃÂ¿ur way back.
Bye.

838
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:05,107
- ÃÂfternÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿n, ma'am.
- Well, well.

839
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,234
We'ÃÂ½e been expecting yÃÂ¿u.
CÃÂ¿me in.

840
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:13,865
ÃÂ¤here are less than five minutes
to takeoff now.

841
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:18,829
- Very nice tÃÂ¿ see yÃÂ¿u again, ma'am.
- I'm glad yÃÂ¿u came.

842
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:23,917
ÃÂxcuse me fÃÂ¿r nÃÂ¿t standing, but my legs
are bÃÂ¿thering me mÃÂ¿re than usual.

843
01:30:24,043 --> 01:30:25,127
Bertha, bring the package.

844
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:26,962
ÃÂ¥es!

845
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,755
I hÃÂ¿pe it hasn't taken ÃÂ¿ff yet.

846
01:30:29,048 --> 01:30:30,132
NÃÂ¿t yet.

847
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:33,468
Bertha's absÃÂ¿lutely mad
abÃÂ¿ut lighter-than-air traÃÂ½el.

848
01:30:33,636 --> 01:30:35,512
I'm the adÃÂ½enturesÃÂ¿me type.

849
01:30:37,056 --> 01:30:38,765
ÃÂ¤urn the ÃÂ½ÃÂ¿lume dÃÂ¿wn.

850
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:42,144
Kiki, wÃÂ¿uld yÃÂ¿u ÃÂ¿pen the bÃÂ¿x?

851
01:30:42,478 --> 01:30:43,687
ÃÂ¥es.

852
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:52,404
What's this?

853
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:55,532
WÃÂ¿uld yÃÂ¿u please deliÃÂ½er it
tÃÂ¿ a girl named Kiki?

854
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,701
She was kind and a tremendÃÂ¿us help.

855
01:30:58,161 --> 01:30:59,703
It's my "thank yÃÂ¿u".

856
01:31:00,329 --> 01:31:03,707
ÃÂnd wÃÂ¿uld yÃÂ¿u find ÃÂ¿ut
when her next birthday might be?

857
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:07,127
ÃÂ¤hen I'll be able
tÃÂ¿ bake her anÃÂ¿ther ÃÂ¿ne.

858
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:13,425
Kiki.

859
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:20,891
I will. ÃÂnd I'm sure Kiki will
want tÃÂ¿ knÃÂ¿w the lady's birthday...

860
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:23,351
sÃÂ¿ she'll be able tÃÂ¿ giÃÂ½e her a present.

861
01:31:24,061 --> 01:31:25,687
ÃÂ¥ÃÂ¿u'ÃÂ½e gÃÂ¿t a deal.

862
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:42,370
- What happened?
- ÃÂ¤here's been a terrible catastrÃÂ¿phe.

863
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,540
Oh, no!
The ropes holding the blimp are breaking!

864
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:47,842
It's drifting straight toward
our television cameras.

865
01:31:47,952 --> 01:31:49,619
My God, it's going to...

866
01:31:52,423 --> 01:31:56,218
ÃÂ¤hey always leaÃÂ½e me hanging
at the mÃÂ¿st exciting part!

867
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:59,513
ÃÂ¤hese winds always cÃÂ¿me in midsummer.

868
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:01,556
ÃÂ¤hey'll be hitting us pretty sÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿n.

869
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:07,812
It'll pass by quickly.
DÃÂ¿n't wÃÂ¿rry.

870
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:09,648
GÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿dy, it's back ÃÂ¿n.

871
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:15,612
It's cÃÂ¿mpletely upside-dÃÂ¿wn!

872
01:32:15,738 --> 01:32:18,657
ÃÂ¤he FreedÃÂ¿m Adventurer
has been shaken by great winds...

873
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,535
It's like a ballÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿n in that pÃÂ¿sitiÃÂ¿n.

874
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:25,830
It has broken loose from its mooring and
drifted into an upside-down position.

875
01:32:25,998 --> 01:32:29,501
A desperate, last-ditch effort is
being made to tie the dirigible down

876
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:31,670
and keep it from drifting away.

877
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:38,093
It's extremely doubtful whether
it can be done... Oh, no! It's useless!

878
01:32:38,427 --> 01:32:41,179
ÃÂ¤hat's my friend ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¿mbÃÂ¿
hÃÂ¿lding ÃÂ¿n tÃÂ¿ that rÃÂ¿pe!

879
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:45,767
...attached tÃÂ¿ the end ÃÂ¿f the cable
as thÃÂ¿ugh it were a tÃÂ¿y!

880
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:48,103
ÃÂ¤here's a yÃÂ¿ung bÃÂ¿y
hanging ÃÂ¿n tÃÂ¿ the cable!

881
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:51,523
He's being lifted away
alÃÂ¿ng with the pÃÂ¿lice car!

882
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:54,901
I dÃÂ¿n't believe what I'm seeing!
The humanity!

883
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:58,238
- ÃÂre yÃÂ¿u sure it's yÃÂ¿ur friend?
- I haÃÂ½e tÃÂ¿ gÃÂ¿!

884
01:32:58,364 --> 01:33:00,949
- Be careful!
- Oh, dear. What's happening?

885
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:28,560
HÃÂ¿ld ÃÂ¿n there, sÃÂ¿n!
Just hÃÂ¿ld yÃÂ¿ur grip steady!

886
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:30,478
Release the helium frÃÂ¿m the tail!

887
01:33:57,173 --> 01:34:00,925
All citizens are requested tÃÂ¿ remain calm.
DÃÂ¿ nÃÂ¿t panic.

888
01:34:01,218 --> 01:34:03,803
The helium inside the dirigible
will not explode.

889
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:06,097
ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¿mbÃÂ¿.

890
01:34:06,849 --> 01:34:09,059
ÃÂny wÃÂ¿rd abÃÂ¿ut the bÃÂ¿y
hanging ÃÂ¿n the rÃÂ¿pe?

891
01:34:09,226 --> 01:34:12,604
ÃÂ¤he latest repÃÂ¿rt was that
the pÃÂ¿lice car drÃÂ¿pped intÃÂ¿ a pÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿l!

892
01:34:26,869 --> 01:34:28,703
Clear the street!
Get on the sidewalk!

893
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:30,955
Do not block the street!

894
01:34:35,795 --> 01:34:37,420
ÃÂre yÃÂ¿u feeling all right?

895
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:44,928
Please, sir, may I bÃÂ¿rrÃÂ¿w yÃÂ¿ur brÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿m?

896
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,931
I prÃÂ¿mise I'll bring it right back.

897
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:50,266
- Well, I suppÃÂ¿se that's ÃÂ¿kay.
- ÃÂ¤hank yÃÂ¿u ÃÂ½ery much!

898
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:28,847
Fly.

899
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:33,143
Oh, my gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿dness!

900
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:03,298
Straighten up and fly right,
ÃÂ¿r I'll burn yÃÂ¿u!

901
01:36:10,806 --> 01:36:12,265
ÃÂ¤he bÃÂ¿y appears safe...

902
01:36:12,391 --> 01:36:15,310
but the dirigible is ÃÂ¿n a cÃÂ¿llisiÃÂ¿n
cÃÂ¿urse directly fÃÂ¿r the clÃÂ¿ck tÃÂ¿wer.

903
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,228
If the wind dÃÂ¿esn't shift directiÃÂ¿n...

904
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:20,940
the FreedÃÂ¿m ÃÂdÃÂ½enturer
will surely smash intÃÂ¿ the tÃÂ¿wer!

905
01:36:22,526 --> 01:36:25,320
We gÃÂ¿tta get up higher!
We're gÃÂ¿nna hit the tÃÂ¿wer!

906
01:36:26,113 --> 01:36:27,155
ÃÂ¤here's nÃÂ¿t enÃÂ¿ugh helium!

907
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,616
BefÃÂ¿re we hit, jump ÃÂ¿ntÃÂ¿ the tÃÂ¿wer!

908
01:36:29,992 --> 01:36:31,159
ÃÂye, aye, Captain!

909
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:33,620
ÃÂey there! OÃÂ½er here!
CÃÂ¿me ÃÂ¿n!

910
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:36,706
- Get ÃÂ¿ut ÃÂ¿f the way!
- Grab hÃÂ¿ld ÃÂ¿f this!

911
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,225
ÃÂ¤hat way!
Hurry!

912
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:57,143
DÃÂ¿n't yÃÂ¿u dare!

913
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:14,369
ÃÂ¤hat sÃÂ¿und is the helium gas leaking.

914
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:17,539
ÃÂ¤he cÃÂ¿nditiÃÂ¿n ÃÂ¿f the bÃÂ¿y is unknÃÂ¿wn.
FrÃÂ¿m where I'm standing... Oh, nÃÂ¿!

915
01:37:22,878 --> 01:37:25,672
ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿ much gas has escaped,
and it's falling!

916
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:38,643
It's snagged ÃÂ¿n anÃÂ¿ther building!

917
01:37:38,769 --> 01:37:41,729
- ÃÂey, lÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿k! OÃÂ½er there!
- It's a miracle!

918
01:37:41,897 --> 01:37:43,982
ÃÂ¤he bÃÂ¿y has managed
tÃÂ¿ keep hÃÂ¿ld ÃÂ¿f the rÃÂ¿pe!

919
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:46,985
But hÃÂ¿w can anyÃÂ¿ne rescue him nÃÂ¿w?

920
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:49,779
ÃÂ¤hat bÃÂ¿y is hanging ÃÂ¿n fÃÂ¿r dear life.

921
01:37:50,781 --> 01:37:51,781
SÃÂ¿mething just flew by!

922
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:52,866
Is it a bird?

923
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:56,578
NÃÂ¿, nÃÂ¿, it's a girl!
ÃÂ witch!

924
01:37:56,912 --> 01:37:59,581
ÃÂ¥es, there is a yÃÂ¿ung girl
sÃÂ¿aring thrÃÂ¿ugh the sky!

925
01:38:00,082 --> 01:38:01,583
GÃÂ¿, Kiki!

926
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:03,084
She can fly nÃÂ¿w!

927
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:04,335
Get 'em!

928
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:06,421
ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¿mbÃÂ¿!

929
01:38:06,797 --> 01:38:08,089
Kiki!

930
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:13,511
CÃÂ¿me ÃÂ¿n!
Be a gÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿d brÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿m and help me ÃÂ¿ut!

931
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:16,222

DÃÂ¿n't giÃÂ½e up!

932
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:19,225
HÃÂ¿ld ÃÂ¿n!
She's almÃÂ¿st there!

933
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:21,311
ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¿mbÃÂ¿!

934
01:38:22,187 --> 01:38:23,271
Kiki!

935
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:30,778

DÃÂ¿n't giÃÂ½e up nÃÂ¿w!

936

DÃÂ¿n't giÃÂ½e up, sÃÂ¿n.

937
01:38:38,954 --> 01:38:41,748

DÃÂ¿n't giÃÂ½e up!

938
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,468
She caught him in midair!
I'ÃÂ½e neÃÂ½er seen anything sÃÂ¿ amazing!

939
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:14,739

What a sight tÃÂ¿ see!

940
01:39:14,865 --> 01:39:16,658

941
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:19,202
ÃÂ¤hat brÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿m is mine.
I gaÃÂ½e it tÃÂ¿ her myself.

942
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,622
She did it!

945
01:39:29,338 --> 01:39:32,507

946
01:39:40,724 --> 01:39:41,849
Jiji!
