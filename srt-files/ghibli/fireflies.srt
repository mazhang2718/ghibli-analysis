1
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:25,066
September 21, 1945.
That was the night I died.

2
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,015
So disgusting!

3
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,725
Watch it!

4
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,978
He's filthy.

5
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,437
Is he dead?

6
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,731
Such a disgraceful sight.

7
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,776
Don't want Americans to see this!

8
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,620
Mama!

9
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,709
What day is it today?

10
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,305
Setsuko...

11
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,108
Another one...

12
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,665
What's this?

13
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,877
Don't bother.
Just toss it.

14
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,475
This one is going too.

15
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,353
Those blank eyes
tell you it's over.

26
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,961
Everyone!
To the shelters!

27
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,174
Hear it's a large formation.

28
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,844
The shelter behind
the firehouse should be safe.

29
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,514
Maybe they'll bomb
elsewhere this time?

30
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,350
Makes me hot.

31
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,394
Now be a good girl
and put this on.

32
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,777
I'll have a head start now.

33
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,905
You two, be sure to hurry along.

34
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,700
Setsuko, listen to your big brother.

35
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,620
Mama, you should hurry and go!

36
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,121
Yes, dear.

37
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,375
Mama, you got your medicine?

38
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,710
Yes, I got it.

39
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,133
I don't like shelters.

40
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,886
You want to get blown to bits?

41
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,555
Climb on!

42
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,855
My doll!

43
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,410
To the shelters!

44
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,744
Seita.

45
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,926
Heads down!

46
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,024
No!

47
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,950
Seita! Seita! Seita!

48
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,880
Seita!

49
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,401
Hurry!
Did you get everything?

50
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,237
Don't forget that!
Quick!

51
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,793
Long live the Emperor!

52
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,982
Don't worry.
We're safe here.

53
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,569
Where did Mama go?

54
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,947
She's in the shelter.

55
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:21,620
It could stand even a 250-kg bomb.
She'll be fine.

56
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,343
Mama will come to
the twin pines.

57
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,179
We agreed to meet there.

58
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,515
Let's rest a little.

59
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,898
Everything all right, Setsuko?

60
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,901
I lost a clog.

61
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,197
I'll buy you a much better one.

62
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,493
I have money too.

63
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,001
Open this.

64
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,222
You're rich!

65
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,109
So this is black rain.

66
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,067
It's all gone...

67
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,446
Look, that's the public hall.

68
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,574
Remember we had porridge there?

69
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,454
Did our house burn down?

70
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,122
Seems like it.

71
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,124
What are we going to do?

72
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,628
Dad will make them pay.

73
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,479
Mama! Mama!

74
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,158
I'd feel guilty
if only our house was left.

75
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,911
Glad it's all gone.

76
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:12,666
Mr. Miura got a direct hit.
I feel so sorry for him.

77
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,627
I'm glad you were safe.

78
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,633
We got two direct hits.

79
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,136
The oil would spill
if we tried to move them.

80
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,140
No, it's not her!

81
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,687
Seita, I have to pee.

82
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,230
Okay.

83
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:50,245
Attention, residents of
Kaminaka, Kaminishi, and Ichirizuka!

84
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:56,126
Please go to the elementary school!
We've set up a first aid station!

85
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,210
What's wrong?

86
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,712
My eyes hurt.

87
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,213
Don't rub them.

88
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,925
Let's go get them washed.

89
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,762
Where's Mama?

90
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,764
- She'll be at school.
- School?

91
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,099
- Yes, let's hurry.
- Okay.

92
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,774
Don't cry.
Be good now.

93
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,409
Seita!

94
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,206
Have you seen your mother?

95
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,125
She's injured.
You must go at once.

96
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,419
I'll stay with her.

97
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,839
That was scary.
You didn't cry?

98
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,427
Let's wait for your brother here.

99
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,189
Seita, I've been looking for you.
How are you?

100
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,441
- Where's Mama?
- Come with me.

101
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,535
This is your Mama's.

102
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,748
In here.

103
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,595
She's finally asleep now.

104
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,146
She should be moved to a hospital.
We're asking about it.

105
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:44,276
I hear Kaisei Hospital wasn't hit.

106
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:50,198
Sir. Mama has a bad heart.
Can she get medicine for that?

107
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,492
Okay, we'll ask.

108
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,581
I'll come again.

109
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,629
Mama?

110
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,195
- You saw her?
- Yes...

111
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,280
I'm so sorry.

112
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,657
I'm thirsty.

113
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,081
Is there anything I can do?

114
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,045
I know.
Did you get biscuits?

115
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,214
I'll get you some.

116
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:02,395
Keep this ring in your purse.
Don't lose it, okay?

117
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:07,400
Mama's a little sick,
but she'll be better soon.

118
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,945
Where is she?

119
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,280
In a hospital in Nishinomiya.

120
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,912
So tonight, we'll stay at school.

121
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,917
Then tomorrow...
Remember our aunt in Nishinomiya?

122
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,585
We're going there.

123
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,296
Okay?

124
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,686
We're staying upstairs.
Won't you join us?

125
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,109
Thank you, we'll go later.

126
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,070
See you later then.

127
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,116
Want to eat?

128
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,035
I want to go see Mama.

129
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,914
Maybe tomorrow.
It's late now.

130
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,011
Hey, look at this!

131
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:26,247
Can't unwrap her.
Better not look.

132
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:30,210
Especially in this heat...
Got to get rid of this today.

133
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,396
Where's your little sister?

134
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,691
I took her to Nishinomiya this morning.

135
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,443
Distant relatives are taking us in.

136
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,113
Glad to hear that.

137
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:02,492
Well, I must get back to my duties.
You take care.

138
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,790
Mama!

139
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,417
Where's Mama?

140
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,545
Is Mama still not feeling good?

141
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,672
That's right.
She got hurt in the air raid.

142
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,466
You're back.

143
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,721
How was it?
Was she in Kaisei Hospital?

144
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,807
Err, yes...

145
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:54,687
Navy folks are so privileged.
Using a truck even to evacuate!

146
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,317
Mosquito net and beddings
are in your room.

147
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,860
Thank you.

148
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,497
Doesn't Mama
need this ring anymore?

149
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,751
Do I get to keep it?

150
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,050
You should put that away.

151
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,767
About Mama...

152
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:39,524
- We'll visit Mama when she's better.
- Okay.

153
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,569
- Go to bed now.
- Okay.

154
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,937
Herrings, dried bonito,
dried potatoes, and eggs.

155
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,314
There're pickled plums.

156
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,693
Why, this is butter!

157
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,365
You'd never know
things are scarce in wartime.

158
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,368
You military folks are spoiled.

159
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,080
So, did you stop by the hospital?

160
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,166
Your mother and I must talk
about the future.

161
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:06,337
I could take Setsuko along
and visit her.

162
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,882
She didn't make it?!

163
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,511
Mama died at school two days ago.

164
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,014
What?!
Your Mama died...!

165
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,519
Why didn't you tell me right away?

166
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,230
You should know better.

167
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,858
Didn't want Setsuko to know.

168
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,403
Your Mama's dead...

169
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,739
This is bad.

170
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,576
Must inform your father at once!

171
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:43,916
Seita!

172
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,503
She bought me new clogs.

173
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,340
Good for you.

174
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,092
Welcome home.

175
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,072
Tough times for you kids.

176
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,740
Thank you for the bath.

177
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,454
What's that sound?

178
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,333
Don't be scared.
They're bullfrogs.

179
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,793
A firefly!

180
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,302
Here, catch.

181
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,310
Oh no!
You squished it!

182
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,813
It smells.

183
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,065
You squeezed too tight.

184
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,971
Look at all those fireflies!

185
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,028
Setsuko, close your eyes
and say "aah."

186
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,613
What for?

187
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,657
Just say "aah."

188
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,504
Fruit drops!

189
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,175
Fruit drops, fruit drops!

190
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,355
I almost swallowed it.

191
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,249
- We're back.
- What took you so long?

192
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,504
Did you thank the lady?

193
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:36,839
Yes, Ma'am.

194
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,552
That looked good.

195
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:14,961
Seita, don't you have to go to school?

196
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:20,383
Kobe Steel where I was mobilized
was destroyed.

197
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,678
And my school burned,
so there is no place left to go.

198
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,473
And did you send your father a letter?

199
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,476
Yes, in care of Kure Naval Base.

200
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,811
When?

201
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,939
Over ten days ago,
after we came here.

202
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,150
That's strange.

203
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,696
He hasn't replied to me either.

204
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,033
Setsuko, be sure to return those.

205
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,961
How is the war situation?

206
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,297
Getting worse, I'm afraid.

207
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:04,176
Factories must step up for
those that burned.

208
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,680
All we hear is
"Gear up for final battle."

209
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:13,769
Food rations keep getting worse too.

210
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:18,524
We're all suffering in this war.

211
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:24,155
My girl is also working for our country.

212
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,616
You must eat and put on strength.

213
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,876
Not again.

214
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,712
Taking in two more must be tough.

215
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:45,885
But poor things.
They're still so young.

216
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,262
Is your heat rash itchy?

217
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,724
It's hot in here.
I hate shelters.

218
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,269
Hang in there.
I'm here for you.

219
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:10,409
- Want to go to the beach?
- Yes! Yes, let's go!

220
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,594
It's all vegetable fields now!

221
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,988
What are they doing?

222
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,656
Getting salt water.

223
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:35,077
- Not enough salt or soy sauce at home.
- I see.

224
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,329
Now take off your clothes!

225
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,277
Might be a bit cold.

226
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,321
It's cold!

227
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:15,284
- Isn't this soothing on your rash?
- Uh-huh.

228
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,377
It's a huge bathtub!

229
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,129
Hey you!

230
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:34,345
Wait!

231
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,728
I'm a bear!
I'm going to eat you!

232
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:09,588
Snip, snip, snip.

233
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,887
Look.
Somebody is sleeping.

234
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,690
Don't look at that.

235
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,696
Summertime, I'll teach you how to swim.

236
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,576
But I'll get hungry if I swim.

237
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,666
But I'll get hungry if I swim.

238
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,843
Seita!

239
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:59,471
Setsuko!
Come indoors!

240
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,396
You must be hungry!

241
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:11,358
There are ice-cold drinks too!

242
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:46,685
Mama! Did you wait long?
I'm so glad you came.

243
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,229
How are you doing?

244
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,524
I'm doing fine.
Everyone is nice here.

245
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,860
I'm hungry.

246
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,865
Get up.
There's an air raid coming.

247
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,535
I'm tired.
I want a piggyback ride.

248
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,331
To the shelters!

249
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:22,054
Your mother won't need
her kimono anymore.

250
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,390
Why not exchange it for rice?

251
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,895
I've been slowly trading
my things for more food too.

252
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,940
This should get about 15-kg.

253
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,692
15-kg...?!

254
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:40,197
You must also eat to build
a strong body and go to war.

255
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,408
This is worth 15-kg?

256
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:46,578
I'm sure your mother
will be happier this way.

257
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,664
I'll take these now.

258
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,791
No!

259
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,419
Setsuko, you're awake.

260
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:58,257
They're Mama's!
They're Mama's!

261
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,385
No! You can't take them!

262
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,054
Setsuko, let go.

263
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,850
No, no, no!

264
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,894
Setsuko! Setsuko!

265
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,978
Isn't this fine rice?

266
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,983
Setsuko, we'll have
steamed rice tonight.

267
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,655
These are for you two to keep.

268
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,499
Look! It's rice, Setsuko.

269
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,637
Here you go.

270
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:33,477
The two are working late.
Too bad they can't eat while it's hot.

271
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,731
Setsuko, isn't this rice yummy?

272
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,402
I want more!

273
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,613
Yes, dear.

274
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,786
Setsuko eats a lot when it's rice.

275
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,996
It tastes so good!

276
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,878
What's the matter?

277
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,464
I don't want porridge.

278
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,884
Aren't there any pickled plums?

279
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,179
You know they're long gone.

280
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,390
Here's your lunch.

281
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,724
Thank you.

282
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,059
Have a nice day.

283
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,189
- I'll be off.
- You take care.

284
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,609
We'll have rice balls for lunch, so eat.

285
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:26,572
Enough! Our lunch will be porridge!

286
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:33,912
You loafers expect to eat the same
as those working for our country?!

287
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:41,461
Seita, you're old enough
to understand about helping out.

288
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:48,427
You don't share your rice, but now you want
more of ours. That's unacceptable!

289
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:02,774
Give you a little bit of rice,
and already you're spoiled!

290
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,485
But that's our rice.

291
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,947
Are you saying your aunt isn't fair?

292
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:14,828
You sure talk big. This is what I get
for taking in two orphans?

293
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,872
Well then.

294
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:22,127
From now on, we'll eat separately.
That should be fair.

295
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,506
Seita, you have relatives
in Tokyo, don't you?

296
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:31,345
One's on your mother's side?
Why don't you write to them?

297
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,432
Nishinomiya could be
firebombed anytime.

298
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,143
But I don't have their address.

299
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,195
Let's hurry home.

300
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:51,239
Yes, Daddy is waiting for us.

301
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:56,787
Frogs are singing.
Let's go home.

302
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,501
Sorry for the long wait!

303
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,131
What is it?

304
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,635
I'm hungry.
I'm thirsty too.

305
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:12,844
Alrighty.

306
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,184
Here, have a fruit drop.

307
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:24,064
Mama had 7,000 yen
saved in the bank.

308
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:30,320
7,000! That's plenty to live on.
We're going to be all right.

309
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:37,911
I'm telling Dad to write back soon,
because Setsuko is waiting.

310
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,090
You two are in luck.

311
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:55,137
You can't find such a good stove
nowadays at any price.

312
00:41:55,263 --> 00:42:01,643
Items are scarce, especially hardware.
Can't get those anywhere!

313
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:07,566
I'll take that comb,
and do you have an umbrella?

314
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,986
I'm afraid not.
Oh, but wait.

315
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:16,366
Rain, rain, fall, fall.
So happy my big brother came

316
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:20,954
With an umbrella to take me home.

317
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:25,417
Splish-splish, splash-splash, la-la-la!

318
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,306
Good fire, huh?

319
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,183
Just be careful with that.

320
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,434
We will!

321
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,773
What's up with those two?

322
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,317
They're cooking on their own now.

323
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,529
That's very noble of them.
More, please.

324
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:57,657
Mama, were you harsh on them again?

325
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,744
So I was, but they won't apologize.

326
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,956
Then they bought cooking equipment,
just to spite me!

327
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,292
I'm done!

328
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,800
That's bad manners, Seita.

329
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,095
You can relax too.

330
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,649
That's for two.

331
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:31,650
That's it?!

332
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:35,654
The next ration should be in July.

333
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,085
Let me do it.

334
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,111
Is it sweet?

335
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,412
I can taste so many flavors!

336
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:55,126
Grape, strawberry, melon, mint...
Setsuko, you can have it all.

337
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,264
It's all gone!

338
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:15,146
Gone to bed without
washing their dishes!

339
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,148
Doing as they please.

340
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,860
Those brats are so annoying!

341
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:24,030
Not again!

342
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,407
Mama!

343
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:29,661
Seita! Others here are
working for our country.

344
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,872
At least stop that girl's crying!

345
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,128
With the nightly raids and crying,
how can we sleep?!

346
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:09,200
Chubu military area information.

347
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:14,122
Enemy bombers are flying north
along the Kii Channel.

348
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,791
Are you going to the cave again?

349
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:21,588
You're old enough to help
fire fighting duties!

350
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,595
All clear!

351
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:38,396
I want to go home.
I hate living with our aunt.

352
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:43,068
We don't have a home.
It was burned.

353
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:55,246
E - D - C - D - E - A - G
E - E - E - D - C - D

354
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,414
Let's sing!

355
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:03,546
Carp streamers
Up higher than the roof.

356
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:10,428
The big black carp is the Dad.

357
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,930
Stop it!

358
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:17,310
Are you crazy? We're at war!
I'll get yelled for that!

359
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:22,732
You pests bring us
nothing but trouble!

360
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,610
You're useless in raids.

361
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,572
If you're so scared,
then go live in that cave!

362
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,828
You know what?

363
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,081
This can be our home.

364
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:45,296
Nobody comes here. It's sturdy.
We can do whatever we want.

365
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,757
It's all right to do that?

366
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:15,827
Thank you for everything.
We're going.

367
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:18,329
Going...?
Where to?

368
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,790
We're not sure yet.

369
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:26,838
Well, take care then.
Goodbye, Setsuko!

370
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,527
This will be the kitchen.

371
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,740
This is the front door.

372
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,870
Where's the bathroom going to be?

373
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:03,208
That can be anywhere.
I'll go with you.

374
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,011
Thank you for the cart!

375
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,388
Just leave it there.

376
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:24,103
Could you sell us
more straw and some food?

377
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:28,107
There isn't much to sell,
but sure.

378
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:55,802
There you go!

379
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,540
- My mouth is watering.
- I'm hungry!

380
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,944
Heard you could eat those too.

381
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,487
Frogs?

382
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,740
They say they're good.

383
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,662
I'll do the rest.
You go wait in the net.

384
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,090
What is it?

385
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,301
I left my toothbrush.

386
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:21,179
Then don't brush tonight.

387
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:28,102
You'll get bug bites.
Stay inside the net.

388
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:30,396
It's dark and I'm scared.

389
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,696
I'll go for a pee.
Want to go too?

390
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,620
It's a kamikaze plane.

391
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,456
Looks like a firefly.

392
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,999
It does.

393
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:53,378
Hey, let's catch fireflies.

394
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,381
Get in.

395
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:12,480
I can see your face!

396
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:13,690
I can see you too.

397
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,195
Look, it's a hairpin.

398
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:27,578
Now, let's see a
firefly light show!

399
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,261
Before you were born,
I went to a naval review.

400
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,180
A naval review?

401
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:32,435
Dad was on the cruiser Maya.
The entire combined fleet was there!

402
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:13,893
Iron castle afloat on the sea.

403
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:18,022
For offense and defense,
we trust in thee.

404
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,149
Enemy attack!

405
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,996
I wonder where Dad is fighting now.

406
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,820
No, let go!

407
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:44,942
What's that?

408
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:50,406
It's a grave.
Mama's also in a grave, right?

409
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:58,372
Auntie told me.

410
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:03,127
Mama is already dead
and in a grave.

411
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,243
We'll go to her grave one day.

412
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:41,457
Setsuko, do you remember
the cemetery near Nunobiki?

413
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:47,254
That's where Mama is.
Under a big camphor tree...

414
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:50,800
Why do fireflies
have to die so soon?

415
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:32,049
Hey, somebody is living here.

416
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,926
Homeless, maybe?

417
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,053
What if he's here?

418
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:39,765
There's even a swing.

419
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,059
A kid lives here.
What's this?

420
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,895
May you rest in peace!

421
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,567
Wish this were real.

422
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,528
Hey! It says "Setsuko".

423
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,197
Look! Dried frogs!

424
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,283
They eat those?!

425
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:01,912
Wonder if the evacuated boys
also eat stuff like this?

426
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:05,541
Yuck! Ground soybeans!

427
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,626
Worse than what we eat!

428
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,378
It's a ghost!

429
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:15,259
Wait!

430
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:17,970
Wait for me!

431
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:27,521
And we've already traded
all of our mother's kimono for rice.

432
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:29,732
You used to take money...

433
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,737
This isn't about kimono or money.

434
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:39,784
I'm a farmer, but even I don't
have extra food to share.

435
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,793
Any other relatives?

436
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,295
We can't contact them.

437
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:55,466
Then be wise.
Go back to your aunt's.

438
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,928
Everything is rationed nowadays.

439
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,597
We must rely on
neighborhood groups.

440
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,518
Tell her you're sorry
and want to stay.

441
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:14,819
Thank you,
but we'll try elsewhere.

442
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:20,116
You're a navy man's son!
Be strong!

443
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,482
It's okay?

444
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:34,190
Oh, no!

445
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:38,420
You must eat
your beans and millet.

446
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:41,382
You got to eat to grow big!

447
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:43,801
Seita?

448
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:50,349
Something is wrong with my tummy.

449
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,809
Are you cold?

450
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:55,813
The diarrhea doesn't go away.

451
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:02,653
You bastard!

452
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:05,322
Forgive me!

453
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:08,993
I'm sorry!
Please let me go!

454
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:13,580
Wanted some sugar
for my sick sister!

455
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:18,127
Shut up! Stealing crops is
a serious crime in wartime!

456
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:23,007
You're not going to
get away with this!

457
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:37,229
What?
Even dug up these small ones?

458
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,858
So you're the crop thief!

459
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:42,359
Seita!

460
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:47,364
Please forgive me.
I won't do it again!

461
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,367
No, we're going to the police!

462
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,121
I'm sending you off to jail!

463
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:58,250
My sister is really sick!
She has no one but me!

464
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:01,128
Seita! Seita!

465
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,964
Seita!

466
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:09,011
Seita. Seita...

467
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:17,978
Understood.
I'll talk to him and file a report.

468
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,732
That will be enough.
You can go now.

469
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:24,068
But...

470
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,446
You've beaten him enough.

471
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,574
It's an injurious assault...

472
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,535
...to a minor!

473
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,579
I will be going then...!

474
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:42,586
Tonight's air raid was in Fukui.

475
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:48,175
Why not come in
for a drink of water?

476
01:04:58,186 --> 01:04:59,395
Setsuko.

477
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,946
Seita!

478
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,505
Seita.

479
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:39,685
Where does it hurt?
You must see a doctor and get a shot.

480
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:46,525
Setsuko!

481
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:58,162
Seita, I want to go
to the toilet.

482
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,876
- Can you hold it?
- Uh-huh.

483
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:05,961
Get on my back.

484
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:20,350
The brother went to the mountain
to cut firewood. The grandmother...

485
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,070
Hurry! Hurry!

486
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,068
Setsuko, let's eat.

487
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:19,826
Today's pumpkin is good!
It tastes like real bean jelly.

488
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:22,746
I hate bean jelly.

489
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:27,584
Come on, Dad'll get mad
at me if you don't eat.

490
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:31,380
I'll help you,
so cheer up and eat!

491
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,886
When you get well,
we'll go to the beach again.

492
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,805
Go, go! Yay!

493
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:47,789
Bang!

494
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,902
This will bring us food, Setsuko!

495
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,205
Seita...?

496
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,754
Seita?

497
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:41,176
You say this was your Mama's?

498
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:45,389
How can this cheap flimsy thing
be a keepsake?!

499
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:55,982
Setsuko?

500
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:58,694
Setsuko?

501
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:26,722
Setsuko!

502
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:38,233
Seita...
Water...

503
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:49,786
Breathe in.

504
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:52,289
Breathe out.

505
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:58,795
And she's had diarrhea
for many days now.

506
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:04,509
The rash isn't from the heat.
Seawater just hurts her skin.

507
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,973
She's weak from malnutrition.

508
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,142
Thus, the diarrhea.

509
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,101
Okay, next!

510
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:15,479
Can you give her
medicine or a shot?

511
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,647
I hate shots!

512
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:21,443
Please give her
some medical treatment.

513
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:26,823
Medicine won't help.
All she needs is nutrition.

514
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,825
Nutrition...?

515
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:30,994
What's wrong?

516
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,205
But where can I get that?!

517
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:26,466
Am I hungry.
What do you want to eat?

518
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:32,097
Tempura, sashimi, tokoroten noodles...

519
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:33,390
Anything else?

520
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:37,060
Ice cream. And...

521
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:40,355
I want fruit drops again.

522
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:43,817
Fruit drops?
Alrighty.

523
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,740
I'll go withdraw all our savings.

524
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:56,079
I don't need anything.
Please stay home with me.

525
01:12:56,330 --> 01:13:02,085
Don't go! Don't go! Don't go!

526
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,171
Don't worry, Setsuko.

527
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:09,759
I'll go buy rice and
nutritious food for you...

528
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:15,432
Then, I'll never ever leave.
I'll always be with you.

529
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:18,602
I promise.

530
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,125
Here's 3,000 yen.

531
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:44,336
A typhoon is coming?

532
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:49,591
What a joke! Our "divine wind"
comes after we've surrendered.

533
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:52,677
Surrendered...?
We lost the war?!

534
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,305
You didn't know?

535
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:02,354
Is it true?
The Great Empire of Japan lost?

536
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,607
Yes, it was
unconditional surrender.

537
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:08,234
Where's our fleet?

538
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:09,569
They're long gone.

539
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:13,114
All sunk!
Not even a ship left.

540
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,032
What?!

541
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:18,787
Dad's cruiser too?!
Is that why we got no reply?!

542
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:20,497
How should I know?

543
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:23,708
Strange boy.

544
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,464
Dad, I hate you!

545
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,607
I'm so hungry.

546
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,489
Dad.

547
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:03,999
Now even Dad's dead.

548
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,544
Now even Dad's dead.

549
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,797
Now even Dad's...

550
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:58,887
Setsuko, sorry I'm so late.
I'll make you rice gruel.

551
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:00,930
It went up.

552
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:05,393
It went down.

553
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:10,190
Oh, it stopped.

554
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:13,151
Even got chicken and eggs!

555
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,197
And there's also...

556
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,041
What's that in your mouth?!

557
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:35,507
This is a marble.
It's not a fruit drop!

558
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:42,055
You're getting something
better today. Your favorite.

559
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:48,186
Seita, this is for you.

560
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,275
What is it, Setsuko?

561
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,444
It's steamed rice.

562
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:01,324
Here's some cooked soy pulp.

563
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,787
Please eat.

564
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,585
You're not having any?

565
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,462
Setsuko...!

566
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:27,725
See? It's watermelon.
I didn't steal this either.

567
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:41,698
Here, have some.

568
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,249
It's yummy...

569
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:59,716
Hold on. I'll make you
rice gruel with eggs.

570
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:09,517
I'll leave these here for you.

571
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,145
Okay?

572
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,023
Seita...

573
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:17,901
Thank you.

574
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:46,221
Setsuko never woke up.

575
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:41,192
Here's a special ration of charcoal.

576
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,988
You can cremate the child
on temple grounds.

577
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:50,410
Undress the body, and use dry husks
to start a good fire.

578
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,871
The weather is so fine today!

579
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:03,673
- Nothing has changed!
- It's great to be back home!

580
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:10,263
We can finally listen
to the gramophone!

581
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:17,270
I missed this lovely view!

582
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,984
Come home soon!

583
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:43,953
Next morning...

584
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:48,791
I put Setsuko's ashes
into the drops tin and left.

585
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:52,086
I never went to the cave again.

586
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:00,970
Seita!

587
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:20,656
- It's late. Go to sleep now.
- Okay.
