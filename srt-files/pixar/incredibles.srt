1
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,837
- Is this on?
- That's fine.

2
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,076
I can break through walls,
I just can't...

3
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,509
- That's fine.
- I can't get this on.

4
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,597
Mr. Incredible...
Do you have a secret identity?

5
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,679
Every superhero has a secret identity.
I don't know a single one who doesn't.

6
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,796
Who wants the pressure
of being super all the time?

7
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,597
Of course I have a secret identity.

8
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:05,796
Can you see me in this
at the supermarket? Come on.

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,593
Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl,
know what I mean?

10
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:13,989
Superladies, they're always trying
to tell you their secret identity.

11
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,271
Think it'll strengthen
the relationship or something.

12
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,480
I said, "Girl, I don't want to know
about your mild-mannered alter ego."

13
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,912
I mean, you tell me you're
a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe,

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,873
that's all right with me.
I'm good. I'm good.

15
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,155
No matter how many times
you save the world,

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,397
it always manages to get back
in jeopardy again.

17
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:39,796
Sometimes I just want it to stay saved,
you know?

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,070
For a little bit. I feel like the maid.
"I just cleaned up this mess.

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,430
Can we keep it clean
for ten minutes?"

20
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,397
I could get to that point.

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,233
- "Please?"
- We're not finished.

22
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,516
Sometimes I think I'd just like
the simple life, you know?

23
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,995
Relax a little and raise a family.

24
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,152
Settle down? Are you kidding?
I'm at the top of my game!

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,713
I'm up there with the big dogs!
Girls, come on.

26
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,037
Leave the saving of the world
to the men? I don't think so.

27
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,518
I don't think so.

28
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,435
We interrupt
for a bulletin.

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,632
A high-speed pursuit between
police and armed gunmen is underway,

30
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:32,028
traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave.

31
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,950
Yeah, I've got time.

32
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,471
Mr. Incredible.

33
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,670
- What is it, ma'am?
- My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.

34
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,431
Certainly. I suggest you stand clear.
There could be trouble.

35
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,992
No, he's quite tame.

36
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,433
Let go now.

37
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,747
Thank you, Mr. Incredible.
You've done it again.

38
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,836
- You're the best.
- No, I'm just here to help.

39
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,348
All units.
We have a tour bus robbery...

40
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,868
Tour bus robbery. I've still got time.

41
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,075
Officers. Ma'am. Squeaker.

42
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,750
- Cool! Ready for take-off!
- What the...?

43
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:06,394
- Who are you supposed to be?
- I'm IncrediBoy.

44
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,919
What? No.

45
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,110
You're that kid from the fan club.

46
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,038
Brophy. Brody.
Buddy! Buddy!

47
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,872
My name is IncrediBoy.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,956
I've been nice, I've stood for photos,

49
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,514
signed every scrap of paper
you pushed at me...

50
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,108
No, don't worry about training me.
I know your moves,

51
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,033
crime fighting style,
favorite catch phrases, everything!

52
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,757
I'm your number one fan!

53
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,637
Hey! Hey, wait!

54
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,507
You know...

55
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,427
...you can tell a lot about a woman
by the contents of her purse,

56
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,153
but maybe that's not
what you had in mind.

57
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,430
Hey, look...

58
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,988
Elastigirl.

59
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,031
Mr. Incredible.

60
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,394
- It's all right. I've got him.
- Sure, you've got him.

61
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,475
- I just took him out for you.
- Sure, you did.

62
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,160
- His attention was on me.
- A fact I exploited to do my job.

63
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,033
- My job, you mean.
- A simple thank you will suffice.

64
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,156
Thanks, but I don't need any help.

65
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,156
Whatever happened to "ladies first"?

66
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,310
Well, whatever happened
to equal treatment?

67
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,874
Look, the lady got me first.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,992
- Well, we could share, you know.
- I work alone.

69
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,475
Well, I think you need to be more...

70
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,514
...flexible.

71
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,834
Are you doing anything later?

72
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,189
I have a previous engagement.

73
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,115
Now, you just stay here.

74
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,992
They usually pick up
the garbage in an hour.

75
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,548
- Hey, Incredible!
- Hey, Frozone!

76
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,911
- Shouldn't you be getting ready?
- I still got time.

77
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,351
He's gonna jump!

78
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,956
I think you broke something.

79
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,752
With counseling,
I think you'll come to forgive me.

80
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,552
Wait a minute.

81
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,312
Bomb Voyage.

82
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,555
And IncrediBoy!

83
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,079
IncrediBoy?

84
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,869
Aren't you curious about how I get
around so fast? I have rocket boots.

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,478
- Go home, Buddy. Now.
- What?

86
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,874
Can we talk?

87
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,951
You always say be true to yourself,

88
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:05,752
but you never say
which part to be true to.

89
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,430
Well, I've finally figured out who I am.
I am your ward... IncrediBoy!

90
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:13,432
And now, you have officially
carried it too far, Buddy.

91
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,754
This is because I don't have powers,
isn't it?

92
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,790
Not every superhero has powers,
you know.

93
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,637
You can be super without them.

94
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,069
I invented these.
I can fly. Can you fly?

95
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,310
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

96
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,317
Just give me one chance!
I'll show you. I'll go get the police.

97
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,795
- Buddy, don't!
- It'll only take a second, really.

98
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,637
No, stop!
There's a bomb!

99
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,709
Let go, you're wrecking
my flight pattern.

100
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,512
- I can do this if you let go!
- Will you just...?

101
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,711
- I'm trying to help! Stop!
- Let go of my cape!

102
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,593
Take this one home. And make sure
his mom knows what he's been doing.

103
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,517
I can help you.
You're making a mist...

104
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,591
The injured jumper.
You sent paramedics?

105
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,596
They picked him up.

106
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,314
The blast in that building
was caused by Bomb Voyage

107
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,873
who I caught robbing the vault.

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,115
We might nab him
if we set up a perimeter.

109
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,071
- He got away?
- Well, yeah.

110
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,548
- Skippy here made sure of that.
- IncrediBoy.

111
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:49,716
You're not affiliated with me!
Holy smokes, I'm late.

112
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,909
Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.

113
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,032
- What about Bomb Voyage?
- Any other night, I'd go after him,

114
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,038
but I really gotta go. Don't worry.
We'll get him! Eventually!

115
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,078
- Is the night still young?
- You're very late.

116
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,431
- How do I look? Good?
- The mask. You still got the mask.

117
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,638
Showtime.

118
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,749
Robert Parr, will you have this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

119
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,792
You're late. When you asked
if I was doing anything later,

120
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,037
I didn't realize you'd forgotten.
I thought it was playful banter.

121
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,434
- It was.
- Cutting it close, don't you think?

122
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,908
You need to be more... flexible.

123
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,269
I love you, but if we're
gonna make this work,

124
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,470
you've gotta be more
than Mr. Incredible.

125
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,515
You know that. Don't you?

126
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,948
...so long as you both shall live?
- I do.

127
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,832
I pronounce this couple
husband and wife.

128
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,870
As long as we both shall live.
No matter what happens.

129
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,913
Hey, come on. We're superheroes.
What could happen?

130
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,793
In a stunning turn of
events, a superhero is being sued

131
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,071
for saving someone who,
apparently, didn't want to be saved.

132
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:07,115
The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,

133
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,192
who was foiled in his attempted
suicide by Mr. Incredible,

134
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,153
has filed suit against the famed
superhero in Superior Court.

135
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,437
Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved.
He didn't want to be saved.

136
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:20,393
The injury received from
Mr. Incredible's "actions",

137
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,674
- Causes him daily pain.
- I saved your life!

138
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,950
You didn't save my life!
You ruined my death.

139
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,638
My client has no comment.

140
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,878
Another suit was filed
by victims of the el train accident.

141
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,230
Incredible's court losses
cost the government millions.

142
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,511
And opened the flood gates for dozens
of superhero lawsuits the world over.

143
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,309
It is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity.

144
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,238
Time for them to join us, or go away.

145
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,113
Under public pressure,
and the financial burden

146
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,548
of an ever mounting series of lawsuits,

147
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,355
the government quietly initiated
the superhero relocation program.

148
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,916
The supers were granted amnesty
from responsibility for past actions,

149
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,158
in exchange for the promise
to never again resume hero work.

150
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,871
Where are they now?

151
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,077
They are living among us.
Average citizens, average heroes.

152
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:13,596
Quietly and anonymously continuing
to make the world a better place.

153
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,998
Denied? You're denying my claim?

154
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,513
I don't understand.
I have full coverage.

155
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,952
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,

156
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,076
but our liability is spelled out
in paragraph 17.

157
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,918
- It states clearly...
- I can't pay for this.

158
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,711
Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr.

159
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,274
I'm calling to celebrate
a momentous occasion.

160
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,549
We're now officially moved in.

161
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,351
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.

162
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,669
The last three years
don't count because...

163
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,587
Because I finally unpacked the last box.
Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha.

164
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,597
- Why do we have so much junk?
- Listen, I've got a client.

165
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,552
Say no more. Go save the world
one policy at a time, honey.

166
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,955
Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids.
See you tonight.

167
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:55,032
Bye, honey.
Excuse me. Where were we?

168
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,947
I'm on a fixed income,
and if you can't help me,

169
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,190
I don't know what I'll do.

170
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,830
All right, listen closely.
I'd like to help you, but I can't.

171
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,429
I'd like to tell you to take a copy
of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

172
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,594
Norma Wilcox. W-l-L-C-O-X.
On the third floor. But I can't.

173
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,149
I also do not advise you
to fill out and file a WS2475 form

174
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,509
with our legal department
on the second floor.

175
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,035
I wouldn't expect someone to get back
to you quickly to resolve the matter.

176
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,514
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

177
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,076
- Oh, thank you, young man.
- Sorry. I know you're upset!

178
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,873
Pretend to be upset.

179
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,197
Parr!

180
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,629
You authorized payment
on the Walker policy!

181
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,875
Someone broke
into their house, Mr. Huph.

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,753
- Their policy covers...
- I don't wanna know about it.

183
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,509
Don't tell me about it. Tell me how
you're keeping Insuricare in the black.

184
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,033
Tell me how that's possible,
with you writing checks

185
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:00,947
to every Harry Hardluck and Sally
Sobstory that gives you a phone call.

186
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,913
Morning break is over.
Morning break is over.

187
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,269
I appreciate you coming
down here, Mrs. Parr.

188
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,514
What's this about?
Has Dash done something wrong?

189
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,599
He's a disruptive influence and he
openly mocks me in front of the class.

190
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,955
- He says.
- Look, I know it's you!

191
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,957
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool.
- You saw him do this?

192
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,719
Well... not really. No.

193
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,875
Actually, not.

194
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,916
Oh, then how do you know it was him?

195
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,428
I hid a camera.
Yeah, and this time, I've got him.

196
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,153
See? You see?

197
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,753
You don't see it?

198
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,909
He moves! Right there!

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,436
Wait, wait! Right there!

200
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,111
Right as I'm sitting down!

201
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,878
I don't know how he does it,

202
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,149
but there's no tack before he moves

203
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:02,192
and after he moves, there's a tack.
Coincidence? I think not!

204
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,639
- Bernie...
- Don't "Bernie" me.

205
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,711
This little rat is guilty!

206
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:14,032
You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr.
I'm sorry for the trouble.

207
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,957
You're letting him go again?
He's guilty!

208
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,515
You can see it on his smug little face.
Guilty, I say, guilty!

209
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,676
Dash, this is the third time this year
you've been sent to the office.

210
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,077
We need to find a better outlet.
A more... constructive outlet.

211
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,033
Maybe I could,
if you'd let me go out for sports.

212
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:38,150
Honey, you know why we can't do that.

213
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:42,671
I promise I'll slow up.
I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

214
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,909
Dashiell Robert Parr,

215
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,991
you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff.

216
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,110
The last thing you need is temptation.

217
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,437
You always say, "Do your best."
But you don't really mean it.

218
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,629
Why can't I do the best that I can do?

219
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,955
Right now, honey,
the world just wants us to fit in,

220
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,639
and to fit in, we just gotta be
like everybody else.

221
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,320
Dad always said our powers
were nothing to be ashamed of.

222
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,153
- Our powers made us special.
- Everyone's special, Dash.

223
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,707
Which is another way
of saying no one is.

224
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:21,278
Rydinger, where you headed?

225
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,710
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

226
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,792
- Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?
- That's kind of funny.

227
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,988
Hey, Tony, do you play football?

228
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,794
Tony, I thought we were
gonna go swimming.

229
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,390
He looked at me.

230
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,514
Come on, Violet!

231
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,352
Darn kids.
Sitting on the driveway...

232
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,630
Oh, great.

233
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,111
Mom.

234
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,676
- You're making weird faces again.
- No, I'm not.

235
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,075
You make weird faces, honey.

236
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,556
- Do you have to read at the table?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

237
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,399
Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes!

238
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,273
Bob, could you help
the carnivore cut his meat.

239
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,590
Dash, you have something you
wanna tell your father about school?

240
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,315
- Well, we dissected a frog.
- Dash got sent to the office again.

241
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,828
- Good. Good.
- No, Bob, that's bad.

242
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,951
- What?
- Dash got sent to the office again.

243
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,798
- What?! What for?
- Nothing.

244
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,673
He put a tack on the teacher's chair...
during class.

245
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,314
Nobody saw me.
You could barely see it on the tape.

246
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,432
They caught you on tape
and you still got away with it? Whoa!

247
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,914
You must have been booking.
How fast were you going?

248
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,519
We are not encouraging this.

249
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,596
I'm not, I'm just asking how fast...

250
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,278
Honey!

251
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,317
Great. First the car,
now I gotta pay to fix the table...

252
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,998
What happened to the car?

253
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,878
Here. I'm getting a new plate.

254
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,070
So, how about you, Vi?
How was school?

255
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,838
- Nothing to report.
- You've hardly touched your food.

256
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,395
- I'm not hungry for meatloaf.
- Well, it is leftover night.

257
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:01,317
We have steak, pasta...
What are you hungry for?

258
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,000
- Tony Rydinger.
- Shut up.

259
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,952
- Well, you are.
- I said, shut up, you little insect.

260
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:09,434
- Well, she is.
- Do not shout at the table.

261
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:12,790
- Honey!
- Kids! Listen to your mother.

262
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,393
She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf.

263
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,919
That's it!

264
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,154
Stop it!

265
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,515
- You're gonna be toast!
- Stop running in the house.

266
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,355
Sit down!

267
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,834
- Hey, no force fields!
- You started it.

268
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,394
You sit down! You sit down!

269
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,794
Violet!

270
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,271
"Simon J. Paladino,

271
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,278
longtime advocate of superhero rights,
is missing"?

272
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,915
- Gazerbeam.
- Bob! It's time to engage.

273
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,269
Do something!
Don't just stand there!

274
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,834
- I need you to intervene!
- You want me to intervene?

275
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,951
Okay. I'm intervening!

276
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,635
Violet, let go of your brother.

277
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,199
Hello?

278
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,672
Get the door.

279
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,675
- Hey, Lucius!
- Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, Jack-Jack.

280
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,236
- Ice of you to drop by.
- Ha! Never heard that one before.

281
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,669
- Lucius!
- Whoa!

282
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,673
- Ha, ha.
- Oh!

283
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,233
- I like it when it shatters.
- I'll be back later.

284
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:24,749
- Where are you two going?
- It's Wednesday.

285
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,916
Bowling night.
Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius.

286
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:30,554
Will do. Good night, Helen.
Good night, kids.

287
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,355
Don't think you've avoided
talking about the principal's office.

288
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,549
Your father and I
are still gonna discuss it.

289
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,432
I'm not the only kid who's
been sent to the office.

290
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,356
Other kids don't have superpowers.

291
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,836
- Now, it's perfectly normal...
- What do you know about normal?

292
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,480
What does anyone
in this family know about normal?

293
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:54,354
- Now, wait a minute, young lady.
- We act normal. I wanna be normal.

294
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,233
The only normal one is Jack-Jack,
and he's not even toilet trained.

295
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,278
Lucky.

296
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,152
I meant about being normal.

297
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,997
So now I'm in deep trouble.

298
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,038
I mean, one more jolt of this
death ray and I'm an epitaph.

299
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,192
Somehow I managed to find cover.
What does Baron Von Ruthless do?

300
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:17,117
- He starts monologuing.
- He starts monologuing.

301
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,949
He starts this prepared speech
about how feeble I am compared to him.

302
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,157
How inevitable my defeat is, the world
will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada.

303
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,593
- Yammering.
- Yammering.

304
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,672
I mean, the guy has me
on a platter, and he won't shut up.

305
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:33,190
- Municiberg, we have a 23-56...
- 23-56, what is that?

306
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,435
- Robbery?
- This is just sad.

307
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,356
- Want to catch a robber?
- No.

308
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,835
Tell you the truth,
I'd rather go bowling.

309
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,238
Look, what if we actually did
what our wives think we're doing?

310
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,792
Just to shake things up.

311
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,356
He's not alone.
The fat guy's still with him.

312
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,674
They're just talking.

313
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,758
- What are we doing here?
- Protecting people.

314
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,029
- Nobody asked us.
- You need an invitation?

315
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,549
I'd like one, yes. We keep
sneaking out to do this, and...

316
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,990
- You remember Gazerbeam?
- There was something in the paper.

317
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:08,116
- He had trouble with civilian life.
- When did you see him?

318
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,596
I don't see anyone from the old days.
Just you.

319
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,789
- And we're pushing our luck as it is.
- Come on.

320
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,558
It was fun the first time,
but if we keep doing this...

321
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,876
- We have a report on a fire...
- A fire. We're close!

322
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,468
- Yeah, baby!
- We're gonna get caught.

323
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,669
Fire! Yeah!

324
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,549
- Is that everybody?
- Yeah.

325
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,156
- It better be.
- Can't you put this out?

326
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,392
I can't lay down a layer thick enough!
It's evaporating too fast!

327
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,510
- What's that mean?
- It means it's hot.

328
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,789
- I'm dehydrated, Bob.
- You're out of ice?

329
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,194
You can't run out.
You can use water in the air.

330
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:55,875
There is no water in this air!
What's your excuse, run out of muscle?

331
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,798
I can't smash walls.
The building's getting weaker.

332
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,837
- It's gonna come down on top of us.
- I wanted to go bowling!

333
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,996
All right! Stay right on my tail!
This is gonna get hot!

334
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,517
Yeah.

335
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,314
Uh-oh.

336
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,878
Oh, good.

337
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,430
That ain't right.

338
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,990
- We look like incompetent bad guys!
- You can get water out of the air.

339
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,519
Freeze!

340
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,189
Freeze!

341
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,992
- I'm thirsty.
- I said freeze!

342
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,838
I'm just getting a drink.

343
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,434
- You've had your drink. Now...
- I know. I know. Freeze.

344
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,833
Police officers!

345
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,071
That was way too close.

346
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,759
We are not doing that again.

347
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,277
Verify you want
to switch targets? Over.

348
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,756
Trust me. This is the one
he's been looking for.

349
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,790
- I thought you'd be back by 11.
- I said I'd be back later.

350
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,433
I assumed you'd be back later.
If you came back at all...

351
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:02,307
...you'd be "back later".
- Well, I'm back, okay?

352
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:10,750
Is this rubble?

353
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:14,150
It was just a little
workout. Just to stay loose.

354
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:17,635
You know how I feel about that.
Darn you! We can't blow cover again.

355
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,678
- The building was coming down anyway.
- What?

356
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,317
You knocked down a building?

357
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,192
It was on fire. Structurally unsound.
It was coming down.

358
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,634
Have you been listening
to the police scanner again?

359
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,751
I performed a public service.
You act like that's a bad thing.

360
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,192
It is a bad thing, Bob!

361
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:36,192
Uprooting our family again, so you can
relive the glory days is a bad thing.

362
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,117
It's better than acting like
they didn't happen!

363
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,474
Yes! They happened!
But this, our family,

364
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:44,996
is what's happening now, Bob.
And you are missing this!

365
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,112
I can't believe you don't want to go to
your own son's graduation.

366
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,596
It's not a graduation.
He's moving from fourth to fifth grade.

367
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,517
- It's a ceremony!
- It's psychotic!

368
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,193
They keep creating new ways
to celebrate mediocrity

369
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:58,116
but if someone is exceptional...

370
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,349
This is not about you, Bob.
It's about Dash.

371
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,113
You want to do something for Dash?
Let him actually compete.

372
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,878
- Let him go out for sports!
- I will not be made the enemy!

373
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,719
- You know why we can't do that.
- Because he'd be great.

374
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,711
This is not about you!

375
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:15,593
All right, Dash.
I know you're listening. Come on out.

376
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,869
Vi? You, too, young lady.

377
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,230
Come on. Come on out.

378
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,839
It's okay, kids.
We're just having a discussion.

379
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,597
Pretty loud discussion.

380
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,155
But that's okay. What's important
is that Mommy and I are a team.

381
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,832
- We're united, uh, against forces of...
- Pigheadedness?

382
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,348
- I was gonna say evil.
- We're sorry we woke you.

383
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,674
Everything's okay.
Go back to bed. It's late.

384
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,790
- Good night, Mom. Night, Dad.
- Good night.

385
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,151
In fact, we should all be in bed.

386
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:57,720
Request claim
on claim numbers 158183...

387
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,156
Request claim
on claim numbers 158183...

388
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,753
Haven't you got him yet?
Where is he?

389
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,314
Mr. Huph would like to talk
to you in his office.

390
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,395
- Now?
- Now.

391
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,394
Sit down, Bob.

392
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,672
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

393
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,034
- Ask me why.
- Okay. Why?

394
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,990
Why what? Be specific, Bob.

395
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,678
Why are you unhappy?

396
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,471
Your customers make me unhappy.

397
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:48,238
What, you've gotten complaints?

398
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,719
Complaints I can handle.

399
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,276
What I can't handle is your customers'
inexplicable knowledge

400
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,153
of Insuricare's inner workings!
They're experts. Experts, Bob!

401
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,238
Exploiting every loophole,
dodging every obstacle!

402
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,674
They're penetrating the bureaucracy!

403
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:05,354
- Did I do something illegal?
- No.

404
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,557
- We shouldn't help our customers?
- The law requires that I answer no.

405
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,717
- We're supposed to help people.
- Help our people!

406
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,592
Starting with our stockholders.

407
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,950
Who's helping them out, huh?

408
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,952
You know, Bob, a company...

409
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,593
Is like an enormous clock.

410
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,554
...is like an enormous...
Yes. Precisely.

411
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,076
It only works if all
the little cogs mesh together.

412
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,354
Now, a clock needs to be cleaned,
well-lubricated and wound tight.

413
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,877
The best clocks have jewel movements,
cogs that fit, that cooperate by design.

414
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,117
I'm being metaphorical, Bob.
Know what I mean by cooperative cogs?

415
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,832
Bob?

416
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,951
Bob? Look at me
when I'm talking to you, Parr.

417
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,991
- That man out there, he needs help.
- Don't change the subject.

418
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:58,838
- We're discussing your attitude.
- He is getting mugged!

419
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,513
- Well, let's hope we don't cover him.
- I'll be right back.

420
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,955
Stop right now or you're fired!

421
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,431
Close the door.

422
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,390
Get over here, now.

423
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,395
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

424
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,068
- He got away.
- Good thing, too.

425
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,667
You were this close to losing your...

426
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,673
Uh-oh.

427
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,596
Please report to
operating room 722 immediately.

428
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,633
- How is he?
- He'll live.

429
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,278
- I'm fired, aren't I?
- You think?

430
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,993
- What can I say, Rick?
- Nothing you haven't said before.

431
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,997
- Someone was in trouble.
- Always.

432
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:59,587
- I had to do something.
- Every time you say that,

433
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,715
it's a month and a half
of trouble for me.

434
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:04,035
Hundreds of thousands
of taxpayer's dollars.

435
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,594
- I know.
- We pay to keep the company quiet.

436
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,678
We pay damages, erase memories,
relocate your family.

437
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,193
Every time it gets harder.
Money, money, money.

438
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,107
We can't keep doing this. We appreciate
what you did in the old days,

439
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,391
but those days are over.
From now on, you're on your own.

440
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,798
Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you,
you know, for old times' sake.

441
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,877
I can't do that to my family.
Everyone just got settled.

442
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,115
I'll make it work. Thanks.

443
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,076
Take care of yourself.

444
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,910
What are you waiting for?

445
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,834
I don't know.
Something amazing, I guess.

446
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,673
Me, too, kid.

447
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,074
Huh?

448
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:31,598
"Hold still"?

449
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,914
Match: Mr. Incredible.

450
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,997
Room is secure. Commence message.

451
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,231
Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Yes, we know who you are.

452
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,157
Rest assured,
your secret is safe with us.

453
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:53,510
My name is Mirage.
We have something in common.

454
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,394
According to the government,
neither of us exist.

455
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,519
Please pay attention, as this message
is classified and will not be repeated.

456
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,233
I represent a top secret division
of the government,

457
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:06,634
designing and testing
experimental technology,

458
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:09,557
and we have need
of your unique abilities.

459
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,796
Something happened
at our testing facility.

460
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,239
- Honey!
- Huh? What?

461
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,549
- Dinner's ready.
- Okay.

462
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,796
...it is contained
within an isolated area,

463
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,878
it threatens to cause incalculable
damage to itself and our facilities,

464
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,633
jeopardizing hundreds
of millions of dollars...

465
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,199
Is someone in there?

466
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,392
- It's the TV, trying to watch.
- Because of its sensitive nature...

467
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,671
- Stop. It's time for dinner.
- One minute!

468
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,474
If you accept, your payment will be
triple your current annual salary.

469
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:40,275
Call the number on the card.
Voice-matching will ensure security.

470
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:44,035
The supers aren't gone, Mr. Incredible.
You're still here.

471
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,913
You can still do great things. Or...

472
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,076
...you can listen to police scanners.
Your choice.

473
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,917
You have 24 hours to respond.

474
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,519
Think about it.

475
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:32,910
This message
will self-destruct.

476
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,910
Uh-oh.

477
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:53,594
You are one distracted guy.

478
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,631
Am I? I don't mean to be.

479
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:01,231
I know you miss being a hero
and your job is frustrating.

480
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,790
I just want you to know how much it
means to me that you stay at it anyway.

481
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,387
- Honey? About the job?
- What?

482
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,589
- Something's happened.
- What?

483
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,278
- The, uh...
- What?

484
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,827
The company is sending me
to, uh, a conference.

485
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,315
- A conference?
- Out of town.

486
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,838
I'm gonna be gone for a few days.

487
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,919
They've never sent you to a conference
before. This is good, isn't it?

488
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:23,950
Yes.

489
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:27,237
You see? They're finally
recognizing your talents.

490
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,679
- You're moving up.
- Yes.

491
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,758
- Honey! This is wonderful!
- Yes, it is.

492
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,949
Hello?

493
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,911
This is Mr. Incredible.

494
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,031
I'm in.

495
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:48,593
The Omnidroid 9000
is a top secret prototype battle robot.

496
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,069
Its artificial intelligence
enables it to solve any problem

497
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,919
it's confronted with.
And, unfortunately...

498
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,430
Let me guess. It got smart enough
to wonder why it had to take orders.

499
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,996
We lost control. Now it's loose
in the jungle, threatening our facility.

500
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:05,476
We've had to evacuate all personnel
from the island for their own safety.

501
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:06,509
How am I going in?

502
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,349
The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate
an air drop from 5000 feet.

503
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,796
Its cloaking devices
make it difficult to track.

504
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,036
We're pretty sure it's on
the southern half of the island.

505
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,708
One more thing. Obviously it
represents a significant investment.

506
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,034
You want me to shut it down
without destroying it.

507
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,509
You are Mr. Incredible.

508
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,393
I've got to warn you,
it's a learning robot.

509
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:49,956
Every moment you fight it increases
its knowledge of how to beat you.

510
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,195
Shut it down. Do it quickly.
Don't destroy it.

511
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,675
- And don't die.
- Great. Thanks.

512
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,952
Showtime.

513
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,556
Huh?

514
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,074
Hmm.

515
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,833
Oh, my back!

516
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,554
Surprising. We must bring him back.

517
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:42,275
Sound the all clear,
and invite him to dinner.

518
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,038
Most important, keep things light.

519
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:06,835
Praise him. Make him feel
like we appreciate his abilities.

520
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,391
Am I overdressed?

521
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,954
Actually, you look rather dashing.

522
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,914
- I take it our host is...
- I'm sorry.

523
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:18,190
He won't be dining with us.
He hopes you'll understand.

524
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,710
Of course. I do usually make it a point
to know who I'm working for.

525
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,559
He prefers a certain amount
of anonymity.

526
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:27,068
Surely, you of all people
understand that.

527
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:31,670
I was just wondering, of all the places
to settle down, why live...

528
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,873
With a volcano? He's attracted to power.
So am I.

529
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,554
- It's a weakness we share.
- Seems a bit unstable.

530
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,717
I prefer to think of it
as misunderstood.

531
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,318
Aren't we all?

532
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,000
Volcanic soil is among
the most fertile on Earth.

533
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,077
Everything at the table
was grown right here.

534
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:54,239
- How does it compare?
- Everything's delicious.

535
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,909
- Jeez.
- Hurry, honey.

536
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:17,951
Or you'll be late for work.

537
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,436
- Have a great day, honey.
- Thanks.

538
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:24,278
- Help customers, climb ladders...
- Bring bacon.

539
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,833
All that jazz.

540
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:34,954
You have an appointment?

541
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:37,195
I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...

542
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,556
- All visitors are required...
- Go check the electric fence.

543
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,635
What is it? Who are you?
What do you want?

544
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,713
My God, you've gotten fat. Come in.
Come, come.

545
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:59,150
Yes, things are going quite well.
Quite well. My God, no complaints.

546
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,431
But, you know, it is not the same.
Not the same at all.

547
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:06,199
Weren't you in the news?
Some show in Prayge... Prague?

548
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,275
Milan, darling. Milan.

549
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,153
Supermodels.
Nothing super about them.

550
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,554
Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures

551
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,034
with poofy lips who think only
about themselves.

552
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:20,869
Feh! I used to design for gods.

553
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,554
But perhaps you come with a challenge,
eh? I was surprised to get your call.

554
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:29,353
E, I just need a patch job.

555
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,552
Hmm. This is megamesh.
Outmoded, but very sturdy.

556
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,757
And you've torn right through it!
What have you been doing, Robert?

557
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,110
Moonlighting hero work?

558
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:41,110
Must have happened a long time ago.

559
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:44,197
I see. This is a hobo suit, darling.

560
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,880
You can't be seen in this.
I won't allow it!

561
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,788
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?
- What do you mean? You designed it.

562
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,911
I never look back, darling.
It distracts from the now.

563
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:56,554
You need a new suit.
That much is certain.

564
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,034
A new suit? Where the heck
am I gonna get a new suit?

565
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,469
You can't! It's impossible!
I'm far too busy.

566
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,635
So ask me now,
before I again become sane.

567
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,478
Wait. You want to make me a suit?

568
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:09,751
You push too hard, darling!
But I accept.

569
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:12,800
- It will be bold. Dramatic!
- Yeah.

570
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,914
- Heroic!
- Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy!

571
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:21,157
Oh! He had a great look!
Oh, the cape and the boots...

572
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,190
No capes!

573
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:27,188
- Isn't that my decision?
- Do you remember Thunderhead?

574
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,992
Tall, storm powers. Nice man.
Good with kids.

575
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,798
- Listen, E...
- November 15th of '58.

576
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,307
All was well, another day saved
when his cape snagged on a missile fin.

577
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,635
Thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb...

578
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,670
Stratogale!

579
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,827
April 23rd, '57.
Cape caught in a jet turbine.

580
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,076
You can't generalize
about these things.

581
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:53,351
Meta-man. Express elevator.
Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.

582
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,431
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex.
No capes!

583
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,438
Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

584
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:02,471
You know I'm retired from hero work.

585
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,155
As am I, Robert.
Yet, here we are.

586
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,909
E, I only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

587
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:13,918
Fine. I will also fix the hobo suit.

588
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:17,793
- You're the best of the best, E.
- Yes, I know, darling. I know.

589
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,070
Don't answer it, honey, I got it!

590
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:35,833
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

591
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,476
- How soon can you get here?
- I'll leave tomorrow morning.

592
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:44,197
- See you there.
- Goodbye.

593
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,554
Who was that, honey? The, uh, office?

594
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:52,398
Another conference.
Short notice, but you know...

595
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,197
...duty calls.

596
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,751
- Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

597
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:08,155
- Ha... have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

598
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,554
- I'll call you when I get there.
- I love you.

599
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:14,797
- So much.
- I love you too.

600
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,355
This is your automated Captain.

601
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,512
Would you care for more mimosa?

602
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:35,597
- Don't mind if I do. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

603
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,476
Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.
Perfect weather for flying.

604
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,835
Please fasten your seat belt.
We're beginning our descent.

605
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:17,512
Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Nice suit.

606
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,588
Thanks.

607
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:21,996
Nice to be back, Mirage.

608
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,875
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at two.

609
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,235
- D Wing, room A-113.
- 2:00. Got it.

610
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,833
See you there.

611
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,592
Edna.

612
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,313
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
- This is Edna.

613
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,000
- E? This is Helen.
- Helen who?

614
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,192
Helen Parr? You know...

615
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:38,070
Elastigirl?

616
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:42,193
Darling! It's been such a long time
after all these years! So long!

617
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,878
It's been a while.

618
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,469
There's only one person Bob would trust
to patch his supersuit. That's you.

619
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:49,550
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it?

620
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:52,278
Much better than those horrible pajamas
he used to wear.

621
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,920
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

622
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,315
- I'm calling about...
- Don't make me beg.

623
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,114
- I won't do it, you know.
- Beg, no, I'm calling about suit.

624
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:03,958
Bob's suit!
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

625
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,708
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

626
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:21,632
Hmm.

627
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,358
It's bigger!

628
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:42,079
It's badder!

629
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:48,233
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's too much for Mr. Incredible!

630
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,829
It's finally ready.

631
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,748
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

632
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,791
but man, it wasn't good enough!

633
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,759
After you trashed the last one,
I had to make some major modifications.

634
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,952
Sure it was difficult,
but you are worth it.

635
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:10,992
I mean, after all,
I am your biggest fan.

636
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,469
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy!

637
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:17,670
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

638
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,235
That ship has sailed.
All I wanted was to help you.

639
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,755
I only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

640
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,307
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

641
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,795
It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.

642
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,036
You can't count on anyone.

643
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:34,956
Especially your heroes.

644
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:37,992
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

645
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:41,271
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

646
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,873
That's the way it works.

647
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,559
There's a lot of people,
whole countries who want respect.

648
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:48,353
And they will pay
through the nose to get it.

649
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,994
How do you think I got rich?
I invented weapons.

650
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,112
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

651
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,552
You sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

652
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:01,510
I can't believe it.

653
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:05,876
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.

654
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,918
I save the best inventions for myself.

655
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,672
Am I good enough now?

656
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:13,599
Who's super now?

657
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,472
I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and...

658
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,038
Oh, brilliant!

659
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,715
All right, try this one on
for size, big boy.

660
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:14,673
Gazerbeam.

661
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:27,391
"Kronos?"

662
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,829
Life reading negative.
Mr. Incredible terminated.

663
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,670
This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

664
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,833
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

665
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,628
Simple, elegant, yet bold.
You will die.

666
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,715
- E, I just...
- I did Robert's suit,

667
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,230
and it turned out so beautiful,
I had to continue.

668
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,068
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

669
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:23,269
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

670
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,197
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

671
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,275
That is why I show you my work.

672
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,072
That is why you are here.

673
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,469
Edna Mode.

674
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,798
And guest.

675
00:52:57,199 --> 00:52:58,791
Come. Sit.

676
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:05,677
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

677
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,313
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

678
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,188
Shh! Darling! I cut it a little
roomy for the free movement.

679
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,231
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

680
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:19,838
and can also withstand
a temperature of over 1000 degrees.

681
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:23,795
Completely bulletproof.

682
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,474
And machine washable, darling.
That's a new feature.

683
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,278
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

684
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,518
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

685
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,717
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

686
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,994
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

687
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,030
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

688
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:48,474
Your boy's suit I designed
to withstand enormous friction

689
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:52,717
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

690
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,228
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

691
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:00,639
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

692
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,038
Your suit can stretch as far as you can,
without injuring yourself,

693
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:10,913
and still retain its shape.

694
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,155
Virtually indestructible...

695
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,954
...yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.

696
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:20,315
As an extra feature, each suit contains
a homing device,

697
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,512
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

698
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,079
Well, darling? What do you think?

699
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:32,876
What do I think?
Bob is retired! I'm retired!

700
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,557
Our family is underground.

701
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:37,911
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

702
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,070
Well, I assumed you knew, darling.

703
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:42,918
Why would he keep secrets from you?

704
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:45,873
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

705
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,389
Men at Robert's age are often unstable.

706
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,715
Prone to weakness.

707
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,030
- What are you saying?
- Do you know where he is?

708
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,317
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

709
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,150
- Hey, hey. We got a man down!
- Come on, let's go.

710
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,034
Are you okay? What happened?

711
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:40,197
Break surveillance
and engage. Continuing sweep...

712
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:20,391
- Insuricare.
- Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr.

713
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,391
Bob Parr is my husband.
I was wondering if you could give me

714
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:27,478
the number of the hotel he's staying at?
The number I have is no good.

715
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,318
- Mr. Parr no longer works here.
- What do you mean?

716
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,833
He's on a business trip.
A company retreat.

717
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,757
My records say he was terminated
almost two months ago.

718
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,233
So, you don't know where he is.

719
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:13,351
Would you like to find out?

720
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:29,592
I am such an idiot.

721
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:31,914
I let this happen, you know.

722
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,788
The new sports car, the getting
in shape, the blond hair, the lies.

723
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,992
Yes, he attempts to relive the past.

724
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,635
Now I'm losing him! What'll I do?
What'll I do?

725
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,353
What are you talking about?

726
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:50,757
You are Elastigirl! My God!
Pull yourself together.

727
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,835
What will you do?
Is this a question?

728
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,268
Show him you remember
that he is Mr. Incredible,

729
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,237
and you will remind him who you are!

730
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:02,672
Well, you know where he is.
Go! Confront the problem! Fight! Win!

731
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,429
And call me when you get back, darling.
I enjoy our visits.

732
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,869
There's lots of leftovers
that you can reheat.

733
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,833
Make sure Dash does his homework.
And both of you, get to bed on time.

734
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,677
I should be back tonight. Late.

735
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,755
You can be in charge that long,
can't you?

736
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,440
Yeah. But why am I in charge again?

737
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:21,869
Nothing.
Just a little trouble with Daddy.

738
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,197
You mean Dad's in trouble,
or Dad is the trouble?

739
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,989
I mean either he's in trouble,
or he's going to be.

740
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,427
What's that?
Where'd you get that, Mom?

741
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,630
You made a cool outfit?
Hey, are those for us?

742
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,114
We all get cool outfits?

743
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:45,753
Dash! You come back here this moment!

744
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:49,474
Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back.

745
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,956
I know this is short notice,
but I was hoping that I could...

746
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:55,878
- What are these?
- Look, I'm The Dash!

747
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,594
- The Dash likes.
- Just a second.

748
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:02,349
- Take that off before somebody sees.
- You're packing one just like it.

749
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,273
- Are you hiding something?
- Please. I'm on the phone...

750
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,436
- Dash!
- This is yours. It's specially made.

751
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:10,717
- What's going on?
- You're not coming! I gotta pack!

752
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,717
What makes you think it's special?

753
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,592
I don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it?

754
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:29,077
Snug, I'm calling
in a solid you owe me.

755
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:32,469
- What do you need?
- A jet. What do you got that's fast?

756
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:34,157
Let me think.

757
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,713
Island approach.
India Golf niner-niner checking in.

758
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,190
VFR on top. Over.

759
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,032
Island tower,
this is India Golf niner-niner

760
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,907
Requesting vectors to the initial.

761
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:08,034
Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl.

762
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:12,516
You're overreacting. Everything's fine.
They're just all getting coffee.

763
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:17,431
At the same time. Yeah.

764
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,434
You sir, truly are "Mr. Incredible".

765
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,356
I was right to idolize you.

766
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,835
I always knew you were tough,
but tricking the probe

767
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,713
by hiding under the bones
of another super? Oh, man!

768
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,030
I'm still geeking out about it!

769
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:48,751
And then you had
to just go and ruin the ride.

770
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:53,594
I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help?
"Help me, help me."

771
01:03:53,719 --> 01:03:55,949
Lame, lame, lame.

772
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:00,550
- All right, who did you contact?
- Contact? What are you talking about?

773
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:07,753
I am referring to last night
at 2307 hours

774
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,797
while you were snooping around.
You sent out a homing signal.

775
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,831
I didn't know about the homing device.

776
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:22,351
And now a government plane
is requesting permission to land here.

777
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,398
- Who did you contact?
- I didn't send for a plane.

778
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:27,237
Play the transmission.

779
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:31,835
- India golf checking in.
- Helen!

780
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,996
So you do know these people.

781
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,719
Well, then, I'll send them
a little greeting.

782
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,112
- Ow!
- Violet!

783
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,355
It's not my fault.

784
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,710
Dash ran away,
I knew I'd get blamed for it.

785
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,278
That's not true!

786
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,197
You said, "Something's up with Mom.
We have to find out what.

787
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,670
...and it's not my fault!
- Hundred percent all-yours idea!

788
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,632
Wait a minute.
You left Jack-Jack alone?

789
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,398
- Of course we got a sitter.
- We got someone, Mom.

790
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:01,715
- We wouldn't do that.
- Thanks a lot!

791
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:04,797
All right, well, who'd you get?

792
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,150
You don't have to worry
about one thing.

793
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:10,471
I've got baby-sitting wired.
I've taken courses, learned CPR,

794
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:13,717
- Excellent marks and certificates.
- Kari.

795
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,876
I brought Mozart to play while he sleeps

796
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,833
because leading experts say
Mozart makes babies smarter.

797
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,949
Kari...

798
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:22,833
The beauty is they don't have to listen
'cause they're asleep!

799
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,672
I wish my parents played Mozart

800
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,791
because half the time I don't know
what anyone's talking about.

801
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,150
Kari, I really don't feel
comfortable with this.

802
01:05:31,239 --> 01:05:34,231
I'll pay you for your trouble,
but I'd rather call a service.

803
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,077
There's really no need, Mrs. Parr.

804
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:38,713
I can totally handle anything
this baby can dish out.

805
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,434
Can't I, little baby?
I can handle it.

806
01:05:41,559 --> 01:05:43,436
Who can handle it?

807
01:05:50,599 --> 01:05:53,398
India Golf niner-niner transmitting
in the blind guard.

808
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,277
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.

809
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,675
Repeat, disengage.
Friendlies...

810
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,916
No! Call off the missiles.
I'll do anything.

811
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,750
Too late. Fifteen years too late.

812
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,637
Friendlies two-zero miles
south-southwest of your position.

813
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,114
Angels 10. Track east. Disengage.

814
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:41,753
Vi! Put a force field around the plane.

815
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,472
You said not to use our powers.

816
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:45,755
I know what I said.
Listen to what I'm saying now!

817
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,916
Disengage. Repeat, disengage!

818
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,034
- Mom?
- Violet!

819
01:06:55,159 --> 01:06:58,038
Mayday. India Golf niner-niner
is buddy-spiked. Abort!

820
01:06:58,159 --> 01:06:59,559
There are children aboard.

821
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:03,467
- There are children aboard!
- No!

822
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:06,393
- Put a field around us now!
- I've never done one that big.

823
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,389
Do it now!

824
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,034
Abort, abort, abort!

825
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,793
Abort, abort, abort!

826
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,552
Brace yourselves!

827
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:54,438
- Mom!
- Everybody calm down.

828
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,436
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.

829
01:07:56,519 --> 01:07:58,875
We're not gonna panic,
we're not... Look out!

830
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,432
- Oh, my God! Who's idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

831
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:14,596
We're dead! We're dead!

832
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:17,280
- It blew up!
- We survived but we're dead!

833
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,510
Stop it!

834
01:08:19,639 --> 01:08:21,391
We are not gonna die!

835
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,192
Both of you will get a grip.

836
01:08:23,319 --> 01:08:25,595
Or so help me
I will ground you for a month!

837
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,431
Understand?

838
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:31,788
We have a confirmed hit.
Target was destroyed.

839
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,751
Ah, you'll get over it.

840
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:37,435
I seem to recall
you prefer to "work alone".

841
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,114
Release me. Now!

842
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:52,271
- Or what?
- I'll crush her.

843
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,913
That sounds a little dark for you.
Well, go ahead.

844
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:57,792
It'll be easy.
Like breaking a toothpick.

845
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,511
Show me.

846
01:09:11,479 --> 01:09:13,630
I knew you couldn't do it.

847
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,796
Even when you have nothing to lose.

848
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,438
You're weak.

849
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,470
And I've outgrown you.

850
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,918
Those were short-range missiles.
Land-based.

851
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:35,631
That way is our best bet.

852
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,512
You want to go toward
the people that tried to kill us?

853
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,519
- If it means land, yes.
- Do you expect us to swim there?

854
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,676
I expect you to trust me.

855
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,956
What a trooper.

856
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:48,070
I'm so proud of you.

857
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:50,157
Thanks, Mom.

858
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,512
I think your father is in trouble.

859
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,279
If you haven't noticed,
we're not doing so hot either.

860
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,635
I'm going to look for him.

861
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,354
And that means you're in charge
until I get back, Violet.

862
01:11:05,479 --> 01:11:07,550
- What?
- You heard her.

863
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:13,315
Put these on. Your identity
is your most valuable possession.

864
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:14,389
Protect it.

865
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,193
And if anything goes wrong,
use your powers.

866
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:19,833
- But you said never to use...
- I know what I said!

867
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:27,318
Remember the bad guys on those shows
you used to watch on Saturday mornings?

868
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:30,716
Well, these guys
are not like those guys.

869
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,195
They won't exercise restraint
because you're children.

870
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:37,311
They will kill you
if they get the chance.

871
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:39,430
Do not give them that chance.

872
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,595
- Mom?
- Vi, I'm counting on you.

873
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:45,434
- There's...
- I'm counting on you. Be strong.

874
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:49,637
Dash, if anything goes wrong,
I want you to run as fast as you can.

875
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,149
- As fast as I can?
- As fast as you can.

876
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:56,438
Stay hidden. Keep each other safe.
I'll be back by morning.

877
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,193
Mom!

878
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,792
Mom, what happened on the plane.
I'm sorry.

879
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,150
I wanted to help.
When you asked me to... I'm sorry.

880
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:09,917
Shh. It isn't your fault.

881
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,675
It wasn't fair for me to suddenly
ask so much of you.

882
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,029
But things are different now.

883
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:19,073
And doubt is a luxury
we can't afford anymore, sweetie.

884
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,555
You have more power than you realize.

885
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,034
Don't think. And don't worry.

886
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:26,548
If the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

887
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,954
It's in your blood.

888
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,028
He's not weak, you know.

889
01:13:07,159 --> 01:13:08,149
What?

890
01:13:08,279 --> 01:13:10,430
Valuing life is not weakness.

891
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,996
Hey. Look, if you're talking about
what happened in the containment unit,

892
01:13:14,119 --> 01:13:15,997
I had everything under control.

893
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:18,680
And disregarding it is not strength.

894
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,359
I called his bluff, sweetheart,
that's all.

895
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:23,835
I knew he wouldn't have it in him
to actually...

896
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,752
Next time you gamble,
bet your own life!

897
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,430
Okay, okay, okay.

898
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:37,032
A rocket?

899
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:30,595
Hey!

900
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:30,350
Well, not that this isn't fun,
but I'm gonna go look around.

901
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:34,234
What do you think is going on here?
You think we're on vacation?

902
01:16:34,359 --> 01:16:37,033
Mom and Dad's lives
could be in jeopardy.

903
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,515
Or worse, their marriage.

904
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,470
Their marriage?

905
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,957
So, the bad guys are trying to wreck
Mom and Dad's marriage.

906
01:16:46,039 --> 01:16:48,076
Forget it. You're so immature.

907
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:51,192
- I'm gonna go look around.
- Mom said to stay hidden.

908
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:55,313
I'm not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh.

909
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,791
Cool!

910
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:37,030
Cool!

911
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:39,314
Roger.
We are ready for launch.

912
01:17:49,079 --> 01:17:52,550
- Vi, Vi!
- What did you do?

913
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,557
ETA two-niner. Over.

914
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,996
TCI clear. Condition yellow.
Status norm.

915
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:16,717
Not responding to IFF.

916
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,989
IRCM reads negative.

917
01:18:20,319 --> 01:18:21,877
- Bob.
- What?

918
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,114
I didn't say anything.

919
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,479
Identification, please.

920
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,319
- Hey! Hey, Violet! Come here, look.
- What?

921
01:18:56,439 --> 01:18:57,429
- It talks!
- What?

922
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,787
There. That one.

923
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,393
Voice key incorrect.

924
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,993
- "Voice key"?
- Voice key incorrect.

925
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:06,632
Wait a second.

926
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:10,037
- What do we do?
- Run!

927
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,150
- Where are we going?
- Away from here!

928
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,234
Intruder alert.

929
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,871
- There isn't much time.
- No, there isn't.

930
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,115
In fact, there's no time at all.

931
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,230
- Please...
- Why are you here?

932
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:53,074
How can you possibly bring me lower?
What more can you take away from me?

933
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:56,795
Family survived the crash.

934
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,752
- They're here on the island!
- They're alive?

935
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,949
- Helen?
- Hello.

936
01:20:15,079 --> 01:20:17,229
You must be Mrs...

937
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,109
- She was helping me to escape.
- No.

938
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:21,672
That's what I was doing.

939
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,078
Let go of me!

940
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:26,078
Let go, you lousy, lying,
unfaithful creep!

941
01:20:27,399 --> 01:20:29,833
How could I betray the perfect woman?

942
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,877
- Oh, you're referring to me now?
- Where are the kids?

943
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,796
- They triggered the alert.
- What?

944
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,030
- Security's in the jungle. Get going.
- Our kids are in danger?

945
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:40,310
If you suspected danger,
why'd you bring them?

946
01:20:40,439 --> 01:20:42,475
They stowed away.
You're not striking the proper tone.

947
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,395
- Think they're supers?
- Dash, remember what Mom said.

948
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,998
- What?
- Stop talking!

949
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:58,872
- Hold it! Freeze!
- Dash, run!

950
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,672
- What?
- Run!

951
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:04,319
- They're supers!
- Get the boy!

952
01:21:05,399 --> 01:21:06,798
Show yourself!

953
01:22:05,079 --> 01:22:06,354
Hey!

954
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:14,628
Ha, ha!

955
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:32,155
I'm alive. Yeah!

956
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,474
I should've told you I was fired,
I admit it.

957
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,192
But I didn't want you to worry.

958
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:47,594
You didn't want me to worry?

959
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,439
We're running for our lives
through some godforsaken jungle.

960
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,551
You keep trying to pick a fight,
but I'm just happy you're alive.

961
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,319
I know you're there,
Little Miss Disappear.

962
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:12,157
You can't hide from me.

963
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:20,395
- There you are.
- Hey!

964
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,875
Don't touch my sister!

965
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,916
- How are you doing that?
- I don't know!

966
01:24:36,039 --> 01:24:37,519
Whatever you do, don't stop!

967
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:55,032
Mom! Dad! Hey!

968
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,108
Kids.

969
01:24:58,239 --> 01:24:59,992
- You're all right.
- You're all right.

970
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:02,673
- We were so worried.
- I thought I'd never see you again.

971
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:21,752
I love you.

972
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,279
- Wow.
- Whoa.

973
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,278
Time out!

974
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:43,037
What have we here?
Matching uniforms?

975
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:48,350
Oh, no! Elastigirl?

976
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,189
You married Elastigirl? Whoa!

977
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:55,149
And got busy!

978
01:25:55,279 --> 01:25:57,840
It's a whole family of supers.

979
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,029
Looks like I've hit the jackpot!

980
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:02,390
Oh, this is just too good!

981
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:05,829
- The ship's unique design...
- There were no fatalities...

982
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:10,670
Huh? Huh? Oh, come on!
You gotta admit, this is cool.

983
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,872
Just like a movie!
The robot will emerge dramatically,

984
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,719
do some damage.
Throngs of screaming people!

985
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:21,435
And just when all hope is lost,
Syndrome will save the day!

986
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,948
I'll be a bigger hero
than you ever were!

987
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:27,833
You mean you killed off real heroes
so that you could pretend to be one?

988
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,229
Oh, I'm real.
Real enough to defeat you!

989
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:34,875
And I did it without your precious
gifts, your oh-so-special powers.

990
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,274
I'll give them heroics.

991
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:39,358
I'll give them the most spectacular
heroics anyone's ever seen!

992
01:26:39,479 --> 01:26:42,711
And when I'm old and I've had my fun,
I'll sell my inventions

993
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:47,032
so that everyone can be superheroes.
Everyone can be super.

994
01:26:47,159 --> 01:26:49,878
And when everyone's super...

995
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:53,832
...no one will be.

996
01:27:18,439 --> 01:27:20,270
Fire at will!

997
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:30,077
It's overwhelming the tanks.

998
01:27:30,199 --> 01:27:31,679
I'm sorry.

999
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,594
This is my fault.
I've been a lousy father.

1000
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:39,189
Blind to what I have.
So obsessed with being undervalued

1001
01:27:39,319 --> 01:27:42,198
- That I undervalued all of you.
- Dad?

1002
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:43,389
Shh. Don't interrupt.

1003
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,079
So caught up in the past that I...

1004
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,274
You are my greatest adventure.
And I almost missed it.

1005
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:54,311
I swear, I'm gonna get us
out of this safely if I...

1006
01:27:54,439 --> 01:27:58,069
Well, I think Dad has made
some excellent progress today

1007
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:00,673
but I think it's time we wind down now.

1008
01:28:03,399 --> 01:28:05,152
We need to get back to the mainland.

1009
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:07,713
I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in.
Straight ahead.

1010
01:28:17,319 --> 01:28:18,877
Where are all the guards?

1011
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,359
Go, go!

1012
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:27,072
Hey, every time they run,
you take a shot.

1013
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:45,154
This is the right hangar,
but I don't see any jets.

1014
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:48,158
- A jet's not fast enough.
- What's faster than a jet?

1015
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,070
How about a rocket?

1016
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:56,878
- Great! I can't fly a rocket.
- You don't have to.

1017
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,514
Use the coordinates
from the last launch.

1018
01:29:01,319 --> 01:29:04,789
Wait. I bet Syndrome's changed
the password by now.

1019
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,519
- How do I get into the computer?
- Say please.

1020
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:24,516
- Honey?
- What?

1021
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,470
- Where is my supersuit?
- What?

1022
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,909
Where is my supersuit?

1023
01:29:30,039 --> 01:29:32,872
- I put it away.
- Where?

1024
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,229
Why do you need to know?

1025
01:29:35,359 --> 01:29:36,314
I need it!

1026
01:29:36,439 --> 01:29:39,351
Don't you think about
running off doing no derrin'-do.

1027
01:29:39,439 --> 01:29:41,873
We've been planning
this dinner for two months!

1028
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,639
- The public is in danger!
- My evening's in danger!

1029
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:48,149
Tell me where my suit is, woman!
We are talking about the greater good.

1030
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,230
"Greater good"? I am your wife!

1031
01:29:50,319 --> 01:29:52,355
I'm the greatest good
you are ever gonna get!

1032
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,913
Run!

1033
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:00,913
My baby!

1034
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:07,349
- The supers have returned!
- Is that Fironic?

1035
01:30:07,479 --> 01:30:10,869
- Fironic?
- No, Fironic has a different outfit.

1036
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:15,430
No, no, I'm a new superhero!
I'm Syndrome!

1037
01:30:18,439 --> 01:30:19,713
All right, stand back.

1038
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:28,356
Someone needs to teach
this hunk of metal a few manners.

1039
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,034
Ha, ha!

1040
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,509
- Are we there yet?
- We get there when we get there.

1041
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,636
How you doing, honey?

1042
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:07,399
Do I have to answer?

1043
01:31:09,479 --> 01:31:12,471
Kids, strap yourselves down
like I told you.

1044
01:31:16,279 --> 01:31:18,157
Here we go, honey.

1045
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:22,115
Ready, Violet? Ready?

1046
01:31:22,199 --> 01:31:23,234
Now!

1047
01:31:26,199 --> 01:31:27,599
This is gonna be rough.

1048
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,989
Robot's in the financial district.
Which exit?

1049
01:31:37,119 --> 01:31:39,270
- Traction Avenue.
- That'll take me downtown.

1050
01:31:39,399 --> 01:31:41,755
- I take Seventh, don't I?
- Don't take Seventh!

1051
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:44,394
- Great, we missed it.
- Ask how to get there, I told you.

1052
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,271
- Traction.
- That'll take me downtown.

1053
01:31:46,359 --> 01:31:47,952
Get in the right lane! Signal!

1054
01:31:48,079 --> 01:31:50,115
- Not Traction!
- You're gonna miss it!

1055
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:18,279
Is everybody okay back there?

1056
01:32:18,359 --> 01:32:21,750
- Super-duper, Dad!
- Let's do that again.

1057
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:27,356
Wait here and stay hidden.
I'm going in.

1058
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:30,720
While what?
I watch helplessly from the sidelines?

1059
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,434
- I don't think so.
- I'm asking you to wait with the kids.

1060
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:35,835
And I'm telling you not a chance.
You're my husband.

1061
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,631
I'm with you for better or worse.

1062
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,671
I have to do this alone.

1063
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,471
- What is this to you? Playtime?
- No.

1064
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:43,515
- So you can be Mr. Incredible again?
- No!

1065
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:45,073
- Then what?
- I'm not...

1066
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:46,837
- Not what?
- I'm not strong enough.

1067
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,791
- This will make you stronger?
- Yes. No!

1068
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,876
That's what this is?
Some sort of workout?

1069
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,309
I can't lose you again!

1070
01:32:54,359 --> 01:32:57,033
I can't. Not again.

1071
01:32:57,159 --> 01:32:59,390
I'm not... strong enough.

1072
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:10,313
If we work together,
you won't have to be.

1073
01:33:10,439 --> 01:33:12,158
I don't know what'll happen.

1074
01:33:12,279 --> 01:33:13,872
We're superheroes.
What can happen?

1075
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,591
Vi! Dash! No!

1076
01:33:30,279 --> 01:33:31,189
Violet?

1077
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,868
- Dad!
- Go, go!

1078
01:33:46,199 --> 01:33:49,430
- I'm okay, Mom. Really.
- Stay here, okay?

1079
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,118
Frozone!

1080
01:34:01,239 --> 01:34:05,153
Yeah!

1081
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:06,269
Bob!

1082
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:08,270
Hey!

1083
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:25,074
Syndrome's remote!

1084
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:36,675
The remote controls the robot!

1085
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:41,668
- Throw it, throw it!
- Go long!

1086
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:53,515
Got it!

1087
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:00,195
Honey, take out its guns!

1088
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:08,715
Gotcha!

1089
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:54,037
Mom, I've got it! I've got the remote!

1090
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,949
A remote? A remote that controls what?

1091
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:02,155
The robot?

1092
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:13,390
It's coming back!

1093
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:16,390
- That wasn't right.
- Give me that!

1094
01:36:17,279 --> 01:36:20,430
We can't stop it. The only thing
hard enough to penetrate it is...

1095
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,029
...itself.

1096
01:36:25,159 --> 01:36:26,559
It's getting closer!

1097
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,636
- It doesn't work!
- Kids!

1098
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:31,877
It's not doing anything.

1099
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,115
- Try to buy us some time.
- Try the one next to it.

1100
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:39,914
Honey!

1101
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,074
Wait a minute.
Press that button again!

1102
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:53,432
- No, the other one! The first one!
- First button! Got it!

1103
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:55,755
- It's getting closer!
- Look out!

1104
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:58,434
- Get out of here!
- We're not going anywhere.

1105
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,152
- Press the button!
- Not yet!

1106
01:37:00,279 --> 01:37:02,588
- Hang on!
- What are you waiting for?

1107
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,836
A closer target! You got one shot!

1108
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:09,672
Everybody duck!

1109
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:32,755
Hey, Zone.

1110
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:40,869
Huh? No!

1111
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:44,838
Did you see that?
That's the way to do it.

1112
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:48,872
- That's old school.
- Yeah. No school like the old school.

1113
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:54,837
- Just like old times. Oh!
- Just like old times.

1114
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:56,716
Yeah. Hurt then too.

1115
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:02,269
We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets.

1116
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:05,789
If he even sneezes, we'll be there
with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs.

1117
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,149
The people of this country
are indebted to you.

1118
01:38:08,279 --> 01:38:10,032
Does this mean we can
come out of hiding?

1119
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:11,990
Let the politicians figure that one out.

1120
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:15,430
I've been asked to assure you
we'll take care of everything else.

1121
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:16,675
You did good, Bob.

1122
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,551
Hi, this is Kari.

1123
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:21,399
I have a question about Jack-Jack...

1124
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,192
Come on. We're in a limo.

1125
01:38:23,319 --> 01:38:26,038
Hey, you're wearing your hair back?

1126
01:38:26,119 --> 01:38:28,838
- Yeah, I just... yeah.
- It looks good.

1127
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:31,427
- Thanks, Dad.
- That was cool when you threw that car!

1128
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:33,948
Not as cool as you running on water.

1129
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:37,390
That was sweet when you
snagged that bad guy with your arm

1130
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:40,238
and whiplashed him into the other guy.
Sweet!

1131
01:38:40,359 --> 01:38:42,998
- I'm trying to listen to messages.
- It's me.

1132
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:46,475
Jack-Jack is fine,
but weird things are happening.

1133
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:49,989
Jack-Jack's still fine,
but I'm getting really weirded out!

1134
01:38:50,079 --> 01:38:51,592
When are you coming back?

1135
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,954
...aced those guys
that tried to kill us!

1136
01:38:54,079 --> 01:38:57,913
That was the best vacation ever!
I love our family.

1137
01:38:58,039 --> 01:39:00,759
I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr!

1138
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:03,479
Put that down! Stop it!
You need to call me.

1139
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,676
I need help, Mrs...

1140
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,318
Bob, listen to this.

1141
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:09,350
I'm gonna call the police...

1142
01:39:09,439 --> 01:39:10,838
Hi, this is Kari.

1143
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:14,953
Sorry for freaking out,
but your baby has special needs.

1144
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:16,951
Thanks for sending a replacement.

1145
01:39:17,079 --> 01:39:19,640
I didn't call a replacement.

1146
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:27,115
Shh. The baby is sleeping.

1147
01:39:29,479 --> 01:39:31,595
You took away my future.

1148
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:34,951
I'm simply returning the favor.
Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor.

1149
01:39:35,039 --> 01:39:38,190
Supportive, encouraging.
Everything you weren't.

1150
01:39:38,279 --> 01:39:42,033
And in time, who knows,
he might make a good sidekick.

1151
01:39:46,039 --> 01:39:49,157
He's getting away, Bob!
We have to do something now.

1152
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:05,512
What's happening?

1153
01:40:11,239 --> 01:40:14,198
- Stop him! Throw something!
- I might hit Jack-Jack.

1154
01:40:18,279 --> 01:40:19,679
Throw me.

1155
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:24,993
Bob, throw me!

1156
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:31,988
No!

1157
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,916
This isn't the end of it!
I will get your son, eventually.

1158
01:40:38,039 --> 01:40:39,268
I'll get your son!

1159
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,069
Oh, no.

1160
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,628
Look at Mommy, honey.
Don't look down. Mommy's got you.

1161
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:59,149
Everything is all right.

1162
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,033
That's my girl.

1163
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:18,314
Does this mean we have to move again?

1164
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:22,679
Oh, man.

1165
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:25,432
That was totally wicked!

1166
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,479
Do we have to have cheerleaders
at the track meet?

1167
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:47,478
- What is that all about?
- I always thought it was more...

1168
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,033
- Hey.
- Hey.

1169
01:41:49,159 --> 01:41:51,594
- You're, uh, Violet, right?
- That's me.

1170
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:53,471
- See you, Vi.
- You look different.

1171
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:56,751
I feel different. Is different okay?

1172
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:59,912
Hey, different is...
Different is great.

1173
01:42:00,039 --> 01:42:02,189
Would you...

1174
01:42:02,279 --> 01:42:03,792
- Yeah?
- Do you think maybe...

1175
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:05,671
...you and I...
- Yeah?

1176
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,028
- Do you...
- Shh.

1177
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:09,759
I like movies.
I'll buy the popcorn. Okay?

1178
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:13,509
A movie.
There you go. Yeah.

1179
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:16,313
- Wait, so Friday?
- Friday.

1180
01:42:20,199 --> 01:42:23,158
- Go, Dash, go.
- Run!

1181
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:25,555
Come on, run! Pick up the pace.

1182
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,868
Run!

1183
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,274
Move it, move it!

1184
01:42:28,359 --> 01:42:31,033
Pace it.
Slow down just a little bit.

1185
01:42:31,159 --> 01:42:33,878
- Make it close!
- Second.

1186
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:36,154
Close second, yeah!

1187
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,795
That's my boy!

1188
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,989
Dash, I'm so proud of you.

1189
01:42:44,119 --> 01:42:46,554
I didn't know what the heck
you wanted me to do.

1190
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,717
Behold the Underminer!

1191
01:43:01,279 --> 01:43:03,588
I am always beneath you,

1192
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:07,076
but nothing is beneath me!

1193
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:12,796
I hereby declare war
on peace and happiness!

1194
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:17,277
Soon all will tremble before me!
