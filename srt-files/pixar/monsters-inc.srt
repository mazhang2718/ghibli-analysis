1
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,014
-Good night, sweetheart.
-'Night, Mom.

2
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,515
Sleep tight, kiddo.

3
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,523
Simulation terminated.

4
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,733
Simulation terminated.

5
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:16,237
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.

6
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,656
Simulation terminated.

7
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:23,619
-All right. Mr. Bile, is it?
-My friends call me Phlegm.

8
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,206
Mr. Bile, can you tell me
what you did wrong?

9
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,626
-I fell down?
-No, no, before that.

10
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,130
Can anyone tell me
Mr. Bile's big mistake?

11
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,299
Anyone?

12
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,970
Let's take a look at the tape.
Here we go.

13
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,890
Right there.

14
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,517
See? The door.
You left it wide open.

15
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,563
And leaving the door open
is the worst mistake

16
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,816
any employee can make because...

17
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,821
-It could let in a draft?
-It could let in a child.

18
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,324
Mr. Waternoose.

19
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:06,245
There's nothing more toxic or deadly
than a human child.

20
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,706
A single touch could kill you.

21
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,502
Leave a door open and a child
could walk right into this factory,

22
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,254
right into the monster world.

23
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,798
I won't go in a kid's room.
You can't make me.

24
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,052
You're going in there
because we need this.

25
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:31,771
Our city is counting on you
to collect those children's screams.

26
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,649
Without scream we have no power.

27
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,817
Yes, it's dangerous work.

28
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,779
And that's why I need you
to be at your best.

29
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,658
I need scarers who are
confident, tenacious, tough.

30
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,493
Intimidating.

31
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:51,123
I need scarers like...
Like James P. Sullivan.

32
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:51,207
I need scarers like...
Like James P. Sullivan.

33
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,297
Hey, good morning, Monstropolis.
It's five after 6:00 a.m.

34
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,132
in the big Monster City.

35
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,928
The temperature's a balmy 65 degrees
which is good for you reptiles.

36
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:08,057
And it looks like it's gonna be
a perfect day to lie in bed, sleep in,

37
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,687
or simply work off that flab
that's hanging over the bed!

38
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,355
Get up, Sulley!

39
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,985
I don't believe I ordered
a wake-up call, Mikey.

40
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,654
Less talk, more pain,
marshmallow boy!

41
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,032
Feel the burn.
You call yourself a monster?

42
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,660
Scary feet, scary feet.
The kid's awake!

43
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,454
Scary feet, scary feet, scary feet.
Kid's asleep!

44
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,833
Twins! In a bunk bed!

45
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,211
I thought I had you there.

46
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,923
OK, Sulley, here we go.
You ready? Follow it. It's over here.

47
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,552
Over there. Don't let the kid touch you.
Don't let him touch you!

48
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,055
I don't know but it's been said
I love scarin' kids in bed

49
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,517
Fight that plaque.
Scary monsters don't have plaque.

50
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,936
One-eighteen. Do you have 119?

51
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,646
Do I see 120?

52
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,399
-I don't believe it.
-I'm not breaking a sweat.

53
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,860
Not you. Look!
The new commercial's on.

54
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,947
The future is bright
at Monsters, Incorporated.

55
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,199
-I'm in this one.
-We're part of your life.

56
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,077
We power your car.
We warm your home.

57
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,871
We light your city.

58
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,832
-I'm Monsters, Incorporated.
-Hey, look! Betty!

59
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,377
Carefully matching every child
to their ideal monster,

60
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,546
to produce superior scream.

61
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,466
Refined into clean,
dependable energy.

62
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:28,220
Every time you turn something on,
Monsters, Incorporated is there.

63
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,766
-I'm Monsters, Incorporated.
-We know the challenge.

64
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,851
The window of innocence is shrinking.

65
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,437
Human kids are harder to scare.

66
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,065
Of course,
Ml is prepared for the future.

67
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,067
With the top scarers,

68
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,818
the best refineries,

69
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,613
and research into
new energy techniques.

70
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,157
OK, here I come.

71
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,743
We're working for a better tomorrow,

72
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,413
-today.
-We're Monsters, Incorporated.

73
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,416
We're MI, Monsters, Incorporated.

74
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,252
We scare because we care.

75
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,090
-I can't believe it.
-Mike.

76
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,467
I was on TV!

77
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,803
Did you see me? I'm a natural.

78
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,139
Hello?
I know! Wasn't I great?

79
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,767
Did the whole family see it?
It's your mom.

80
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,685
What can I say?
The camera loves me.

81
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,451
I'm telling you, you're gonna
be seeing this face on TV more often.

82
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,162
Yeah? On Monstropolis' Most Wanted?

83
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,250
You've been jealous of my good looks
since the fourth grade.

84
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,544
-Have a good day, sweetie.
-You too, hon.

85
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,631
-OK, Sulley, hop on in.
-Nope.

86
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,926
-Hey, where you going?
-Mikey, there's a scream shortage.

87
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,719
-We're walking.
-Walking?

88
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,638
-No, no.
-Come on.

89
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,223
My baby needs to be driven.

90
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,851
My baby. I'll call you.

91
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:56,892
My baby. I'll call you.

92
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,230
-You know why I bought the car?
-Not really.

93
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,525
To drive it. You know,
on the street with the honk, honk,

94
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,445
-no walking involved.
-Give it a rest, will ya, butterball?

95
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,907
-You could use the exercise.
-I could use the exercise? Look at you.

96
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,701
You have your own climate.

97
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,287
-How many tentacles jump the rope?
-How many tentacles jump the rope?

98
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,164
Morning, Mike. Morning, Sulley.

99
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,124
Morning, kids. How you doing?

100
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:24,128
-Hi, Mike. Bye, Sulley.
-Hey!

101
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,553
Nuts.

102
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:32,803
Nuts.

103
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,391
-Fellas.
-Hey, Tony.

104
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,186
Tony, Tony.

105
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,106
I hear somebody's close to breaking
the all-time scare record.

106
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:48,277
Just trying to make sure
there's enough scream to go around.

107
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,071
-Hey, on the house.
-Hey, thanks.

108
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,489
Bada-bing.

109
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,660
Oh, great.

110
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,206
Hey, Ted, good morning.

111
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,961
See that, Mikey?
Ted's walking to work.

112
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,881
Big deal.
Guy takes five steps and he's there.

113
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,723
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

114
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,851
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

115
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,394
-Mornin', Sulley.
-Mornin', Ricky.

116
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,855
-It's the Sullster.
-See you on the scare floor.

117
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,900
-Hey Marge. How was jury duty?
-Morning, Sulley.

118
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,109
Hey.

119
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,904
Hey. It's still leaning to the left.

120
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,740
-It is not.
-Hey, fellas. Hey, Jerry.

121
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,827
-Hey, Mr. Sullivan.
-Guys, I told you, call me Sulley.

122
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,207
-I don't think so.
-We want to wish you good luck today.

123
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,127
Hey, hey, get lost, you two.
You're making him lose his focus.

124
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,046
-Sorry.
-See you later, fellas.

125
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,756
Go get 'em, Mr. Sullivan.

126
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,259
Quiet.
You're making him lose his focus.

127
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,262
-Oh, no. Sorry!
-Shut up!

128
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,974
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. I'll connect you.

129
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,143
Miss Fearmonger is on vacation.
Would you like her voicemail?

130
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,772
-Schmoopsie-pooh.
-Googly bear.

131
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:11,360
-Happy birthday.
-Googly-woogly, you remembered.

132
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:15,364
-Hey, Sulley-wulley.
-Hey, Celia-wheelia.

133
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,033
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

134
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,370
So are we going
anywhere special tonight?

135
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,916
I just got us into a little place
called Harryhausen's.

136
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:30,254
Harryhausen's? But it's impossible
to get a reservation there.

137
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,799
Not for googly bear.
I will see you at quittin' time.

138
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,968
-Not a minute later.
-OK, sweetheart.

139
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,886
Think romantical thoughts.

140
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,307
You and me
Me and you

141
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,225
Both of us together

142
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,811
You know, pal, she's the one.

143
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,689
-That's it. She is the one.
-I'm happy for you.

144
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,233
Thanks for hooking me up
with those reservations.

145
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,403
They're under the name "googly bear."

146
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,489
Good...
You know, that wasn't very funny.

147
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,245
-What the...
-Wazowski.

148
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,290
What do you know?

149
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,251
It scares little kids
and little monsters.

150
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,838
I wasn't scared.
I have allergies.

151
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,217
-Sure.
-Randall, save it for the scare floor.

152
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:21,180
I'm in the zone today, Sullivan.
Gonna do serious scaring.

153
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,433
-Putting up some big numbers.
-Randall, that's great.

154
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,687
That should make it more humiliating
when we break the record first.

155
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,859
Do you hear that?
It's the winds of change.

156
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,614
"You hear that? It's the winds of..."

157
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,700
What a creep.
One of these days I am really

158
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,620
gonna let you
teach that guy a lesson.

159
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,629
Chalooby. Baby.

160
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,801
Good morning, Roz,
my succulent garden snail.

161
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,096
-Who would we be scaring today?
-Wazowski.

162
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,681
You didn't file your paperwork
last night.

163
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,600
Oh, that darn paperwork.

164
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,020
Wouldn't it be easier
if it all just blew away?

165
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,899
Don't let it happen again.

166
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,069
Yes. Well, I'll try to be less careless.

167
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,988
I'm watching you, Wazowski.

168
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,157
Always watching.

169
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,326
-She's nuts.
-Always.

170
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,621
All scare floors are now active.

171
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,916
Assistants, please report
to your stations.

172
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,757
OK, people,
Eastern Seaboard coming online.

173
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,885
We got scarers coming out.

174
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,985
They are so awesome.

175
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,117
Hey, may the best monster win.

176
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,036
I plan to.

177
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:35,707
We are on in seven, six, five,

178
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,211
four, three, two...

179
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,844
You're the boss.
You're the big hairy boss.

180
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,606
I'm feeling good today, Mikey.

181
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,027
Attaboy. Another door coming right up.

182
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,245
You're still behind, Randall.

183
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,415
-Maybe I should realign the scream...
-Get me a door.

184
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,833
Door, yes, door.

185
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,777
Well, Jerry, what's the damage so far?

186
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:49,031
We may actually
make our quota today, sir.

187
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,199
First time in a month.

188
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,626
-What happened?
-The kid almost touched me.

189
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,837
-She got this close to me.
-She wasn't scared of you?

190
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,381
-She was only six.
-I could have been dead.

191
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,177
-I could have died.
-Keep it together, man.

192
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,513
Hey, we got a dead door over here.

193
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,891
-I'm coming.
-Look out.

194
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,185
Excuse us.

195
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,607
We've lost 58 doors this week, sir.

196
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,734
Kids these days.

197
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,028
They just don't get scared
like they used to.

198
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,072
Let her rip.

199
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,627
-Sir?
-What?

200
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,253
Look.

201
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,591
Attention.
We have a new scare leader.

202
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,301
Randall Boggs.

203
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,721
Look at those numbers.

204
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,603
Slumber party.

205
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,274
Never mind.

206
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,819
Hey, watch it.

207
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,740
Well, James,
that was an impressive display.

208
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,118
Just doing my job, Mr. Waternoose.

209
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,620
'Course I did learn from the best.

210
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,207
If I don't see a new door
in my station in five seconds,

211
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,377
I will personally
put you through the shredder.

212
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,465
Hey, Wazowski, nice job.
Those numbers are pretty sweet.

213
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,093
Are they?
You know, I hadn't even noticed.

214
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,887
-And how's Georgie doing?
-He's doing great.

215
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,973
I love working with that big guy.

216
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,517
Keep the doors coming.
I'm on a roll today.

217
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,312
George and I are like brothers. 2319!

218
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,481
We have a 2319!

219
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,237
Red alert.

220
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,240
Red alert, red alert.

221
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,451
-Red alert.
-George Sanderson.

222
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:01,496
Please remain motionless.
Prepare for decontamination.

223
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,582
Duck and cover, people!

224
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,920
Not the CDA.

225
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,306
-Go, go, go.
-Coming through. Stand aside.

226
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,891
Clear the contaminated area.

227
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,729
-A 2319 in progress.
-Coming through. Watch yourself.

228
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,444
Stand back. Careful.

229
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,296
All clear. Situation is
niner-niner-zero. Ready for decon.

230
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,591
-Thanks, guys, that was a close one.
-OK.

231
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:09,981
Take a break. We gotta shut down
and reset the system.

232
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,609
An entire scare floor out of commission.

233
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,611
What else can go wrong?

234
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,242
-What a day.
-We're just going through a rough time.

235
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,536
Everyone knows
you'll get us through it.

236
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,163
Tell that to the board of directors.

237
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:30,752
James, this company's been
in my family for three generations.

238
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,005
I would do anything
to keep it from going under.

239
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,215
So would I, sir.

240
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:35,799
So would I, sir.

241
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,679
-I could use your help with something.
-Anything, sir.

242
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:45,225
We've hired some new scare recruits,
and frankly, they're...

243
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,436
-Inexperienced?
-They stink.

244
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,189
I thought maybe
you might come by tomorrow

245
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,358
and give them a demonstration.

246
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:56,361
Show them what it takes
to be our top scarer.

247
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,781
I'll start out with the old
Waternoose jump and growl.

248
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,036
Now that's my boy.

249
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,838
Let's go, everybody.
All doors must be returned.

250
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,715
No exceptions.

251
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,348
I've never seen anything like you today.
You were on a roll.

252
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,268
Another day like this
and that scare record's in the bag.

253
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,853
That's right, baby.

254
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:37,777
As if dinner wasn't enough,
I'm taking her to a monster truck rally.

255
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,362
-Nice.
-What's on your agenda?

256
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,865
-Work out some more.
-Again?

257
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,534
There's more to life than scaring.

258
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:50,415
-Can I borrow your odorant?
-I got smelly garbage or old dumpster.

259
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,418
You got low tide?
How about wet dog?

260
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,086
Yep. Stink it up.

261
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,884
I am so romantic sometimes
I think I should marry myself.

262
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,970
-Give me a break.
-What a night of romance ahead of me.

263
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:07,349
Tonight is about me and Celia.

264
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,727
The love boat is about to set sail.

265
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,774
I gotta tell you, that face of hers,
it just makes my heart go...

266
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,111
Hello, Wazowski.
Fun-filled evening planned for tonight?

267
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,446
Well, as a matter of fact...

268
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,908
I'm sure you filed
your paperwork correctly,

269
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,660
for once.

270
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,456
Your stunned silence
is very reassuring.

271
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,917
My scare reports.
I left them on my desk.

272
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:37,379
If I'm not at the restaurant in five
minutes they'll give our table away.

273
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,047
-Schmoopsie-pooh.
-Googly bear.

274
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,966
-Want to get going?
-Do I ever. It's just...

275
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,385
-What?
-It...

276
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,637
-A small...
-I don't understand.

277
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,139
I forgot about some paperwork
I was supposed to file.

278
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,933
Mike was reminding me.

279
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,893
-Thanks, buddy.
-I was?

280
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,478
I mean, I was. Yeah.

281
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,730
-OK. Let's go.
-We're going.

282
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:57,774
The pink copies to accounting.

283
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,569
The fuchsia ones go to purchasing
and the goldenrod ones go to Roz.

284
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,154
Leave the puce.

285
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,660
Pink copies to accounting,
fuchsia ones to Roz.

286
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,745
The fuchsia ones go to purchasing.

287
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,580
The goldenrod ones go to Roz.

288
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,583
Man, I have no idea what puce is.

289
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,130
Oh, that's puce.

290
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,095
Hello?

291
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,765
Anyone? There's a door here.

292
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,371
Hello? Hey.

293
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,124
Anybody scaring in here?

294
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,085
Hello. Yo.

295
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:51,990
Kitty.

296
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,826
No, no, stay back.

297
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,307
Hold it, hold it.

298
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:12,737
Michael, I've had a lot of birthdays...
Well, not a lot of birthdays.

299
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,114
But this is the best birthday ever.

300
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,242
What are you looking at?

301
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,412
I was just thinking about
the first time I laid eye on you,

302
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,957
-how pretty you looked.
-Stop it.

303
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:27,752
-Your hair was shorter.
-I'm thinking about getting it cut.

304
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,796
No, no, I like it this length.

305
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,339
I like everything about you.

306
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:35,468
Just the other day someone asked
who was the most beautiful monster.

307
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,471
-You know what I said?
-What did you say?

308
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,847
I said...

309
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,058
-Sulley?
-Sulley?

310
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,644
No, no, that's not what
I was gonna say.

311
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:45,812
You're not making sense.

312
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:49,816
-He's handsome. He's rugged.
-What a coincidence, running into you.

313
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,485
-I'm just gonna order something.
-Michael.

314
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,196
-What's good?
-You're ruining everything.

315
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,116
I went to get your paperwork
and there was a door.

316
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,367
What?

317
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,454
-A door?
-Randall was in it.

318
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,083
Randall? That cheater.
He's trying to boost his numbers.

319
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,793
-There's something else.
-What?

320
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,920
Ooklay in the agbay.

321
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,172
-What?
-Look in the bag.

322
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,383
What bag?

323
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:26,477
They don't have anything
I like here. Take care, Celia.

324
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,856
-What's going on?
-Celia, please try to understand.

325
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,026
-I have to do something!
-Michael?

326
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,863
On three. One, two...

327
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,533
-A kid!
-Boo!

328
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:46,914
A kid!

329
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,835
There's a kid here.
A human kid!

330
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,257
Googly bear!

331
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,182
Come on.

332
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,771
Let's get out of here.

333
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,524
Please remain calm.
This is not a drill.

334
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,112
7835 in progress, please advise.

335
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,365
-Michael? Michael!
-Celia!

336
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,867
-Come with me.
-Stop pushing.

337
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,911
Get your hands off
my schmoopsie-pooh.

338
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,455
Ready for decontamination.

339
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,209
I don't think that date
could have gone any worse.

340
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:41,094
If witnesses are to be believed,
there has been a child security breach

341
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,471
for the first time in monster history.

342
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:47,058
We neither confirm nor deny
the presence of a human child here.

343
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:51,354
Well, a kid flew right over me and
blasted a car with its laser vision.

344
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,649
I tried to run, but it picked me up
with its mind powers

345
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,025
and shook me like a doll.

346
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,319
It's true.
I saw the whole thing.

347
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:03,658
It is my professional opinion
that now is the time to panic.

348
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,331
It's coming. It's coming!

349
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,333
Boo!

350
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,675
No, no, no, no!

351
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,677
Come here, kid.

352
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,431
Don't touch those, you little...

353
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,892
Those were alphabetized.
It's OK.

354
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:33,396
As long as it doesn't come near us
we're gonna be OK.

355
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,283
You like this? Fetch.

356
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,538
Hey, hey. That's it.
No one touches Little Mikey.

357
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,209
Mike, give her the bear.

358
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,212
Oh, no!

359
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,645
Make it stop, Sulley.
Make it stop!

360
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,773
Here, look. See bear?
Nice bear.

361
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,400
Sulley!

362
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:23,362
Bear, he's a happy bear.

363
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,324
He's not crying, neither should you.
We'll be in trouble

364
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:30,328
'cause they're gonna find us,
so please stop crying now.

365
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,914
Good. Good, Sulley. Keep it up.
You're doing great.

366
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,957
He's a happy bear.
He has no...

367
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,711
-It touched me.
-Sulley, the bear!

368
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,172
The bear. Give her the...

369
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,476
What was that?

370
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,689
I have no idea, but it would be
really great if it didn't do it again.

371
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:22,171
How could I do this?
How could I be so stupid?

372
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:25,675
-This could destroy the company.
-Who cares about the company?

373
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,136
What about us?
That thing is a killing machine.

374
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,599
It's waiting for us to fall asleep
and then wham!

375
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:37,144
We're easy prey, my friend.
We're sitting targets.

376
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,064
OK, look, I think I have a plan here.

377
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,401
Using mainly spoons,
we dig a tunnel under the city

378
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,736
and release it into the wild.

379
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,321
Spoons.

380
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,742
That's it. I'm out of ideas.
Air balloon, too expensive.

381
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,955
Giant slingshot, too conspicuous.
Enormous wooden horse, too Greek.

382
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,585
No. Can't think. Can't think.

383
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,839
-Flatliner. Flatlining.
-Mike?

384
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,300
I think she's getting tired.

385
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,220
Well, then why don't you
find someplace for it to sleep

386
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,514
while I think of a plan!

387
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,352
Are you sleepy? Wanna sleep?

388
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,563
Is that what you want?

389
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:37,163
OK. I'll make a nice little area
for you to...

390
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:41,250
No. Hey, that's my bed.
You're gonna get your germs all over it.

391
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,339
Fine.
My chair's more comfortable anyway.

392
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,383
What?

393
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,221
It's just a closet.
Will you go to sleep?

394
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,435
Hey, that looks like Randall.

395
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,313
Randall's your monster.

396
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:05,399
You think he's gonna
come through the closet and scare you.

397
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,443
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

398
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,903
It's empty.

399
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,404
See?

400
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,448
No monster in here.

401
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,453
Well, now there is.

402
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,622
But I'm not gonna scare you.

403
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:21,791
I'm off duty.

404
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,796
OK.

405
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:31,425
How about I sit here
until you fall asleep?

406
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,304
Go ahead. Go to sleep.

407
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,933
Now. Now go.

408
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:44,313
You go to sleep.

409
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:22,226
Mike, this might sound crazy,
but I don't think that kid's dangerous.

410
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,895
Really? Well, in that case,
let's keep it.

411
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,939
I always wanted a pet
that could kill me!

412
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,400
What if we just
put her back in her door?

413
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,193
-What?
-Mike, think about it.

414
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:34,905
We send her back,
everything goes back to normal.

415
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:37,741
Is that a joke?
Tell me you're joking.

416
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,411
Sulley, I think that given
the circumstance

417
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,288
I've been extremely forgiving till now.

418
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:43,873
But that is a horrible idea.

419
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,667
Are we gonna march in public
with that thing?

420
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,628
Then I guess we waltz
right up to the factory, right?

421
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,383
I can't believe we are waltzing
right up to the factory.

422
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,720
Sulley, a mop, a couple of lights
and some chair fabric

423
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,473
are not gonna fool anyone.
Think about names.

424
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,850
Loch Ness. Bigfoot.
The Abominable Snowman.

425
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,644
They all got one thing in common.
Banishment!

426
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,397
-We could be next.
-Don't panic. We can do this.

427
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,524
-How you doing, Frank?
-Hey, guys.

428
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,027
Everything's going to be OK.

429
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,700
Number one wants this
dusted for prints.

430
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,411
-Careful with that.
-I got a good view.

431
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,288
A little lower.

432
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,624
This was recovered at the scene.

433
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,584
-Don't panic.
-Don't tell me not to.

434
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,336
-Keep it together.
-It's not OK.

435
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,671
-Boo.
-Could be contaminated.

436
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,341
Gentlemen, safety
is our number-one concern.

437
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,344
If there's anything that...
Not now. I'm...

438
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,221
Oh, hello, little one.

439
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,598
-Where did you come from?
-Mr. Waternoose!

440
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,767
James, is this one yours?

441
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,019
Actually, that's my cousin's sister's

442
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,230
-daughter, sir.
-Yeah, it's...

443
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,441
Bring an Obscure Relative
to Work Day.

444
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,819
Must have missed the memo.
Well, listen, James,

445
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,239
why don't you stop by the simulator
after lunch

446
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,033
and give us that scare demonstration?

447
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,868
Yeah. Oh, sir...

448
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,329
-Mr. Waternoose?
-Yes, yes. I'm coming.

449
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,790
I'll see you this afternoon, James.

450
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,001
That is, if these gentlemen
haven't shut us down.

451
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,836
-Oh, boy.
-A scare demo.

452
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,755
That is great.
Why am I the last to know?

453
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,384
We could bring your cousin's sister's
daughter. She'll be a big hit.

454
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,594
Halt.

455
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,514
Hold him down.

456
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,061
Come on. The coast is clear.

457
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,689
OK. All we have to do
is get rid of that thing.

458
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,649
So wait here while I get its card.

459
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,694
She can't stay here.
This is the men's room.

460
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,446
That is the weirdest thing
you've ever said.

461
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,158
Look. It loves it here.
It's dancing with joy.

462
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,579
I'll be right back with its door key.

463
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,001
That's a cute little dance.
It almost looks like you've got to...

464
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:08,684
Are you done in there?

465
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,563
Sorry, sorry.

466
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,703
OK. You're finished now, right?

467
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,413
Hello?

468
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,418
Boo.

469
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,472
Where did she go?

470
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,350
Did she disappear?

471
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,102
Did she turn invisible?

472
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,189
I just have no idea.

473
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,524
Gotcha.

474
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,735
Boo.

475
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,406
Hey, you're good.

476
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,956
Be relaxed. Be relaxed. Be relaxed.

477
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:17,127
Roz, my tender oozing blossom.
You're looking fabulous today.

478
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:20,464
Is that a new haircut?
Tell me, it's a new haircut.

479
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,176
New makeup. You had a lift.
You had a tuck. You had something.

480
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,430
Something has been inserted in
your skin that makes you look like...

481
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,852
I need a favor. Randall was working
late last night on the scare floor.

482
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,689
I need the key
for the door he was using.

483
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,650
Well, isn't that nice?

484
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:43,654
But guess what? You didn't turn in
your paperwork last night.

485
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,739
He didn't... No paperwork?

486
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,575
This office is now closed.

487
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,330
Ready or not, here I come.

488
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:54,748
I'm getting warmer.

489
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,500
Any second now.

490
00:38:56,584 --> 00:39:00,421
-Fee, fi, fo...
-What are you doing?

491
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,589
I'm looking for the kid.

492
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,300
-You lost it?
-No, no. She was just...

493
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,178
Here she is.

494
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,847
Hey. What's the matter?

495
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:13,100
-I already told your buddies...
-All right. Carry on.

496
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:29,408
Randall. Thank goodness.
What are we gonna do about the child?

497
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:53,599
It's on the front page.
The child. The one you were after.

498
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:57,060
Be quiet. Don't you think
I'm aware of the situation?

499
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,229
I was up all night trying to find it.

500
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:03,400
I did a calculation factoring in
the size of the sushi restaurant.

501
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,068
The child may have escaped!

502
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,988
Until we know for sure
we're gonna act like nothing happened.

503
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,365
Get the machine running.
I'll take care of the kid.

504
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,492
Get the machine running.
I'll take care of the kid.

505
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,745
When I find whoever let it out,
they're dead.

506
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,375
Why are you still here?
Come on, go! Move! Now!

507
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,668
I'm not here.

508
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:23,921
They're gone.

509
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,636
This is bad, so very bad.

510
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,054
What were they talking about,
machine?

511
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,555
Who cares?

512
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,975
All we have to do
is call her door and send her home.

513
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,770
Right. We're just two regular Joes
on our way to work.

514
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,688
We will blend right in.

515
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,358
-Top of the morning.
-What's shakin', bacon?

516
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,818
Did you lose weight?
Or a limb?

517
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,238
-You have her card key, right?
-Of course.

518
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,032
I told you I'd get her card key.
I went and got it.

519
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,076
Now I have her card key.

520
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,537
OK. Here we go.

521
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:01,208
Take care of yourself. Try not to
run through any more closets.

522
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,798
-Mike, that's not her door.
-Of course it's her door.

523
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,384
No. Her door was white
and it had flowers on it.

524
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:14,054
It must have been dark last night
because this is its door.

525
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,391
Hey, you hear that?
Sounds like fun in there.

526
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,561
Send me a postcard, kid.
That's Mike Wazowski, care of

527
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,397
22 Mike Wazowski,
you-got-your-life-back Lane.

528
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,525
Very good. Now bon voyage.

529
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:30,279
Bye-bye. Look at the stick.
See the stick? Go get the stick.

530
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,740
-Go fetch.
-Mike, this isn't Boo's door.

531
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:37,452
-Boo? What's Boo?
-That's what I decided to call her.

532
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:38,579
There a problem?

533
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,122
Sulley, you're not supposed to name it.

534
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,000
Once you name it,
you start getting attached to it.

535
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:46,753
Now put that thing back
where it came from, or so help me...

536
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:55,220
Hey. We're rehearsing a scene for
the upcoming company play called...

537
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,473
Put That Thing Back
Where It Came From or So Help Me.

538
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,350
It's a musical.

539
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:03,020
Put that thing back
where it came from or so help me

540
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,313
So help me, so help me

541
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:05,480
And cut.

542
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:09,735
We're still working on it.
It's in progress, but we need ushers.

543
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:13,780
Sulley, I've had enough.
Say goodbye to... Where did it go?

544
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,366
-Where is she?
-She got away from you again?

545
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:20,954
Well, that is just...
Wait a minute. The sun is coming up.

546
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,664
This is perfect.

547
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,124
She's gone!

548
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:27,085
Where are you going?
Sulley, don't blow this.

549
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,962
We're so close to breaking the record.

550
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,715
Somebody will find the kid.
It'll be their problem.

551
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,967
She's out of our hair!

552
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:37,888
-What are you two doing?
-They're rehearsing a play.

553
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,557
She's out of our hair

554
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:44,561
Can it! So, what do you think
of that kid getting out, Sullivan?

555
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,855
-Pretty crazy?
-Oh, yeah, crazy.

556
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,566
Word is the kid's been traced
to this factory.

557
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:52,235
-You haven't seen anything?
-Well...

558
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,237
No. No way.

559
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:58,533
But if it was an inside job,
I'd put my money on Waxford.

560
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,577
-Waxford?
-The one at station six.

561
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:03,497
-He's got them shifty eyes.
-Hey, Waxford.

562
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,458
-Sulley!
-Michael Wazowski!

563
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:13,674
Last night was one of the worst nights
of my entire life, bar none!

564
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,470
-I thought you cared about me.
-Honey, please.

565
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,723
-I thought you liked sushi.
-Sushi! Sushi!

566
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,559
You think this is about sushi?

567
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,274
Wazowski.

568
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,859
Michael!

569
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:33,944
Men.

570
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,280
Breathe. Keep breathing.

571
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,794
-Where's the kid?
-Kid?

572
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,047
-What kid?
-It's here in the factory, isn't it?

573
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,260
It never would have gotten out
if you hadn't been cheating last night.

574
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:58,885
Cheating? Cheating. Right.

575
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,389
Cheating? Cheating. Right.

576
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,892
OK. I think I know
how to make this all go away.

577
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:10,355
What happens when the whistle blows
in five minutes?

578
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:14,568
-I get a timeout?
-Everyone goes to lunch.

579
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,989
Which means the scare floor will be...

580
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,325
-Painted?
-Empty.

581
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,578
It'll be empty, you idiot.

582
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,204
You see that clock?

583
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:30,625
When the big hand is pointing up
and the little hand is pointing up,

584
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:33,170
the kid's door will be in my station.

585
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:36,256
But when the big hand points down,

586
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,383
the door will be gone.

587
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,553
You have until then to put the kid back.

588
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,889
Get the picture?

589
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,193
Boo!

590
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,237
-No.
-Hey, you. Halt.

591
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:00,781
He's the one.

592
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,366
-The one from the commercial.
-That's him.

593
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:06,912
-Can we get an autograph?
-Oh, sure. No problem.

594
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:09,372
Make that out to Stephanie,
my daughter.

595
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,624
Yes. Let's see.

596
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:14,211
"From your scary friend.
Best wishes..."

597
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:18,465
So, then I said, "If you talk to me
like that again, we're through".

598
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,384
-What'd she say?
-You know my mom.

599
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:24,304
-She sent me to my room.
-See you guys later. Take it easy.

600
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,722
Bottoms up.

601
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,282
Boo!

602
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,413
Hi.

603
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,835
Well, hello, there.
What's your name?

604
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,753
Mike Wazowski.

605
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:37,252
Sulley!

606
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:39,337
Oh, Sulley.

607
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,215
OK, Sulley, come on.

608
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,093
Hey! You guys seen Sulley anywhere?

609
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,429
-Nope, sorry.
-Sulley!

610
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,223
Boy, Wazowski
looks like he's in trouble.

611
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:54,477
2319! We have a 2319!

612
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,771
Oh, dear.

613
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:58,690
Sulley!

614
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,066
Sulley!

615
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,822
Sulley. Great news, pal.

616
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:08,366
I got us a way out of this mess,
but we gotta hurry.

617
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,910
Where is it?

618
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,997
Sull, that's a cube of garbage.

619
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,419
I can still hear her little voice.

620
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:21,838
-Mike Wazowski.
-I can hear it too.

621
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:24,674
-Mike Wazowski!
-How many kids you got in there?

622
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,343
Mike Wazowski!

623
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,554
-Kitty!
-Boo!

624
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:34,768
Boo, you're all right.
I was so worried. I was...

625
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,772
Don't you ever
run away from me again, young lady.

626
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:42,275
But I'm so glad you're safe.

627
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,487
My, what an affectionate father.

628
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:48,448
Actually, she's my cousin's sister's...

629
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,034
-That's enough. Let's go.
-Mike Wazowski.

630
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,620
Yeah. Step aside, kid.
We're in a...

631
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:04,089
-Will you stop making Boo laugh?
-I didn't. Come on.

632
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,178
I still don't understand.
You got Boo's door?

633
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,430
I'll explain later. Run.

634
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:16,267
Let's move, let's move. Come on.
Please be there. Please be there.

635
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:19,396
-There it is, just like Randall said.
-Randall?

636
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,898
Wait a minute. Boo, hey.

637
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:24,734
One, two, three, four,
get the kid through the door.

638
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,905
-The nightmare is over.
-It's OK, Boo. What's the matter?

639
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,449
-It's time to move.
-Mike, what are you thinking?

640
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:34,244
-Randall's after Boo.
-Who cares? Let's go.

641
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,330
-This is a limited-time offer.
-No. I don't like this.

642
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,000
Sulley, you wanted her door
and there it is.

643
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,585
-Now let's move.
-No, Mike.

644
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,422
You want me to prove
everything's on the up and up?

645
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,465
-He wants a door, I get a door.
-Wait.

646
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,634
Paranoid delusional furball.

647
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,096
Mike!

648
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:54,324
Hey, Sulley, where you been all day?

649
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,409
Sulley? Sulley!

650
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,719
Mike? Mike?

651
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:16,930
Where are you?

652
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,640
Are you in there?

653
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,767
Where are you, buddy?

654
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,560
Mike?

655
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:24,604
Where are you?

656
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:36,407
Boo, way to go.

657
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,750
It's OK.

658
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:06,479
Randall, did you have to...

659
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,783
-Yes! I got the kid.
-Oh, huzzah!

660
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:22,829
-Great news. Not that I was concerned.
-Get over here and help me.

661
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,999
Come on, while we're young here,
Fungus.

662
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,672
The kid needs to take off a few pounds.

663
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:40,096
Wazowski! Where is it,
you little one-eyed cretin?

664
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:43,183
It's cretin. If you're gonna
threaten me, do it properly.

665
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,435
Second, you're nuts if you think
kidnapping me

666
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,353
is gonna help you cheat!

667
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,151
You still think this is about
that stupid scare record?

668
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,819
Well, I did.

669
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:59,741
Right up until you chuckled like that.
Now I think I should get out of here.

670
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,578
I'm about to revolutionize
the scaring industry.

671
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,623
When I do,
even the great James P. Sullivan

672
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,458
is gonna be working for me.

673
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,628
Well, somebody's certainly
been a busy bee.

674
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:15,131
First I need to know where the kid is
and you're gonna tell me.

675
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,008
-I don't know.
-Sure.

676
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,177
I don't. I don't.

677
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:24,474
What's that? Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

678
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:27,227
Come on. No, no.
Come on. Hey, hey.

679
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,270
Hey, hey. This thing is moving.

680
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:34,234
I don't like big moving things
that are moving towards me.

681
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,944
No. Come on. Hey!

682
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:40,907
-Randall!
-Say hello to the scream extractor.

683
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:42,742
Hello.

684
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:46,079
Where you going?
We'll talk. We'll have a latte.

685
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:49,082
Come on. We can talk about this.

686
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:54,921
What is that thing?

687
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,632
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

688
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,509
No. Come on.

689
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:03,846
Help. Help! Help, help!

690
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:13,231
For... What did you do wrong this time?

691
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:16,609
-I don't know. I calibrated the...
-Go check the machine.

692
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,529
There must be something wrong
with the scream intake valve.

693
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:43,303
Fungus? Fungus? You like cars?

694
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:48,141
I got a really nice car. If you
let me go, I'll give you a ride

695
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,601
in the car.
Please, Fungus.

696
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:53,730
I'm sorry, Wazowski,
but Randall said I'm not allowed

697
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,733
to fraternize with victims
of his evil plot.

698
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,456
What happened?
Where's Wazowski?

699
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,336
Where is he?

700
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,802
-Come on.
-This is crazy. He's gonna kill us.

701
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:26,596
That could be contaminated.

702
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,598
We gotta get out of here now!

703
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:32,268
We could start a new life far away.
Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.

704
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:34,354
Goodbye, Mr. Waternoose.

705
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,939
-No, Mike, wait.
-Hey, what are you doing?

706
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:41,110
-Follow me. I have an idea.
-No, no, no, no, no.

707
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,947
-Simulation terminated.
-No, no, no, no, no.

708
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:48,993
What was that? You're trying
to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.

709
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:51,954
I was going for a snake/ninja approach

710
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,998
with a little hissing.

711
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,753
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's all about presence.

712
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:02,173
-About how you enter the room.
-Mr. Waternoose!

713
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,133
James, perfect timing.

714
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:06,135
No, no, sir. You don't understand.

715
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,846
-Show these monsters how it's done.
-I can't.

716
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,599
-Sir, you have to listen to me.
-Pay attention.

717
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,185
You're about to see
the best in the business.

718
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,979
-Reset the simulator.
-But sir!

719
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,940
-Good night, sweetheart.
-'Night, Mom.

720
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,983
-Kitty!
-No, Boo, no!

721
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:24,737
-Give us a big loud roar.
-There's no time for this!

722
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:27,573
-What are you waiting for? Roar.
-But, sir...

723
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,200
Roar!

724
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,964
Well done. Well done, James.

725
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,507
-Boo?
-All right, gentlemen.

726
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,927
-Right this way.
-I hope you've learned a lesson today.

727
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:53,599
Boo.

728
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,272
Boo.

729
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,195
Boo, it's me.

730
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,367
-The child!
-Sir, she isn't toxic.

731
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:14,078
-It sounds crazy, but trust me.
-Boo?

732
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,289
No, no, no, no, it's OK.

733
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,999
I was just... No.

734
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:22,128
No, don't be scared.
That wasn't real.

735
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,131
It's just a... I was just...

736
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:42,148
-Boo.
-...test it out on that sweet girl.

737
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,276
-Boo.
-...have her, he is trying to kill us.

738
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,445
-This is Randall's fault.
-Randall?

739
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:51,073
We can take you to his secret lab
in this factory.

740
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:54,994
How could this happen?
How could this happen?

741
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,164
Does anyone else know about this?

742
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,665
-No, sir.
-Good.

743
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:03,336
This company can't afford
any more bad publicity.

744
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,130
Now, before we do anything else,

745
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:09,342
let's take care of the child.

746
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,057
I never thought
things would come to this.

747
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,184
Not in my factory.

748
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:22,605
I'm sorry you boys got mixed up in this.

749
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,565
Especially you, James.

750
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:27,652
But now we can
set everything straight again.

751
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,278
For the good of the company.

752
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,618
Sir? That's not her door.

753
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,537
I know, I know.

754
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,124
It's yours.

755
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:47,630
No!

756
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,968
Boo!

757
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:01,852
No! No! No, no, no, no!

758
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,940
It's too late.
We're banished, genius!

759
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,984
We're in the human world.

760
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:11,279
What a great idea,
going to your old pal Waternoose.

761
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,656
Too bad he was in on the whole thing.

762
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,158
All you had to do was listen to me.

763
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:20,413
Just once!
But you didn't, did you?

764
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,832
You're still not listening!

765
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,090
Take that!

766
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:39,223
Welcome to the Himalayas.

767
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:45,438
Abominable. Can you believe that?

768
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,356
Do I look abominable to you?

769
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,734
Why can't they call me
the Adorable Snowman

770
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:52,862
or the Agreeable Snowman,
for crying out loud?

771
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:55,698
I'm a nice guy.
Snow cone?

772
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,327
No, don't worry. It's lemon.

773
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,788
How about you, big fella?
Snow cone?

774
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:08,252
Did you see the way she looked at me?

775
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,842
Poor guy. I understand.
It ain't easy being banished.

776
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,552
Take my buddy, Bigfoot.

777
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:20,890
When he was banished, he fashioned
an enormous diaper out of poison ivy.

778
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:22,975
Wore it on his head like a tiara.

779
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,937
Called himself King Itchy.
It won't be so hard for you guys.

780
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,439
How lucky can you get?

781
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:31,942
-Banished with your best friend.
-He is not my friend.

782
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:35,946
I just assumed you were buddies.
When I saw you in the snow hugging...

783
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:39,075
Look at that big jerk.
Ruined my life. And for what?

784
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,409
A stupid kid!

785
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:43,746
Because of you I am now stuck
in this frozen wasteland.

786
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:47,124
Wasteland?
I think you mean wonderland.

787
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,669
How about all this fabulous snow?

788
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,380
And wait till you see
the local village.

789
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:56,425
Cutest thing in the world.
I haven't mentioned the free yaks' milk.

790
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,095
-What did you say?
-Yaks' milk.

791
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,263
Milking a yak ain't exactly a picnic.

792
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,766
Once you pick the hairs out
it's nutritious.

793
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,268
No, about a village.
Are there kids in it?

794
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:09,605
Kids? Sure. Tough kids, sissy kids,
kids who climb on rocks.

795
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:12,149
-Where is it?
-At the bottom of the mountain.

796
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:15,027
-A three-day hike.
-Three days?

797
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:17,113
We need to get there now.

798
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,333
You wanna go to the village?

799
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:33,546
Rule number one out here,
always... No.

800
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,132
Never go out in a blizzard.

801
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:38,551
We need to get to Boo.

802
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:42,680
Boo? What about us?

803
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:46,726
Ever since the kid came in,
you've ignored everything I've said,

804
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:51,981
and now look where we are!
We were about to break the record.

805
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:55,526
-We would have had it made.
-None of that matters now.

806
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,571
None of it matters?
Wait a second.

807
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,823
None of it matters?

808
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,745
OK. No, good. Great.

809
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,956
So now the truth comes out, doesn't it?

810
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:13,878
Would you look at that?
We're out of snow cones.

811
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:16,756
Let me just go outside
and make some more.

812
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:21,260
Sulley, what about everything
we ever worked for?

813
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:23,888
Does that matter?

814
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,766
What about Celia?

815
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:30,102
I am never...
Never gonna see her again.

816
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,855
Doesn't that matter?

817
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:39,403
And what about me?

818
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,782
I'm your pal. I'm your best friend.

819
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,493
Don't I matter?

820
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,289
I'm sorry, Mike.

821
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:52,458
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.

822
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,002
I didn't mean for this to happen.

823
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,254
But Boo's in trouble.

824
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:00,508
I think there might be
a way to save her if we can just get...

825
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:03,093
We? Whoa. We?

826
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:06,722
No. There's no "we" this time, pal.

827
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:10,518
If you want to go out there
and freeze to death,

828
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,645
you be my guest.

829
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:15,773
Because you're on your own.

830
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:55,020
Hey, I got more snow cones!

831
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:45,321
Come on, George.
I know you can do this.

832
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,573
I picked out an easy door for you.

833
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:50,826
In Nepal. Nice, quiet Nepal.

834
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:53,996
You know, you're right.
Here. Take this.

835
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,873
Go get 'em, Georgie.

836
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:57,458
Look out. Coming through.

837
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:00,294
-Sorry, George.
-Hey, you can't just...

838
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:02,671
Twenty-three...

839
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,762
Out of the way!

840
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:18,187
Finally. I never should have
trusted you with this.

841
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:21,273
Because of you,
I had to banish my top scarer.

842
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,525
With this machine,
we won't need scarers.

843
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,778
Sullivan got what he deserved.

844
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,948
Sullivan was twice the scarer
you will ever be.

845
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,171
Kitty!

846
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:52,846
-Kitty!
-Sullivan?

847
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:01,313
-Kitty!
-Sorry, Boo.

848
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:03,148
Stop him!

849
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:05,484
Let's get you home.

850
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:10,489
Finish him off!

851
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,917
You don't know how long
I've wanted to do that, Sullivan.

852
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,514
Mike?

853
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,100
-It's not that I don't care.
-Mike, you don't understand.

854
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,310
Yes, I do.
I was just mad, that's all.

855
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:44,732
I needed some time to think, but
you shouldn't have left me out there.

856
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,776
-I'm being attacked.
-I'm not attacking you.

857
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:51,363
I'm trying to be honest. Hear me out.
You and I are a team.

858
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,991
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

859
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,201
I know. He's too sensitive.

860
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,498
Come on, pal.
If you start crying, I'm gonna cry.

861
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:03,751
And I'll never get through this.

862
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:06,879
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you,
but I am now.

863
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:11,383
Sulley, I am baring my soul here.
The least you can do is pay attention.

864
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:17,639
Look at that. It's Randall.

865
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,434
Come on.

866
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:23,687
Get up. There can't be any witnesses.

867
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:24,813
There won't be.

868
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,107
I'm glad you came back, Mike.

869
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:30,444
Somebody's gotta take care of you,
you big hairball.

870
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:36,158
-Schmoopsie-pooh, I can't talk.
-Come on.

871
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:40,746
Michael, if you don't tell me what's
going on right now, we are through!

872
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:42,289
Here's the truth.

873
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:46,627
The kid? Sulley let her in. We tried to
send her back, Waternoose had a plot,

874
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,088
and now Randall's trying to kill us!

875
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:52,549
You expect me to believe
that pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?

876
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:54,218
Mike Wazowski.

877
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,179
I love you, schmoopsie-pooh!

878
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:00,349
-Hey!
-Idiots.

879
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,018
Look out. Coming through.

880
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:05,854
Make way. Move it.
Hurry up, hurry up.

881
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,900
-There they are.
-Attention, employees.

882
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:13,946
Randall Boggs has just broken
the all-time scare record.

883
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:17,116
No, I didn't.
Get out of my way.

884
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,618
Go get 'em, googly bear.

885
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:22,204
There it is.

886
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,998
Get off my tail. Let go.

887
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:30,295
-What are you doing?
-Grab on, Mike.

888
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,340
Are you out of your mind?

889
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,395
-Sulley, what are we doing?
-Get Boo's door and find a station.

890
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,981
What a plan.
Simple, yet insane.

891
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:04,371
-Whoa.
-Oh, boy.

892
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,498
Hold on!

893
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,842
Don't look down!

894
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,443
I'm gonna be sick.

895
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:39,948
Oh, no.

896
01:08:43,912 --> 01:08:45,162
No!

897
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,624
-Boo's door.
-There it is.

898
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,418
How are we supposed to get to it now?

899
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:56,340
It's a dead end, Sulley.

900
01:08:58,051 --> 01:08:59,551
-There he is.
-Make her laugh.

901
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,386
-Sulley!
-Just do it!

902
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,148
-Get it open.
-Here he comes.

903
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:14,900
Give me that kid.

904
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:23,909
-Why couldn't we get banished here?
-We gotta find another door.

905
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:31,041
Look! Boo's door.

906
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,507
-There he is. Hurry up!
-Give me your hand.

907
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:48,058
-Come on, it slides.
-Right. Right.

908
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:53,772
Jump. I'm right behind you.

909
01:09:58,444 --> 01:09:59,903
Come on.

910
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,323
Hurry up. Keep moving!

911
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:05,117
Get inside.

912
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:07,661
That was weird.

913
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,413
Mike?

914
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:11,748
-Sorry, buddy.
-OK.

915
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,717
I hope that hurt, lizard boy.

916
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:28,473
Great job, buddy. We lost him.

917
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,850
Boo!

918
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:32,561
No!

919
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,732
Nice working with you.

920
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:38,233
-Get it open!
-I'm trying!

921
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:40,986
-Open the door!
-Come on, get in here.

922
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:51,830
Boo!

923
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,793
There they are!

924
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:03,175
Sulley, what are you doing?
Sulley!

925
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:10,265
-Looks like we caught the express.
-Do you see them?

926
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,059
Straight ahead.

927
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,292
-Kitty.
-Boo.

928
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:47,469
Look at everybody's
favorite scarer now.

929
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,680
You stupid, pathetic waste.

930
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:57,896
You've been number one for too long,
Sullivan. Now your time is up.

931
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:03,318
And don't worry.
I'll take good care of the kid.

932
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:04,611
No!

933
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,635
She's not scared of you anymore.

934
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,222
Looks like you're out of a job.

935
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:36,184
OK, over the plate.
Let's see the old stuff.

936
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:38,186
Chuck him, baby.

937
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:42,232
Here's the pitch and he is out of here.

938
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:46,361
-Mama, another gator got in the house.
-Another gator?

939
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:48,572
Give me that shovel. There!

940
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:51,283
Get him, Mama. Get that gator.

941
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:56,329
-Care to do the honors, Mikey?
-With pleasure.

942
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,966
That's right, Boo. You did it.

943
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,676
You beat him.

944
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,303
Come on.

945
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:15,765
OK, Boo, it's time to go home.

946
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:18,810
Take care of yourself
and be a good girl, OK?

947
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,814
-Oh, no.
-The power's out. Make her laugh.

948
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:25,984
I got a move here
that'll bring down the house.

949
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:32,073
-Sorry. She didn't see that.
-What?

950
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:35,285
What, did you forget to check
if her hood was up, you big dope?

951
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:38,371
Uncle Mike, try not to yell
in front of her.

952
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:41,166
-You know we need her to laugh.
-Right.

953
01:13:41,501 --> 01:13:43,752
Hey, Boo. Just kidding. Look.

954
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:46,296
Funny, right? See, with the...

955
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,841
These are the jokes, kid.
What's happening?

956
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:51,843
Hold on.

957
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,430
When the door lands in the station,
cut the power.

958
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:59,893
You'll have the child and the criminals
responsible for this whole mess.

959
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:04,356
Great. A welcoming committee.
What are we gonna do?

960
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:21,414
This is the CDA. Come out slowly
with the child in plain sight.

961
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:24,125
OK, OK, you got us.

962
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,044
Here we are. Here's the kid.

963
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:30,382
I'll cooperate, but before you
take us away, I have one thing to say.

964
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,677
-Catch.
-2319.

965
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,304
We have a toxic projectile.

966
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:40,225
-After the suspect.
-Stop him!

967
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,939
-Come on.
-Don't let them get away.

968
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,860
Wait. Come back.
He has the child.

969
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,618
Sullivan. Sullivan!

970
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:02,414
Give me the child. Give her to me!

971
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:14,175
Open this door.
Open this door!

972
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:21,349
Stop it.

973
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:23,059
Don't do it.

974
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,771
-Come on.
-Don't go in that room.

975
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,695
I think we stopped him, Boo.
You're safe now.

976
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,697
You be a good girl, OK?

977
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:40,619
-This has gone far enough, James.
-She's home. Leave her alone.

978
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:43,288
I can't do that. She's seen too much.

979
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,082
-You both have.
-It doesn't have to be this way.

980
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:48,918
I have no choice. Times have changed.

981
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:52,047
-Scaring isn't enough anymore.
-But kidnapping?

982
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:55,467
I'll kidnap 1,000 children
before I let the company die.

983
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,845
And I'll silence anyone
who gets in my way!

984
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:01,681
No!

985
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:03,224
-Night, Mom.
-Night, sweetheart.

986
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:04,851
-Night, Mom.
-What is this?

987
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:08,563
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.

988
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:11,733
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you guys,

989
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:14,235
but I spotted several big mistakes.

990
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,237
But how did...

991
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:19,741
You know what? Let's watch
my favorite part again. Shall we?

992
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:23,078
I'll kidnap 1,000 children
before I let this company die.

993
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,082
I'll kidnap 1,000 children
before I let this company die.

994
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:31,044
I'll kidnap 1,000 children
before I let this company die.

995
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:32,879
-Come with us.
-What are you doing?

996
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:35,256
Take your hands off.
You can't arrest me.

997
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:38,843
I hope you're happy, Sullivan.
You destroyed this company.

998
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:43,223
Monsters, Incorporated is dead!
Where will everyone get their scream?

999
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:47,560
The energy crisis will only get worse
because of you!

1000
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,984
Stay where you are.
Number one wants to talk to you.

1001
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:56,653
Attention.

1002
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:05,203
Hello, boys.

1003
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:06,705
-Roz?
-Roz?

1004
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:12,627
Two and a half years of
undercover work were almost wasted

1005
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:15,672
when you intercepted that child,
Mr. Sullivan.

1006
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:18,341
Of course, without your help,

1007
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:22,679
I never would have known that
this went all the way up to Waternoose.

1008
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,060
Now, about the girl.

1009
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:32,021
I just want to send her home.

1010
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,232
Very good.

1011
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:37,861
-Bring me a door shredder.
-What? You mean...

1012
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:40,238
You mean I can't see her again?

1013
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,866
That's the way it has to be.

1014
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,161
I'll give you five minutes.

1015
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:00,425
-Well, so long, kid.
-Mike Wazowski.

1016
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:02,260
Yeah.

1017
01:18:02,762 --> 01:18:03,928
Boo.

1018
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,388
It's been fun.

1019
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:10,310
Go ahead. Go grow up.

1020
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:31,956
But, Boo...

1021
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,083
Boo.

1022
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:37,003
Look at that. You know...

1023
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:39,798
That's cute. Yeah.

1024
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:42,383
Boo...

1025
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:45,804
Well, that's very nice.

1026
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:48,765
Come here, you!

1027
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:59,067
Oh, he's a happy bear

1028
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:08,451
Nothing's coming out of your closet
to scare you anymore, right?

1029
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:10,495
Yeah.

1030
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,040
Goodbye, Boo.

1031
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,334
Kitty.

1032
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,337
Kitty has to go.

1033
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:01,212
Boo.

1034
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:05,425
Kitty?

1035
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:17,729
None of this ever happened,
gentlemen.

1036
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:22,734
And I don't want to see
any paperwork on this.

1037
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,299
Take him away.

1038
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:51,512
I bet we get the rest of the day off.

1039
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:54,766
You idiot.
They're gonna shut down the factory.

1040
01:20:57,728 --> 01:21:00,355
When that wall went up, you should
have seen Waternoose's face.

1041
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,941
I hope we get a copy of that tape.

1042
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:04,400
Are you all right?

1043
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,653
Come on, pal.
Cheer up. We did it!

1044
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:08,196
We got Boo home.

1045
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,907
Sure, we put the factory
in the toilet and

1046
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:13,159
hundreds of people
will be out of work.

1047
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:16,120
Not to mention the mob that will
come after us when there's no power,

1048
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:18,957
but at least we had some laughs, right?

1049
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,170
Laughs.

1050
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:47,318
Is this thing on?
Hello? Hello? Testing.

1051
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:50,071
Good evening. Nice to see you.

1052
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,657
It's great to be here in your room.

1053
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,492
Where are you from?

1054
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:58,579
You're in kindergarten, right?
I love kindergarten.

1055
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,623
Best three years of my life.

1056
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,419
Of my life.
But I love sports.

1057
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:07,880
Dodgeball was the best.
I was the fastest one out there.

1058
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:09,924
Of course, I was the ball.

1059
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:12,635
I was the ball, see...

1060
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,679
All right.

1061
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:31,529
Thanks a lot.
I'll be here all week.

1062
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,948
Remember to tip your waitresses.

1063
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:40,955
Great job, Mikey. You filled your quota
on the first kid of the day.

1064
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,125
Not bad. Only somebody
with perfect comedic timing

1065
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,961
could produce this much energy
in one shot.

1066
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,964
And the fact that laughter
is ten times more powerful than scream

1067
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:51,632
had nothing to do with it?

1068
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:55,386
Googly bear, come here, you.

1069
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,014
-Schmoopsie-pooh!
-Googly.

1070
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:04,062
Girls, stop, stop, stop.

1071
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:06,898
Michael, you're such a charmer.

1072
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:06,939
Michael, you're such a charmer.

1073
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:09,525
-Did you bring the magazine?
-A whole box.

1074
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,319
Let me see it!

1075
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,488
Sulley and I made the cover, right?

1076
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,783
I don't believe it!

1077
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:18,868
Googly bear.

1078
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:22,538
I'm on the cover of a magazine!

1079
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:30,546
This is great.

1080
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,201
-Hey, Sulley.
-Hey, Mike.

1081
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:02,912
-I was...
-There's something I want to show you.

1082
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:04,956
Close your eyes. Follow me.

1083
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,625
Come on. No peeking.

1084
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:10,753
Keep coming, keep coming.

1085
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:11,879
-Come on.
-Mike!

1086
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:14,549
Follow the sultry sound of my voice.

1087
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:15,758
OK, stop.

1088
01:24:15,843 --> 01:24:17,134
Open 'em.

1089
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:23,349
Mike, is that...

1090
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:25,393
Sorry it took so long, pal.

1091
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:28,104
There was a lot of wood to go through.

1092
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:31,107
