1
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,680
Henry, it's time.

2
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,453
Which one did
you say moved?

3
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,593
The one on the left.

4
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,263
Aw.
Aw.

5
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,531
You're a poppa.

6
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,838
You're a momma.

7
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,210
Hmm?

8
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,216
You little sneak.

9
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,452
Hello, Libby.

10
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,487
Libby.

11
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,601
Hmm?

12
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,943
Hello, Buck.

13
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,614
He's got your eyes.

14
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,991
Get out of there,
you little prickle bush.

15
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,666
All right, this is
gonna be a big one.

16
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,668
Hmm?

17
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,478
Hello, Arlo.

18
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,692
Come on out.

19
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,038
Look at you.

20
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,078
Buck!

21
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,562
Whoa!

22
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,802
That's Clawtooth Mountain.
And this is our farm.

23
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,840
And we're all gonna
take care of it together.

24
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,618
What?
Gotcha!

25
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,125
Libby!

26
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,098
Ha-ha!

27
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,902
Ooh!

28
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,367
Ha-ha. Gotcha back!

29
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,336
Momma, I'm
done watering.

30
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,306
Good job, Libby.
Buck, get back to your chores.

31
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,374
What?
Thanks, Buck.

32
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,776
But I... I...

33
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,554
You're all set.

34
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,384
Can't I do
something else, Momma?

35
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,887
Get going.

36
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,628
Okay.

37
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,195
Who is that?

38
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,665
Oh!

39
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,905
Hey, Eustice.

40
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,571
Aw, you stuck,
little guy?

41
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:56,441
Let me get that for you.
You're free.

42
00:07:56,442 --> 00:08:00,651
Hello, move. Go find
your poppa and your...

43
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,386
Momma!

44
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,629
Whoa. The river's
not something

45
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,765
to mess around with there, Arlo.

46
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,467
Be careful.
What's the problem?

47
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,871
Poppa, Henrietta is the
worst one in the coop!

48
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,473
Yesterday you said
Footless Fran was the worst.

49
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:31,643
She's only got one foot.

50
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,012
You don't
have to like 'em, Arlo.

51
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,020
You just have to feed 'em.

52
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,691
That should do it.

53
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,960
Now, this will keep them rotten
critters from stealing our food

54
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:52,564
because I made this silo
100% critter-proof.

55
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,500
Put your mark on there, Henry.
You earned it.

56
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,636
Yeah, Poppa, do it!
Come on!
Yeah!

57
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,938
Only if your
momma does it first.

58
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,913
If anyone's earned
a mark around here, it's her.

59
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,520
Did you just put your mark
higher than mine?

60
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:19,024
What? No.
It's just the angle you're looking at it.

61
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,893
The "angle," huh?

62
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,061
Ooh, ooh. Me too!
Me, me, me! My turn!

63
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,063
My turn!

64
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,799
Now hold on.
It's not that easy.

65
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,003
You've got to earn your mark
by doing something big.

66
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:35,474
For something
bigger than yourself.

67
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:38,543
Someday you'll
all make your mark

68
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,785
and I can't wait
to see it.

69
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,697
That is how you clear a field.
Attaboy, Buck.

70
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,812
He'll figure it out.
Be just fine.

71
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,881
Go on, Buck.
You earned it.

72
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,152
Good job, son.

73
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,950
You've
got it, Libby!

74
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,191
Just a little bit more.

75
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,229
Beautiful.
You earned your mark, sweetheart.

76
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,869
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

77
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,037
Arlo!

78
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,012
He'll get there.

79
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,864
All right, you cluckers,
you're about to get fed.

80
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,027
Arlo.
Huh?

81
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,763
Come here.
Buck! What happened?

82
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,833
I came to help you
with your chores.

83
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,769
And then they attacked.

84
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,837
You're gonna be okay.

85
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,739
Tell Momma I love her.

86
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,381
I see a light.

87
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:20,879
I'll go get help!

88
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,053
Oh, you should
see your face!

89
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,789
I should've known!

90
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,130
Always got to mess me up.
Me?

91
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,963
You mess up your chores
and everyone else's.

92
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,038
- You're such a coward.
- Buck!

93
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:48,640
I ain't a coward.
And I'm gonna make my mark.

94
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,110
Just like you,
and Libby, and everyone!

95
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,019
You will, darling. You just
need a little more time.

96
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:59,390
Forget it. I didn't even want
that dumb mark anyway.

97
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,864
I got an idea.

98
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:20,105
Arlo. Arlo. Wake up.

99
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,378
Huh?

100
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,981
Come with me.

101
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,016
Uh...

102
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,363
Where are we going?
You'll see.

103
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,171
Okay, now take
a walk out there.

104
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,943
By myself?
Go on.

105
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,392
Poppa. Poppa.

106
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,929
Calm down. Breathe.

107
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,401
Oh.

108
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,769
Sometimes you got to
get through your fear

109
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,144
to see the beauty
on the other side.

110
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,224
Wow.

111
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:27,132
I got a new job
for you tomorrow.

112
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:31,075
That is if you still
want to make your mark.

113
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:37,242
The dang wilderness critter's
coming over the fence, eating our food,

114
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,078
and I've had it
up to my snout.

115
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,813
If this keeps up,
we won't have

116
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,354
enough food to
survive the winter.

117
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,092
That's why you are
gonna catch that critter.

118
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,270
Then along comes a critter...

119
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,577
And this is how
you're gonna finish the job.

120
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,110
When that critter's
taken care of,

121
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:17,015
you'll put your mark on
the silo right next to mine.

122
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,591
I'll take care of the critter, Poppa.
It won't stand a chance.

123
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,572
What are you doing,
you bug?

124
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,608
Get out of here.

125
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:43,180
Huh! Move along, leaf.
Move along.

126
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,600
You're dead, critter.

127
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,232
Okay. You're free.

128
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:13,270
What are you doing?
Just leave! Flee!

129
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:17,241
Stay back! Go! Whoa.

130
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,479
Arlo!

131
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,210
Why'd you let it go?

132
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,513
It was biting, and coming at me,
and screeching, and...

133
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,416
You had a job to do.

134
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:35,453
You got to get over your fear, Arlo,
or you won't survive out here.

135
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,396
Come on.

136
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,366
We're gonna finish
your job right now.

137
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,166
Out there?

138
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,234
Get over.

139
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,144
But, Poppa, what if
we get lost?

140
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,579
As long as you can
find the river,

141
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,587
you can find your way home.

142
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,223
What do you see?

143
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,487
Uh, tracks?

144
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,695
And they're washing out,
we got to move!

145
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,371
We're losing it!

146
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,447
Arlo, keep moving!

147
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,188
Poppa, wait.

148
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,729
Arlo, what did I
say about keeping...

149
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,439
It's okay.

150
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:03,107
It's okay, Arlo.
I'm sorry.

151
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,350
I just wanted you to
get through your fear.

152
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,419
I know
you have it in you.

153
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,389
But I'm not like you.

154
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,459
You're me and more.

155
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,126
I think we went
far enough today.

156
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,801
Storm's getting worse.
Let's get you home.

157
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,380
Arlo, move!

158
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,354
Run, Arlo!

159
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,630
Poppa!

160
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,436
Poppa! Poppa! Poppa!

161
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,839
Momma!

162
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,604
If we don't get
this harvest in

163
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,445
before the first snow,

164
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,748
we won't have
enough food for winter.

165
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,516
I know it's hard
without Poppa,

166
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:54,491
but I need you
to do more, Arlo.

167
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,968
Don't worry, Momma.
I won't let us starve.

168
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,971
You're a good son.

169
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,822
Huh?

170
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,768
You!
Huh?

171
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,505
You've got some
nerve coming here.

172
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,540
It's all your fault!

173
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,516
My poppa would still be alive
if it weren't for you!

174
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,600
Help!

175
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:15,071
Momma! Momma!

176
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,642
Momma!

177
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,640
Momma?

178
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,078
Momma!

179
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,011
You!

180
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:13,016
I should've
killed you the first time.

181
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,985
This is all your fault.

182
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,660
Get over here.
Get over here.

183
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,065
Get away. Get away.
Get away. Get away!

184
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:49,019
That's right.
You better run!

185
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,914
Where am I?
Where's home?

186
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,750
Oh.

187
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,088
As long as you can
find the river,

188
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,196
you can find your way home.

189
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,322
You again?

190
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,460
Get out of here.

191
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,114
Ugh!

192
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:27,150
I told you to
stay away from me.

193
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:43,961
I am still gonna
squeeze the life out of you.

194
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,703
But before I do,
can you find me some more?

195
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:54,271
Uh, here, more of these.

196
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,372
You know...

197
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,215
No. Stop.
What are you doing?

198
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,186
Hey, wait.
Can you take me to the berries?

199
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,743
Where are you going?

200
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:48,992
I knew it.

201
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:51,234
I'm gonna die out here.
Because of you.

202
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:58,202
Hey. Hey. What are you doing?
No, no, no. Stop!

203
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,041
Hey. Hey. No. Stop!

204
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,484
Ooh.

205
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,084
Ow. Ow.

206
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,553
Why you little...
Come back here!

207
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,333
Berries!

208
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,668
Oh!

209
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,475
What's with you?

210
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,517
They're right here.
Crazy critter.

211
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,662
Hello.

212
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,568
Hello?

213
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,601
We've been watching you.

214
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:49,318
We thought you were going to die,
but then you didn't.

215
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,904
That creature
protected you.

216
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,368
Why?

217
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,403
I don't know.

218
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,406
I'm going home. Do you know
how far Clawtooth Mountain is?

219
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,916
Good idea. We want him.

220
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,113
Why?

221
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,148
Because it's
terrifying out here.

222
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:28,457
He can protect me
like my friends.

223
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:30,687
This is Fury.

224
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:34,391
He protects me from the creatures
that crawl in the night.

225
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:37,127
This is Destructor.

226
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,629
She protects me
from mosquitoes.

227
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,299
This is Dream Crusher.

228
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,541
He protects me from
having unrealistic goals.

229
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,678
And this is Debbie.

230
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,384
Yes, we need him.

231
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,820
What is his name?

232
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,251
A name? I don't know.

233
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:04,427
Hmm. Then I will
meditate on this.

234
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,829
Hmm...

235
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:11,667
I name him,
I keep him. Hmm...

236
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,536
Killer.

237
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,507
Hmm... Beast.

238
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,472
Hmm... Murderer.

239
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:23,979
Hmm...
Uh... Grubby!

240
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,477
Funeral Planner?
Uh, Cootie!

241
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,646
Hmm... Hemorrhoid.
Uh, Squirt!

242
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,548
Uh, Frank!
Stinky!

243
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,183
Maniac!
Funky!

244
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,351
Violet.
Spike!

245
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,620
Lunatic.
Spot!

246
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:40,624
Spot! Come here,
Spot. Come here.

247
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,760
He is named.
You clearly are connected.

248
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,695
Good for you.

249
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,764
On your path to
Clawtooth Mountain

250
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,367
that creature
will keep you safe.

251
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,368
Don't ever lose him.

252
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,705
No. No. You can't
have him, Debbie.

253
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,514
No, no, no. Debbie!

254
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:05,715
Debbie! Stop!
You're better than this.

255
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:09,892
No, no, no!
Come back! Debbie!

256
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,604
Where are you going?
I need to get home.

257
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,638
Ow!

258
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:41,478
Huh?

259
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,635
Ugh...

260
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,689
Spot, watch this.

261
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:36,632
Oh.

262
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:54,850
Huh? Huh?

263
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,049
I miss...

264
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,985
I miss my family.

265
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,824
Family.

266
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,166
That's me.

267
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,140
There's Libby.

268
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,275
And Buck.

269
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,778
And Momma.

270
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,081
And...

271
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,220
And Poppa.

272
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,160
Family.

273
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,099
Huh?

274
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:21,837
You don't understand.
That's okay.

275
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,092
Yes. That's your family.

276
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:44,419
I miss him.

277
00:45:33,085 --> 00:45:34,391
Oh...

278
00:46:15,461 --> 00:46:16,900
We should stop.

279
00:46:23,469 --> 00:46:25,375
Stop!

280
00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:36,720
Arlo, move.

281
00:46:45,424 --> 00:46:46,563
Run, Arlo!

282
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:45,922
Where's the river?

283
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:49,559
I've lost the river.

284
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:52,996
I'm never getting home.

285
00:47:55,694 --> 00:47:57,501
I'm never getting home.

286
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:06,009
Help! Help! Help!

287
00:48:11,543 --> 00:48:13,544
Aw, say, friend,
are you wounded?

288
00:48:13,545 --> 00:48:15,546
No. I'm not hurt.

289
00:48:15,547 --> 00:48:17,648
Oh, good. Thank
goodness for that.

290
00:48:17,649 --> 00:48:19,717
Uh, Coldfront, Downpour,

291
00:48:19,718 --> 00:48:21,552
keep looking
for wounded folk.

292
00:48:21,553 --> 00:48:24,288
Wait. I'm lost.
I need to get home.
Clawtooth Mountain.

293
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:26,424
Uh...
Clawtooth Mount...

294
00:48:26,425 --> 00:48:28,826
Oh, you mean the mountain
range with the three points.

295
00:48:28,827 --> 00:48:30,728
Yes! Yeah!

296
00:48:30,729 --> 00:48:33,531
Oh, yeah. I've been there.
Uh, but you know, kid... Mmm.

297
00:48:33,532 --> 00:48:37,235
You're not even close.
Still, I know the way.

298
00:48:37,236 --> 00:48:38,569
My name's Arlo.

299
00:48:40,439 --> 00:48:42,306
I'm sorry. I just...

300
00:48:42,307 --> 00:48:43,808
I used to have
a name like that once.

301
00:48:43,809 --> 00:48:47,751
That was before
I started following the storm!

302
00:48:47,846 --> 00:48:49,514
The storm?

303
00:48:49,515 --> 00:48:53,317
The storm swept me out.
I was afraid for my life,

304
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:56,320
but the storm
gave me a relevation.

305
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:58,422
And I wasn't
scared anymore.

306
00:48:58,423 --> 00:49:00,258
You mean a revelation?

307
00:49:00,259 --> 00:49:04,362
No! A relevation. Okay?

308
00:49:04,363 --> 00:49:07,265
I was at a real
low point. You know?

309
00:49:07,266 --> 00:49:09,667
And the storm swept me up
to a real high point,

310
00:49:09,668 --> 00:49:12,603
and then left me at
a higher relevation.

311
00:49:12,604 --> 00:49:13,771
Wow.

312
00:49:13,772 --> 00:49:15,373
Yeah, wow.

313
00:49:15,374 --> 00:49:16,807
That's when the storm
gave me my new name

314
00:49:16,808 --> 00:49:18,576
because...
What do we say?

315
00:49:18,577 --> 00:49:20,511
The storm provides.

316
00:49:20,512 --> 00:49:24,282
The storm provides.
You can call me Thunderclap.

317
00:49:24,283 --> 00:49:27,385
Thunderclap.
Can you help me get home?

318
00:49:27,386 --> 00:49:29,320
Uh, yeah, well...
Uh, maybe. Oh!

319
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:31,722
But first, we just
need to check the area.

320
00:49:31,723 --> 00:49:33,658
There's plenty of
folks in a bad way

321
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:35,493
after a storm like this,
don't you know?

322
00:49:35,494 --> 00:49:37,734
Uh, Thunderclap, I found someone!
Over here!

323
00:49:42,768 --> 00:49:45,536
You know, we could
use your help, friend.

324
00:49:45,537 --> 00:49:46,743
Uh...

325
00:49:53,378 --> 00:49:56,620
Whoa!
Yeah! That is great.

326
00:50:02,421 --> 00:50:03,688
It's a critter.

327
00:50:03,689 --> 00:50:06,663
Ah! A freed critter.
Thanks to you.

328
00:50:16,635 --> 00:50:18,636
You know, I just want
to take a moment

329
00:50:18,637 --> 00:50:20,877
and thank the storm
for this meal.

330
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:31,582
Don't think
you can mess with me.

331
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:34,919
I've seen
the eye of the storm!

332
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,954
And I forgot
what fear is!

333
00:50:36,955 --> 00:50:39,690
I'm not afraid
of anything.

334
00:50:39,691 --> 00:50:41,726
No,
I didn't say you were.

335
00:50:41,727 --> 00:50:43,728
Hey, where are
you going, friend?

336
00:50:43,729 --> 00:50:46,464
I'm... I need
to get home.

337
00:50:46,465 --> 00:50:49,205
And I said
we would get you home.

338
00:50:52,371 --> 00:50:55,573
Friend, you have
a critter of your own.

339
00:50:55,574 --> 00:50:57,908
Oh, I smell it.
One of the juicy ones.

340
00:50:57,909 --> 00:50:59,443
Where is it?

341
00:50:59,444 --> 00:51:02,786
He's hiding. Over there.
By that big rock.

342
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:17,033
The storm provides.
No!

343
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:22,800
- Spot!
- Get him!

344
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:32,649
Hey, slow down.
There's no place to hide, yellow belly.

345
00:51:34,446 --> 00:51:35,926
Come back
with that critter!

346
00:51:37,749 --> 00:51:39,723
Help! Help!

347
00:51:43,622 --> 00:51:45,161
Help!

348
00:52:21,493 --> 00:52:24,829
Hey, you okay, kid?
Yes.

349
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:25,730
I hate those kind.

350
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:28,666
Lying sons of crawdads
picking on a kid.

351
00:52:33,538 --> 00:52:35,018
Well, ain't you
just the cutest thing.

352
00:52:38,977 --> 00:52:40,878
He likes you.

353
00:52:40,879 --> 00:52:44,882
Imagine that, Ramsey.
Even with your stinky face.

354
00:52:44,883 --> 00:52:50,054
Nash! Boundaries.
This is my personal bubble.

355
00:52:50,055 --> 00:52:52,823
Nah, that ain't your bubble.
This is your bubble.

356
00:52:55,861 --> 00:52:58,134
Nash, get out of
your sister's bubble.

357
00:53:00,899 --> 00:53:03,567
You got no business
being out here.

358
00:53:03,568 --> 00:53:06,971
Yes, sir. I don't.
I'm trying to get home, but I lost the river.

359
00:53:06,972 --> 00:53:08,906
Please, my momma needs me.

360
00:53:08,907 --> 00:53:10,574
Take it easy, kid.

361
00:53:10,575 --> 00:53:11,742
Do you know
where the river is?

362
00:53:11,743 --> 00:53:15,079
What river?
There's tons of rivers around these parts.

363
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,848
By Clawtooth Mountain.
It has three points.

364
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:19,550
Don't know that one.

365
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:21,652
We're heading south
to a watering hole.

366
00:53:21,653 --> 00:53:23,854
Come with us.
Someone there might help you.

367
00:53:23,855 --> 00:53:26,056
We ain't got time
for baby-sitting,

368
00:53:26,057 --> 00:53:28,098
we got longhorns
to round up.

369
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:33,130
My genius brother
lost our whole herd in one day.

370
00:53:33,131 --> 00:53:36,967
I did not
lose them, Ramsey.

371
00:53:36,968 --> 00:53:40,604
How many times I got to tell you this?
They just wandered off.

372
00:53:40,605 --> 00:53:43,607
We still got to find them.
We can't help you, kid.

373
00:53:43,608 --> 00:53:45,782
Wait! But what if
we could help you?

374
00:53:47,145 --> 00:53:50,114
Spot can sniff out anything.
I've seen him do it.

375
00:53:50,115 --> 00:53:51,682
He can find your longhorns.

376
00:53:51,683 --> 00:53:52,856
Hey!

377
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:56,126
Come on, Spot.
Sniff it out, boy.

378
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:02,098
Good boy, Spot.

379
00:54:23,048 --> 00:54:24,420
He's got something.

380
00:54:28,653 --> 00:54:30,187
Aw, dang.

381
00:54:30,188 --> 00:54:33,057
Hey, kid, if you're
pulling my leg,

382
00:54:33,058 --> 00:54:34,898
I'm gonna eat yours.

383
00:54:42,701 --> 00:54:44,068
He found the herd.

384
00:54:44,069 --> 00:54:46,176
Whoo-whee! We got 'em.

385
00:54:47,138 --> 00:54:49,913
Wait, do longhorns
have feathers?

386
00:54:51,676 --> 00:54:52,982
Rustlers.

387
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,385
Rustlers?

388
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,023
We got to move.

389
00:55:00,085 --> 00:55:01,391
Yah!

390
00:55:37,255 --> 00:55:39,790
I don't see
any rustlers.

391
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:41,364
They're out there.

392
00:55:53,271 --> 00:55:55,940
So, how far did you say
that watering hole was?

393
00:55:55,941 --> 00:55:57,074
I got a job for you.

394
00:55:57,075 --> 00:55:59,109
I'm not really good at jobs.

395
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:01,879
I need you to keep on the dodge
and sidle up the loblolly,

396
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,281
past them hornheads
just hooting and a hollering,

397
00:56:04,282 --> 00:56:06,050
and score off them rustlers.

398
00:56:06,051 --> 00:56:07,957
We'll cut dirt and
get the bulge on them.

399
00:56:08,286 --> 00:56:09,987
What?

400
00:56:09,988 --> 00:56:12,262
He just wants you to get
on that rock and scream.

401
00:56:14,259 --> 00:56:16,093
Uh, but who's
out there?

402
00:56:16,094 --> 00:56:19,730
They'll come right at you.
You hold your ground.
Don't move.

403
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:22,032
Don't move?
What if they have claws and big teeth?

404
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:23,539
Don't overthink it.

405
00:57:28,767 --> 00:57:30,073
Howdy.

406
00:57:33,004 --> 00:57:35,372
What are you up to, boy?
Nothing.

407
00:57:35,373 --> 00:57:39,176
Nothing? Oh!
What's your name?

408
00:57:39,177 --> 00:57:40,944
Uh, Arlo.

409
00:57:40,945 --> 00:57:43,781
Well, Arlo,

410
00:57:43,782 --> 00:57:46,016
you don't look like
you're doing nothing.

411
00:57:46,017 --> 00:57:48,318
What's he look like
he's doing to you, Lurleane?

412
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,287
Oh, come on,
Bubbha. Ask me.

413
00:57:50,288 --> 00:57:51,955
Ask me what I think
they're doing.

414
00:57:51,956 --> 00:57:54,124
Pervis, shut your mouth!

415
00:57:55,827 --> 00:57:58,162
Ah, looks like
he's trespassing.

416
00:57:58,163 --> 00:58:02,105
And what do we do with
trespassers? Tell them, Earl.

417
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,334
We kill them!

418
00:58:10,975 --> 00:58:12,382
I got you!

419
00:58:19,317 --> 00:58:23,159
Nash, the herd!
Yah! Yah!

420
00:58:23,888 --> 00:58:26,662
Yah! Giddy up. Come on now.
Giddy up! Yah!

421
00:58:27,025 --> 00:58:29,098
Watch out!

422
00:58:31,029 --> 00:58:33,097
Nobody steals our longhorns.

423
00:58:33,098 --> 00:58:34,570
Finders keepers.

424
00:58:38,837 --> 00:58:41,077
Yee-ha!

425
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:57,087
Come on now. Momma
wants to play with you.

426
00:58:59,357 --> 00:59:02,131
I know you're there.
I can smell you.

427
00:59:24,015 --> 00:59:25,215
Oh.

428
00:59:25,216 --> 00:59:28,352
Oh, shoot!
That's my favorite tooth!

429
00:59:28,353 --> 00:59:31,594
I'm gonna love ending you!

430
00:59:52,343 --> 00:59:55,145
Come on, we got to drive
this herd out of here.

431
00:59:55,146 --> 00:59:57,420
Yah! Come on now.

432
01:00:26,277 --> 01:00:28,518
Aren't you the cutest?

433
01:00:30,081 --> 01:00:32,622
You and that critter
showed real grit today.

434
01:00:34,018 --> 01:00:37,154
We could use that critter.
How about we trade?

435
01:00:37,155 --> 01:00:38,989
I'll give you my
harmonica for him.

436
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:41,959
Thanks, but Spot
ain't for trading.

437
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,233
Come here, Spot.
Come here.

438
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:50,239
Your loss.

439
01:00:55,206 --> 01:00:59,076
That's a good one.
Gonna scar up real good.

440
01:00:59,077 --> 01:01:01,178
That's nothing.
Look at this!

441
01:01:01,179 --> 01:01:03,680
I run into 15
outlaw stegos.

442
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:07,284
They're all bigger than me
and meaner than me.

443
01:01:07,285 --> 01:01:08,251
What happened?

444
01:01:08,252 --> 01:01:11,088
Fought 'em off, of course.
Was winning, too.

445
01:01:11,089 --> 01:01:13,290
Then one gets his
dang spikey tail

446
01:01:13,291 --> 01:01:15,692
stuck in my foot
and pulls!

447
01:01:15,693 --> 01:01:18,495
Whoa.
Still can't feel my toes.

448
01:01:20,164 --> 01:01:21,498
Which comes in handy

449
01:01:21,499 --> 01:01:23,100
when you're
kicking piles of bull...

450
01:01:23,101 --> 01:01:24,568
She's jealous.

451
01:01:24,569 --> 01:01:26,303
Jealous? Ha!

452
01:01:26,304 --> 01:01:29,706
Once a stampede of longhorns
was coming right at me,

453
01:01:29,707 --> 01:01:32,676
but my tail was stuck between
a rock and a hard place.

454
01:01:32,677 --> 01:01:35,379
I was dead for sure.

455
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:37,420
So I chewed
the dang thing off!

456
01:01:37,582 --> 01:01:38,715
Who does that?

457
01:01:38,716 --> 01:01:41,151
Nobody does that!

458
01:01:41,152 --> 01:01:42,352
You're crazy!

459
01:01:42,353 --> 01:01:43,720
I'm surprised
you don't have one

460
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:46,189
right across your face.

461
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,525
Butch, how'd you
get your scar?

462
01:01:48,526 --> 01:01:51,194
I don't know
if you're ready for that story.

463
01:01:51,195 --> 01:01:52,462
I can take it.

464
01:01:52,463 --> 01:01:53,497
Oh, yeah.
You got to tell him, Pa!

465
01:01:53,498 --> 01:01:54,631
That's a good one!

466
01:02:00,171 --> 01:02:02,739
It was 100 degrees
in the shade.

467
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:05,742
I walked for five
days with no water.

468
01:02:05,743 --> 01:02:08,645
Then I saw it.
A pretty pond.

469
01:02:08,646 --> 01:02:11,214
I bent down to take a drink,

470
01:02:11,215 --> 01:02:13,283
when these crocs
launched out of the water.

471
01:02:13,284 --> 01:02:15,318
One croc bit me on the face.

472
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:19,556
Ain't no way I wasn't its
supper except for one thing,

473
01:02:19,557 --> 01:02:22,592
I wasn't ready
for dying that day.

474
01:02:22,593 --> 01:02:24,528
I bit one croc in half,

475
01:02:24,529 --> 01:02:25,529
tail-whipped the other,

476
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,264
and the last one...

477
01:02:27,265 --> 01:02:31,735
Well, I drowned that croc
in my own blood.

478
01:02:31,736 --> 01:02:34,304
- Whoa.
- Dang!

479
01:02:34,305 --> 01:02:37,507
Ooh! Look, look,
gives me little goosies every time.

480
01:02:37,508 --> 01:02:39,409
I love that story!

481
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:40,750
Show him your souvenir.

482
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,648
Ain't that just too good?

483
01:02:44,649 --> 01:02:46,283
Can I touch it
this time?

484
01:02:46,284 --> 01:02:48,385
No.

485
01:02:48,386 --> 01:02:51,321
Huh. You guys would have
liked my poppa.

486
01:02:51,322 --> 01:02:53,496
He wasn't scared of anything.

487
01:02:53,758 --> 01:02:56,293
I'm done being scared.

488
01:02:56,294 --> 01:02:57,761
Who said I'm not scared?

489
01:02:57,762 --> 01:02:59,329
But you took on a croc!

490
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:01,498
And I was scared doing it.

491
01:03:01,499 --> 01:03:04,334
If you ain't scared of a croc
biting you on the face,

492
01:03:04,335 --> 01:03:07,671
you ain't alive.
Listen, kid,

493
01:03:07,672 --> 01:03:11,441
you can't get rid of fear.
It's like Mother Nature,

494
01:03:11,442 --> 01:03:13,610
you can't beat her
or outrun her,

495
01:03:13,611 --> 01:03:15,679
but you can get through it.

496
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,820
You can find out
what you're made of.

497
01:03:21,786 --> 01:03:23,526
The first snow.

498
01:03:24,689 --> 01:03:26,756
It's early this year.

499
01:03:26,757 --> 01:03:28,592
And I got to
get home to Momma.

500
01:03:28,593 --> 01:03:30,360
We'll get you to
that watering hole.

501
01:03:30,361 --> 01:03:33,769
A deal's a deal.
At first light, we ride.

502
01:03:36,501 --> 01:03:38,040
Let's go!
Yah!

503
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,015
Hey, kid, head 'em off
before those longhorns split.

504
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,627
Yah!

505
01:04:38,429 --> 01:04:39,869
There it is!

506
01:04:40,431 --> 01:04:41,631
Clawtooth Mountain!

507
01:04:41,632 --> 01:04:42,899
There's home!

508
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,701
Whoo-whee!

509
01:04:44,702 --> 01:04:46,803
We've got to drive
this herd down south.

510
01:04:46,804 --> 01:04:48,572
You hurry on
back to your momma.

511
01:04:48,573 --> 01:04:50,674
And don't stop
for nothing!

512
01:04:50,675 --> 01:04:54,377
Thanks! I sure appreciate you
looking out for me!

513
01:04:54,378 --> 01:04:57,019
You'll be all right.
You're one tough kid.

514
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:13,602
Oh!

515
01:05:33,517 --> 01:05:34,790
Whoa!

516
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:38,961
Whoo-hoo!

517
01:06:11,689 --> 01:06:13,095
Whoo!

518
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:24,106
Whoa.

519
01:06:41,886 --> 01:06:43,692
Wow.

520
01:06:54,565 --> 01:06:57,834
It's so close.
We're almost there, Spot!

521
01:08:12,777 --> 01:08:14,216
We need to get home.

522
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:30,994
You're gonna
love it, Spot.

523
01:08:30,995 --> 01:08:34,531
You'll have a warm place to sleep.
Right next to me.

524
01:08:34,532 --> 01:08:36,132
And all the corn
you can eat.

525
01:08:36,133 --> 01:08:38,807
There's lots of space
to run around.

526
01:08:39,537 --> 01:08:41,604
It'll be your farm, too.

527
01:08:41,605 --> 01:08:43,779
We'll all look
after it together.

528
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:02,331
I can't.

529
01:10:06,624 --> 01:10:08,130
No!

530
01:10:10,694 --> 01:10:12,100
Spot!

531
01:10:18,836 --> 01:10:20,309
Spot!

532
01:10:30,681 --> 01:10:32,020
Spot!

533
01:10:37,855 --> 01:10:40,095
No! Spot!

534
01:11:02,279 --> 01:11:03,919
Poppa?

535
01:11:07,985 --> 01:11:09,324
Poppa?

536
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:18,861
You're alive?

537
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:21,069
I can't
believe it. It's you.

538
01:11:31,141 --> 01:11:33,382
My friend! Spot!

539
01:11:34,745 --> 01:11:37,085
He helped me and
now he's in trouble.

540
01:11:38,782 --> 01:11:40,022
We have to go back.

541
01:11:41,085 --> 01:11:42,257
Poppa, stop.

542
01:11:44,321 --> 01:11:45,961
Stop!

543
01:11:49,126 --> 01:11:50,432
Poppa?

544
01:12:08,278 --> 01:12:11,186
You're not here.

545
01:12:17,154 --> 01:12:19,061
I'm scared.

546
01:12:21,058 --> 01:12:23,131
But Spot needs me.

547
01:12:25,062 --> 01:12:28,765
I blamed him for
what happened to you,

548
01:12:28,766 --> 01:12:30,205
but it wasn't his fault.

549
01:12:34,271 --> 01:12:36,372
So I got to go help him.

550
01:12:37,808 --> 01:12:41,116
Because I love him.

551
01:12:46,984 --> 01:12:49,024
I knew you had it in you.

552
01:12:52,289 --> 01:12:55,097
You're me and more.

553
01:12:57,361 --> 01:13:00,102
Now go take care
of that critter.

554
01:14:09,032 --> 01:14:11,106
Back off!

555
01:14:23,881 --> 01:14:26,588
Well, look who
got relevated.

556
01:14:33,357 --> 01:14:35,597
Go get him.

557
01:14:38,462 --> 01:14:39,734
Spot.

558
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,339
Spot!

559
01:15:13,263 --> 01:15:15,170
The storm provides.

560
01:16:01,311 --> 01:16:03,218
Spot!

561
01:16:05,082 --> 01:16:06,555
Spot!

562
01:16:27,471 --> 01:16:29,578
Spot!

563
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:10,405
We're home, Spot.

564
01:24:21,077 --> 01:24:22,784
Henry?

565
01:24:29,552 --> 01:24:30,925
Arlo.

566
01:24:32,555 --> 01:24:34,862
Arlo!
