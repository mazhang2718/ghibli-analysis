1
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,960
Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.

2
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:56,055
'Cause of something that happened
before I was even born.

3
00:00:56,627 --> 00:01:00,301
See, a long time ago,
there was this family.

4
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:03,384
The Papá, he was a musician.

5
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:06,914
He and his family
would sing and dance

6
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:08,328
and count their blessings.

7
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:10,646
But he also had a dream.

8
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:12,939
To play for the world.

9
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:17,066
And one day...

10
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:19,716
he left with his guitar...

11
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:22,550
and never returned.

12
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:28,373
And my Mamá...

13
00:01:28,627 --> 00:01:31,666
She didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.

14
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:36,841
After banishing all music
from her life...

15
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:40,143
she found a way
to provide for her daughter.

16
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:45,968
She rolled up her sleeves...

17
00:01:46,134 --> 00:01:48,007
and she learned to make shoes.

18
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,591
She could have made candy.

19
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:56,448
O-o-or fireworks.

20
00:01:57,114 --> 00:01:59,329
Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers.

21
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:01,940
But no.

22
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:03,496
She chose shoes.

23
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,192
Then she taught
her daughter to make shoes.

24
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,089
And later, she taught
her son-in-law.

25
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:15,454
Then her grandkids got roped in.

26
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:19,732
As her family grew,
so did the business.

27
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:23,899
Music have torn
her family apart.

28
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:27,129
But shoes held
them all together.

29
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,708
You see that woman...

30
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,272
was my great-great-grandmother...

31
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:33,455
Mamá Imelda.

32
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:36,836
She died way before I was born.

33
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:39,408
But my family still
tells her story...

34
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,559
every year. And her little girl...

35
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:44,306
she's my great-grandmother,
Mamá Coco.

36
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,655
Hola, Mamá Coco.

37
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:48,798
How are you, Julio?

38
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:50,980
Actually, my name is Miguel.

39
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:54,703
Mamá Coco has trouble
remembering things.

40
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,845
But it's good to talk to her,
anyway.

41
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,869
So, I tell her
pretty much everything.

42
00:02:58,894 --> 00:03:00,529
I used to run like this.

43
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:03,172
But now I run like this,
it's just way faster.

44
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:06,251
The winner is...
luchadora Coco!

45
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:09,022
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.

46
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:11,284
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.

47
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:13,110
Miguel, eat your food.

48
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:15,515
My abuelita, she's
Mamá Coco's daughter.

49
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:18,610
Aw, you're a twig, mijo.
Have some more.

50
00:03:18,635 --> 00:03:19,729
No, gracias.

51
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:22,302
I asked if you would like
more tamales.

52
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:23,960
S-Si?

53
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:26,143
That's what I thought you said!

54
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:30,366
Abuelita runs the house
just as Mamá Imelda did.

55
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:33,454
No music!

56
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:36,358
No music!

57
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,453
♪ aunque la vida ♪

58
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:39,351
No music!

59
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:42,971
I think we're the only family
in Mexico who hates music.

60
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:45,027
And my family's fine with that.

61
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:45,972
But me...

62
00:03:45,997 --> 00:03:47,274
Be back by lunch, mijo.

63
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:48,473
Love you, Mamá!

64
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:51,957
I'm <i>not</i> like the rest
of my family.

65
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,028
- Hola, Miguel.
- Hola.

66
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:02,934
- Muchas gracias!
- De nada, Miguel!

67
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,775
He-hey, Dante!

68
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,291
Sit.

69
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:11,299
Down.

70
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:12,418
Roll over.

71
00:04:12,443 --> 00:04:13,419
Shake.

72
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:14,974
Fist bump.

73
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,332
Good boy, Dante!

74
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:23,076
I know, I'm not supposed
to love music.

75
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,060
But it's not my fault.

76
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:26,742
It's his.

77
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:28,822
Ernesto de la Cruz.

78
00:04:28,846 --> 00:04:31,718
The greatest musician
of all time.

79
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:35,668
Here in this very plaza,
the young Ernesto de la Cruz

80
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:38,082
took his first steps
toward becoming

81
00:04:38,107 --> 00:04:41,328
the most beloved singer
in Mexican history.

82
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:45,716
He started out a total nobody
from Santa Cecilia, like me.

83
00:04:46,773 --> 00:04:48,241
But when he played music,

84
00:04:48,265 --> 00:04:50,899
he made people
fall in love with him.

85
00:04:53,574 --> 00:04:55,424
He starred in movies.

86
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:57,900
He had the coolest guitar.

87
00:04:58,487 --> 00:04:59,670
He could fly!

88
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:02,535
And he wrote the best songs.

89
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:04,662
But my all-time favorite is...

90
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:07,582
♪ Remember me ♪

91
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:08,938
♪ Remember me ♪

92
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:10,622
♪ Though I have to say goodbye ♪

93
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,043
♪ Remember me ♪

94
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:15,430
♪ Me ♪

95
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:17,011
Until 1942.

96
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:22,255
When he was crushed
by a giant bell.

97
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:25,279
I wanna be just like him.

98
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,503
Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz...

99
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:35,686
and I get this feeling.

100
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,710
Like we're connected somehow.

101
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,757
Like if he could play music...

102
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:42,574
maybe someday, I could too!

103
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:47,194
If it wasn't for my family.

104
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:49,060
Ay, ay, ay, muchacho!

105
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:50,044
Huh?

106
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:52,052
I asked for a shoe shine,
not your life story.

107
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:53,592
Oh, yeah, sorry.

108
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:56,956
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home, so.

109
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,361
Look, if I were you,

110
00:05:59,386 --> 00:06:01,361
I'd march right up
to my family and say,

111
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:03,846
"Hey, I'm a musician.
Deal with it!"

112
00:06:03,871 --> 00:06:05,513
I could never say that.

113
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:07,863
You are a musician, no?

114
00:06:07,888 --> 00:06:09,275
I-I-I don't know.

115
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,761
I mean, I only really
play for myself.

116
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:14,952
Ah! Did de la Cruz become
the world's best musician

117
00:06:14,977 --> 00:06:17,159
by hiding his sweet,
sweet skills?

118
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:18,207
No!

119
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:20,294
He walked out onto that plaza

120
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,437
and he played out loud!

121
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:24,605
Ah, Mira, Mira, they're
setting up for tonight.

122
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,494
The music competition for
Día de Muertos.

123
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,352
You wanna be like your hero?
You should sign up!

124
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:33,177
Unh-unh. My family would freak!

125
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,939
Look, if you're too scared,
then, well, have fun making shoes.

126
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:41,011
Come on, what did
de la Cruz always say?

127
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:43,257
Seize your moment?

128
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:47,130
Show me what you got,
muchacho.

129
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:50,019
I'll be your first audience.

130
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:58,504
Miguel!

131
00:06:58,529 --> 00:06:59,361
Ah!

132
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:01,305
Abuelita!

133
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,909
What are you doing here?

134
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:04,719
Um... oh... uh...

135
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:06,481
You leave my grandson alone!

136
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:09,236
Doña, please! I was just
getting a shine.

137
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:10,823
I know your tricks, mariachi.

138
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:11,999
What did he say to you?

139
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:13,665
He was just showing me
his guitar.

140
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,278
Shame on you!

141
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,968
My grandson is a
is a sweet little

142
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:21,397
angelito, perrito, cielito!

143
00:07:21,422 --> 00:07:24,048
He wants no part
of your music, mariachi.

144
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:25,700
You keep away from him.

145
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:27,708
Y-ay!

146
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:31,263
Ay, pobrecito!

147
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:33,509
Estas bien, mijo.

148
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,406
You know better than
to be here in this place.

149
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:40,993
You will come home.
Now.

150
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,897
How many times
have we told you?

151
00:07:52,922 --> 00:07:55,151
That plaza is crawling
with mariachis.

152
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:56,946
Yes, Tío Berto.

153
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,375
No, no, no, no, no.

154
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,557
Hey, go away, you. Go!

155
00:08:00,582 --> 00:08:02,035
It's just Dante.

156
00:08:02,122 --> 00:08:03,892
Never name a street dog.

157
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,304
They'll follow you forever.

158
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:07,171
Now, go get my shoe.

159
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:15,954
I found your son in
Mariachi Plaza.

160
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:17,382
Ay, Miguel?

161
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,645
You know how abuelita
feels about the plaza.

162
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,938
I was just shining shoes.

163
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:22,495
A musician's shoes.

164
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,748
But the plaza's where
the foot traffic is.

165
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:30,533
If abuelita says, "No more plaza",
then no more plaza.

166
00:08:30,558 --> 00:08:31,828
But what about tonight?

167
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:32,822
What's tonight?

168
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,733
Well, they're having
this talent show.

169
00:08:35,758 --> 00:08:38,768
- A-and I thought I might...
- Sign up?

170
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:40,900
Well, maybe?

171
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:43,713
You have to have talent
to be in a talent show.

172
00:08:43,738 --> 00:08:46,643
What are you gonna do?
Shine shoes? Oh!

173
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:49,849
It's Día de los Muertos.
No one's going any where.

174
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:51,692
Tonight is about family.

175
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,406
Ofrenda room. Vámonos.

176
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:07,009
Don't give me that look.

177
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:09,605
Día de los Muertos is the
one night of the year

178
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:11,898
our ancestors can come visit us.

179
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:13,867
We put their photos
on the ofrenda

180
00:09:13,892 --> 00:09:15,955
so their spririts can cross over.

181
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,924
That is very important.

182
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:20,662
If we don't put them up,
they can't come.

183
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,147
We made all this food.

184
00:09:22,172 --> 00:09:25,267
Set out the things
they loved in life, mijo.

185
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:28,656
All this work to
bring the family together.

186
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:31,260
I don't want you sneaking off
to who-knows-where.

187
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:33,403
Huh! Where are you going?

188
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:35,974
- I thought we were done.
- Ay, Dios mío.

189
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,554
Being part of this family means
being here for this family.

190
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,174
I don't want to see you
end up like...

191
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,627
Like Mamá Coco's papá?

192
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:45,318
Never mention that man!

193
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:46,485
He's better off forgotten.

194
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,826
- But you're the one who...
- Eh, thchhsss!

195
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:49,264
- I was just...
- Tchsshh!

196
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:49,986
- But...
- Tchshh.

197
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:50,756
- I...
- Shhh.

198
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:51,971
Papá?

199
00:09:51,996 --> 00:09:53,702
Papá is home?

200
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,146
Mamá, cálmese, cálmese.

201
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:57,950
Papá is coming home?

202
00:09:57,975 --> 00:10:01,697
No, Mamá, it's okay.
I'm here.

203
00:10:02,562 --> 00:10:03,935
Who are you?

204
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,689
Ay... rest, Mamá.

205
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,292
I'm hard on you
because I care, Miguel.

206
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:11,880
Miguel?

207
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:13,538
Miguel?

208
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,316
Ay.

209
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:18,229
What are we going to do
with that boy?

210
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,102
Ha ha ha, you're right.

211
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:23,285
That's just what he needs.

212
00:10:45,674 --> 00:10:46,667
Huah!

213
00:10:47,087 --> 00:10:49,071
Oh, it's you. Get in here.

214
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:50,761
Come on, Dante. Hurry up.

215
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:54,262
You're gonna get me
in trouble, boy.

216
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,840
Someone can hear me.

217
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:01,969
I wish someone
wanted to hear me.

218
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,850
Other than you.

219
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:06,755
Ew, okay!

220
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:09,930
Perfecto.

221
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:44,667
<i>I have to sing.</i>

222
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:46,271
<i>I have to play.</i>

223
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:49,080
<i>The music, it's...
it's not just in me.</i>

224
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:51,066
<i>It </i>is<i> me.</i>

225
00:11:52,383 --> 00:11:54,050
<i>When life gets me down.</i>

226
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:55,637
<i>I play my guitar.</i>

227
00:11:56,497 --> 00:11:59,814
<i>The rest of the world may
follow the rules, but I...</i>

228
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,822
<i>must follow my heart.</i>

229
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,234
Ugh.

230
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:04,776
<i>You know that feeling...</i>

231
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:06,386
<i>like there's a song in the air</i>

232
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:08,601
<i>and it's playing just for you?</i>

233
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,972
<i>♪ A feeling so close ♪</i>

234
00:12:14,997 --> 00:12:19,045
<i>♪ You could reach out
and touch it ♪</i>

235
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,886
<i>♪ I never knew ♪</i>

236
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:24,626
<i>♪ I could want something
so much ♪</i>

237
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:26,292
<i>♪ But it's true ♪</i>

238
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:28,556
<i>You must have faith, sister.</i>

239
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,897
<i>Oh, but Padre,
he will never listen.</i>

240
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:33,097
<i>He will listen to music!</i>

241
00:12:33,137 --> 00:12:35,930
<i>♪ Only a song, only a song ♪</i>

242
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:39,724
<i>♪ Has the power
to change a heart ♪</i>

243
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,425
<i>Never underestimate
the power of music.</i>

244
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:52,337
<i>But my father,</i>

245
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:54,130
<i>he will never give
his permission.</i>

246
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:56,321
<i>I am done
asking permission.</i>

247
00:12:56,346 --> 00:12:57,425
<i>When you see your moment,</i>

248
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,044
<i>you mustn't let it pass you by.</i>

249
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,124
<i>You must seize it.</i>

250
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,512
<i>Señor de la Cruz,</i>

251
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:05,076
<i>what did it take for you
to seize your moment?</i>

252
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:09,560
<i>I had to have faith
in my dream.</i>

253
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:11,600
<i>No one was going to hand it to me.</i>

254
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,043
<i>It was up to me to
reach for that dream.</i>

255
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:15,662
<i>Grab it tight...</i>

256
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:17,646
<i>and make it come true.</i>

257
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,942
No more hiding, Dante.

258
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25,617
I gotta seize my moment.

259
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:29,738
I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza
if it kills me.

260
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:36,394
Día de Muertos has begun!

261
00:13:36,822 --> 00:13:38,346
No, no, no, no, no.

262
00:13:38,371 --> 00:13:40,274
We have to make a clear path.

263
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:42,588
The petals guide
our ancestors home.

264
00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:51,661
- Mamá!
- Hunh!

265
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:53,177
Where should we put this table?

266
00:13:53,202 --> 00:13:54,409
In the courtyard, mijos.

267
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,695
You want it down
by the kitchen?

268
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,394
Si, eh, next to the other one.

269
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:01,950
Get under, get under!

270
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:03,799
Miguel?

271
00:14:03,824 --> 00:14:04,776
Uh, nothing.

272
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:07,086
Mamá, Papá, I...

273
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:09,222
Miguel, your abuelita have

274
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:12,118
the most wonderful idea.

275
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,531
We've all decided...

276
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:16,286
it's time you joined us
in the workshop!

277
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:17,097
What?

278
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,802
No more shining shoes.

279
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:21,654
You will be making them,
every day, after school.

280
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:24,614
Oh, our Miguelitititito

281
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,344
carrying on the family tradition.

282
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:29,368
And on Día de los Muertos!

283
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:32,464
Your ancestors
would be so proud.

284
00:14:32,528 --> 00:14:35,989
You'll craft huaraches
just like your Tía Victoria.

285
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:38,647
And wing tips just like
your Papá Julio.

286
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:41,466
But what if I'm no good
at making shoes?

287
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:42,871
Ay, Miguel.

288
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:45,317
You have your family here
to guide you.

289
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,658
You are a Rivera.

290
00:14:47,683 --> 00:14:50,612
And a Rivera is?

291
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:52,636
A shoemaker...

292
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,691
through and through.

293
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:55,064
That's my boy!

294
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:57,945
Haha! Berto!
Break out the good stuff!

295
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,748
Mm, mm, mm, mwah!

296
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:11,154
Dante!

297
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,273
No, Dante, stop!

298
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:19,911
Hunh!

299
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,204
Ah!

300
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:24,883
No, no, no, no, no!

301
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:26,796
No.

302
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:41,246
De la Cruz' guitar?

303
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:42,492
Ah?

304
00:15:43,214 --> 00:15:44,555
Papá?

305
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:46,798
Mamá Coco.

306
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:49,695
Is your papá Ernesto de la Cruz?

307
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,345
Papá! Papá!

308
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,522
Haha!

309
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,783
Papá, Papá!

310
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:06,037
It's him!

311
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:07,808
I know who my
great-great-grandfather was!

312
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,753
Miguel, get down from there.

313
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:12,324
Mamá Coco's father
was Ernesto de la Cruz!

314
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:13,960
What are you talking about?

315
00:16:13,985 --> 00:16:15,817
I'm gonna be a musician!

316
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:19,049
What is all this?

317
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:21,327
You keep secrets
from your own family?

318
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:23,272
It's all that time he spends
in the plaza.

319
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:25,233
Fills his head
with crazy fantasies.

320
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:26,464
It's not a fantasy.

321
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:28,718
That man was
Ernesto de la Cruz.

322
00:16:28,743 --> 00:16:30,441
The greatest musician
of all time.

323
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:32,267
We've never known
anything about this man.

324
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,847
Or whoever he was,
he still abandoned his family.

325
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:37,268
It's no future for my son.

326
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:40,283
Well, Papá, y-you said
my family would guide me.

327
00:16:40,308 --> 00:16:42,547
Well, de la Cruz <i>is</i> my family.

328
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:44,284
I'm supposed to play music.

329
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:46,745
Never! That man's music
was a curse.

330
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:48,332
I will not allow it.

331
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:50,205
- If you would just...
- Miguel.

332
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,460
You will listen to your family.

333
00:16:51,485 --> 00:16:53,230
No more music.

334
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:54,499
Just listen to me play.

335
00:16:54,524 --> 00:16:55,905
End of argument.

336
00:16:57,646 --> 00:16:59,511
You want to end up
like that man?

337
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:00,695
Forgotten?

338
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,964
Left off your family's ofrenda?

339
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,157
I don't care if I'm on some
stupid ofrenda.

340
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:07,149
- Hunh!
- Hunh!

341
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:10,227
- No!
- Mamá!

342
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:15,804
There.

343
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,145
No guitar.

344
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:18,636
No music.

345
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,796
Aw, come.

346
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,073
You'll feel better after
you eat with your family.

347
00:17:26,098 --> 00:17:27,772
I don't wanna be in this family!

348
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:30,130
Miguel, Miguel!

349
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,537
I-I wanna play in the plaza.

350
00:17:50,562 --> 00:17:51,609
Like de la Cruz.

351
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,079
C-can I still sign up?

352
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:54,148
You got an instrument?

353
00:17:54,244 --> 00:17:56,839
No. But if I can borrow a guitar.

354
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:58,807
Musicians gotta bring
their own instruments.

355
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:01,658
You find a guitar, kid,
I'll put you on the list.

356
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:06,608
Hey, excuse me,
can I borrow your guitar?

357
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:07,957
Sorry, muchaco.

358
00:18:07,982 --> 00:18:09,513
You guys have a spare guitar?

359
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:10,465
No.

360
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,818
I need a guitar
just for a little bit.

361
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,395
Get outta here, kid.

362
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:29,089
Great-great-grandfather.

363
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,422
What am I supposed to do?

364
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:11,411
No, no, no, no.
Dante, stop.

365
00:19:11,436 --> 00:19:13,498
Cállate, shh.

366
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:36,423
I'm sorry.

367
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:14,314
Señor de la Cruz.

368
00:20:15,306 --> 00:20:16,742
Please don't be mad.

369
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,258
I-I'm Miguel.

370
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,085
Your great-great-grandson.

371
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:22,664
I-I need to borrow this.

372
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,045
Our family thinks
music is a curse.

373
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:31,698
None of them understand.
But I know you would have.

374
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:34,389
You would have told me
to follow my heart.

375
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:36,413
To seize my moment.

376
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,198
So, if it's all right with you...

377
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:41,881
I'm gonna play in the Plaza.

378
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:43,762
Just like you did!

379
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:52,955
Huh?

380
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,416
What's going on?

381
00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:56,178
Somebody stole
de la Cruz' guitar.

382
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:58,780
The window is broken, look!

383
00:21:03,113 --> 00:21:04,613
All right, who's in there?

384
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,669
I'm sorry, i-it's not
what it looks like.

385
00:21:06,694 --> 00:21:08,519
De la Cruz is my...

386
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:09,931
Huh!

387
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:11,209
There's nobody here!

388
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:28,312
- Miguel!
- Mamá!

389
00:21:28,463 --> 00:21:30,066
Miguel, come home!

390
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,288
Dios mio, little boy!
Are you okay?

391
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,153
Here, let me help you.

392
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:43,629
Thanks. I...

393
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,343
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

394
00:21:49,463 --> 00:21:50,455
Aah!

395
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,191
Aah!

396
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:55,484
Do you mind?

397
00:21:55,707 --> 00:21:57,112
- Aah!
- Aah!

398
00:22:17,113 --> 00:22:19,438
Look how big she's getting.

399
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:24,661
Uh! Dante?

400
00:22:24,686 --> 00:22:26,009
You can see me?

401
00:22:26,874 --> 00:22:29,343
Wait! What's going on?

402
00:22:29,755 --> 00:22:31,901
Dante! Dante!

403
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:34,004
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

404
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:34,884
Miguel?

405
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:36,813
- Miguel?
- Miguel?

406
00:22:40,183 --> 00:22:41,581
Y-you're here!

407
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:42,636
Here here.

408
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,883
And you can see us?

409
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:46,691
Our Miguelitititito!

410
00:22:46,717 --> 00:22:48,153
Remind me how I know you?

411
00:22:48,178 --> 00:22:49,646
We're your family, mijo.

412
00:22:52,186 --> 00:22:53,678
Tía Rosita?

413
00:22:53,703 --> 00:22:54,964
Si.

414
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:57,901
Papá Julio?

415
00:22:57,944 --> 00:22:59,134
Hola!

416
00:22:59,353 --> 00:23:01,393
Tía Vic...toria?

417
00:23:01,552 --> 00:23:03,718
He doesn't seem
entirely dead.

418
00:23:04,274 --> 00:23:06,289
He's not quite alive, either.

419
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:07,790
We need Mamá Imelda.

420
00:23:07,815 --> 00:23:09,338
She'll know how to fix this.

421
00:23:09,363 --> 00:23:10,544
Oye!

422
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,076
It's Mamá Imelda!

423
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,473
She couldn't cross over!

424
00:23:14,498 --> 00:23:15,307
She's stuck!

425
00:23:15,332 --> 00:23:16,808
On the other side!

426
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:18,299
Tío Oscar?

427
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:19,752
Tío Felipe?

428
00:23:19,783 --> 00:23:21,037
Oh, hey, Miguel.

429
00:23:21,783 --> 00:23:24,457
I have a feeling this has
something to do with you.

430
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:26,275
But if Mamá Imelda
can't come to us...

431
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,061
Then we are going to her!

432
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:29,045
- Whoa!
- Vámonos!

433
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:44,271
Whoa.

434
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:46,938
Come on, Miguel, it's-it's okay.

435
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:00,618
Dante?

436
00:24:00,903 --> 00:24:01,999
Dante!

437
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:04,182
Dante, wait up!

438
00:24:06,698 --> 00:24:08,237
You've gotta stay with me, boy.

439
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,150
You don't know...

440
00:24:10,936 --> 00:24:12,016
where...

441
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,293
This isn't a dream, then.

442
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,172
You're all really out there.

443
00:24:35,197 --> 00:24:36,317
You thought we weren't?

444
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:37,547
Oh, I don't know.

445
00:24:37,572 --> 00:24:39,888
I thought it might have been
one of those made-up things...

446
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:41,541
that adults tell kids, like...

447
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:42,239
vitamins.

448
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:44,548
Miguel, vitamins
are a real thing.

449
00:24:44,573 --> 00:24:46,421
Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.

450
00:24:46,446 --> 00:24:47,359
Hunh!

451
00:24:47,384 --> 00:24:48,930
Mija, it's not nice to stare at...

452
00:24:48,978 --> 00:24:50,756
Ay, Santa Ma...

453
00:24:58,804 --> 00:24:59,923
Are those?

454
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:01,582
Alebrijes!

455
00:25:01,606 --> 00:25:03,606
- But those are...
- Real alebrijes.

456
00:25:03,631 --> 00:25:05,289
Spirit creatures.

457
00:25:05,314 --> 00:25:06,941
They guide souls
on their journey.

458
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:09,591
Watch your step,
they make cacitas everywhere.

459
00:25:09,615 --> 00:25:11,560
<i>Welcome back
to the Land of the Dead.</i>

460
00:25:11,585 --> 00:25:14,290
<i>Please have all offerings
ready for re-entry.</i>

461
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:15,609
Welcome back.

462
00:25:15,634 --> 00:25:16,840
Anything to declare?

463
00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:18,442
Some churros, from my family.

464
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:19,680
How wonderful!

465
00:25:19,704 --> 00:25:22,148
<i>If you're experiencing
travel issues...</i>

466
00:25:22,173 --> 00:25:24,371
<i>Agents at the Department of
Family Reunion</i>

467
00:25:24,396 --> 00:25:26,228
<i>are available to assist you.</i>

468
00:25:26,253 --> 00:25:27,840
Next family, please.

469
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:34,347
Oh, your photos are
in your son's ofrenda.

470
00:25:34,372 --> 00:25:35,395
Have a great visit.

471
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:36,577
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

472
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:38,609
<i>And remember to return
before sunrise.</i>

473
00:25:38,634 --> 00:25:39,832
<i>Enjoy your visit!</i>

474
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:40,800
Next?

475
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:44,060
Your photo's on your
dentist's ofrenda.

476
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:45,497
Enjoy your visit.

477
00:25:45,522 --> 00:25:46,521
Grashiash.

478
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:47,578
Next?

479
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,887
Yes, it is I, Frida Kahlo.

480
00:25:51,912 --> 00:25:53,363
Shall we skip the scanner?

481
00:25:53,388 --> 00:25:54,856
I'm on so many ofrendas

482
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:57,522
it will just overwhelm your
blinky thingy.

483
00:25:58,785 --> 00:25:59,817
Whoa, shoot.

484
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:01,974
Looks like no one
put up your photo...

485
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:03,420
Frida?

486
00:26:03,444 --> 00:26:05,991
Okay, when I said
I was Frida, just now...

487
00:26:06,015 --> 00:26:06,856
That.

488
00:26:06,888 --> 00:26:07,793
That was a lie.

489
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:09,817
And I apologize for doing that.

490
00:26:09,841 --> 00:26:11,841
No photo on an ofrenda,
no crossing the bridge.

491
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:12,754
You know what?

492
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,666
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.

493
00:26:18,175 --> 00:26:19,310
Haha!

494
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:26,448
Almost... there...

495
00:26:26,473 --> 00:26:28,615
Just a little... further...

496
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:31,989
Ugh.

497
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,378
Upsy daisy.

498
00:26:34,403 --> 00:26:36,592
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?

499
00:26:36,784 --> 00:26:38,721
Dumb flower bridge!

500
00:26:38,746 --> 00:26:42,212
Aw, I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.

501
00:26:42,237 --> 00:26:43,046
Next?

502
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:44,841
Oh, come mijo, it's our turn.

503
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:46,460
Welcome back, amigo.

504
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:47,739
Anything to declare?

505
00:26:47,764 --> 00:26:49,572
A-as a matter of fact...

506
00:26:49,628 --> 00:26:50,810
Yes.

507
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:52,375
Hola.

508
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,789
<i>Paging Marta Gonzalez Ramos...</i>

509
00:27:02,146 --> 00:27:03,250
<i>Marta Gonzalez Ramos...</i>

510
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:04,670
<i>Please report to level seven.</i>

511
00:27:09,554 --> 00:27:10,490
Whoa.

512
00:27:14,224 --> 00:27:15,764
I miss my nose.

513
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:26,969
Come on, help us out, amigo.

514
00:27:26,994 --> 00:27:28,755
We gotta get to a
dozen ofrendas tonight.

515
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:31,573
We are not visiting
your ex-wife, Stanley,

516
00:27:31,598 --> 00:27:32,692
por Día de Muertos.

517
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,247
I demand to speak to the
person in charge.

518
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:37,019
I'm sorry, señora, it says here

519
00:27:37,044 --> 00:27:38,328
no one put up your photo.

520
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:42,677
My family always, always
put my photo up in the ofrenda

521
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:45,732
That devil box tells you
nothing but lies.

522
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:47,455
Mamá Imelda?

523
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,305
Oh, mi familia.

524
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,233
They wouldn't let me
cross the bridge.

525
00:27:52,258 --> 00:27:54,677
Tell this woman and her
devil box

526
00:27:54,702 --> 00:27:57,138
that my photo is in the ofrenda.

527
00:27:57,163 --> 00:28:00,568
Well, w-we never
made it to the ofrenda.

528
00:28:00,593 --> 00:28:01,631
What?

529
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:03,235
We ran into a...

530
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,084
um...

531
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:08,358
Hunh! Miguel?

532
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:10,318
Mamá Imelda.

533
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,771
What is going on?

534
00:28:12,795 --> 00:28:15,239
You the Rivera family?

535
00:28:17,032 --> 00:28:18,421
Well, you're cursed.

536
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:19,452
What?

537
00:28:19,477 --> 00:28:21,882
Día de los Muertos
is a night to give to the dead.

538
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:23,429
You stole from the dead.

539
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,247
But I wasn't sealing the guitar.

540
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,239
Guitar?

541
00:28:26,264 --> 00:28:27,477
It was my
great-great-grandfather's.

542
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:28,660
He would have
wanted me to have it.

543
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:31,899
Ah-ah-ah! We do not speak
of that musician.

544
00:28:31,924 --> 00:28:33,924
He is dead to this family.

545
00:28:33,949 --> 00:28:35,764
Uh, you're all dead.

546
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:36,702
Achoo!

547
00:28:36,727 --> 00:28:39,513
I am sorry, uh,
who's alebrije is that?

548
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:40,514
That's Dante.

549
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:42,768
He sure doesn't look
like an alebrije.

550
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:44,380
He just looks like
a plain old dog.

551
00:28:44,405 --> 00:28:46,730
Or a sausage someone
dropped in a barbershop.

552
00:28:46,755 --> 00:28:49,143
Whatever he is, I am-
achoo!

553
00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:50,493
terribly allergic.

554
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:52,391
But Dante doesn't have any hair.

555
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:54,915
And I don't have a nose
and yet here we are.

556
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,130
Achoo!

557
00:28:56,155 --> 00:28:59,884
But none of this explains
why I couldn't cross over.

558
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:01,481
Oh...

559
00:29:02,948 --> 00:29:05,607
You took my photo
off the ofrenda?

560
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:06,806
It was an accident.

561
00:29:06,831 --> 00:29:08,108
How do we send him back?

562
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:10,362
Well, since it's a family matter...

563
00:29:10,386 --> 00:29:12,933
The way to undo a family curse is

564
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,759
to get your family's blessing.

565
00:29:14,784 --> 00:29:15,688
That's it?

566
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,030
Get your family's blessing

567
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,745
and everything should
go back to normal.

568
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,832
But you've gotta do it by sunrise.

569
00:29:21,857 --> 00:29:23,365
What happens at sunrise?

570
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,365
Híjole, your hand!

571
00:29:26,104 --> 00:29:27,064
Huh!

572
00:29:30,851 --> 00:29:33,518
Whoa, Miguel.
Can't have you fainting on us.

573
00:29:33,843 --> 00:29:35,295
But not to worry.

574
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,368
Your family is here.

575
00:29:36,393 --> 00:29:38,264
You can get your
blessing right now.

576
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:40,542
Cempasuchil, cempasuchil.

577
00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:41,733
Aha!

578
00:29:41,758 --> 00:29:43,035
Perdón, señora.

579
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,940
Oh.

580
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:46,806
Now, you look at the living
and say his name.

581
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:48,647
Miguel.

582
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,655
Nailed it.

583
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,162
Now say,
"I give you my blessing."

584
00:29:52,187 --> 00:29:54,028
I give you my blessing.

585
00:29:56,581 --> 00:29:59,747
I give you my blessing
to go home...

586
00:29:59,914 --> 00:30:03,398
To put my photo back
on the ofrenda...

587
00:30:03,445 --> 00:30:05,605
And to never play music again.

588
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,477
What? She can't do that!

589
00:30:07,502 --> 00:30:10,892
Well, technically, she can add
any condition she wants.

590
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:12,803
Fine.

591
00:30:12,828 --> 00:30:14,962
Then you
hand the petal to Miguel.

592
00:30:22,632 --> 00:30:23,624
Ha!

593
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:29,022
No skeletons.

594
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,185
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.

595
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,836
Two seconds and you
already break your promise.

596
00:30:41,861 --> 00:30:43,749
This isn't fair, it's my life.

597
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:45,417
You already had yours.

598
00:30:45,695 --> 00:30:47,734
Papá Julio,
I ask for your blessing.

599
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,695
Tía Rosita?

600
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,322
Oscar?

601
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:52,187
Felipe?

602
00:30:52,212 --> 00:30:53,393
Tía Victoria?

603
00:30:53,568 --> 00:30:55,195
Don't make this hard, mijo.

604
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:58,020
You go home my way,
or no way.

605
00:30:58,044 --> 00:30:59,727
You really hate music
that much?

606
00:30:59,752 --> 00:31:02,798
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.

607
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,615
The same path he did.

608
00:31:08,456 --> 00:31:09,845
He's family.

609
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,361
Listen to your Mamá Imelda.

610
00:31:11,386 --> 00:31:12,353
She's just looking out for you.

611
00:31:12,377 --> 00:31:13,893
Be reasonable.

612
00:31:13,918 --> 00:31:17,004
Con permiso,
I need to visit the rest room.

613
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:19,251
Be right back.

614
00:31:19,696 --> 00:31:21,228
Ah, should we tell him

615
00:31:21,253 --> 00:31:23,473
there are no restrooms
in the Land of the Dead?

616
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:37,553
Vámonos.

617
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,841
We got a family looking
for a living boy.

618
00:31:39,873 --> 00:31:42,904
I wanna be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.

619
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:44,865
We gotta find my
great-great-grandpa.

620
00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:45,992
Hold it, muchaco.

621
00:31:46,017 --> 00:31:46,937
Huh!

622
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:51,819
I found that little boy!

623
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,843
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me, folks.

624
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,557
Excuse me.

625
00:31:56,176 --> 00:31:57,192
Oh.

626
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:03,483
Dante.

627
00:32:03,636 --> 00:32:05,136
Disturbing the peace.

628
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,588
Fleeing an officer.

629
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:08,390
Falsifying a unibrow.

630
00:32:08,415 --> 00:32:09,526
That's illegal?

631
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:10,915
Very illegal.

632
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,170
You need to clean up
your act, amigo.

633
00:32:13,195 --> 00:32:14,202
Amigo?

634
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:17,083
Oh, that's-that's so nice
to hear you say that because

635
00:32:17,107 --> 00:32:20,202
I have just had a really
hard Día de Muertos

636
00:32:20,227 --> 00:32:22,264
and I could really use
an amigo right now.

637
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:25,247
And amigos, they help
their amigos.

638
00:32:25,272 --> 00:32:27,836
Listen, you get me across
that bridge tonight...

639
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:29,756
and I'll make it
worth your while.

640
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,050
You like de la Cruz?

641
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,329
He and I go way back.

642
00:32:32,503 --> 00:32:35,749
I can get you front row seats
to his sunrise spectacular show.

643
00:32:35,774 --> 00:32:38,146
I-I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.

644
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:39,797
You just gotta let me
cross that bridge.

645
00:32:39,822 --> 00:32:42,155
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.

646
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:44,179
But my shift's almost up and...

647
00:32:44,204 --> 00:32:46,139
I wanna visit my living family.

648
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:48,838
So I'm letting you off
with a warning.

649
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:51,790
Can I at least
get my costume back?

650
00:32:51,815 --> 00:32:53,306
Uh... no.

651
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,267
Ser maldito.

652
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,393
Hey.

653
00:32:59,663 --> 00:33:00,798
Hey!

654
00:33:00,877 --> 00:33:02,330
You really know de la Cruz?

655
00:33:02,386 --> 00:33:04,933
Who wants to... ah! Ay!
You're alive!

656
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,394
Yeah, I'm alive.

657
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,553
And I want to get back to
the Land of the Living...

658
00:33:08,577 --> 00:33:09,847
I need de la Cruz' blessing.

659
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:11,394
That's weirdly specific.

660
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:13,101
He's my great-great-grandfather.

661
00:33:13,126 --> 00:33:15,886
He's your gr-gr-gr-
what?

662
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:17,443
Ew.

663
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:19,737
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

664
00:33:19,777 --> 00:33:20,896
Wait, wait.

665
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,245
Hunh!

666
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,157
Wait. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait

667
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:24,816
Wait, uh, wait,

668
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:25,143
Wait, uh, wait, wait,

669
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:25,454
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait,

670
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:25,834
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait,

671
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:26,193
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

672
00:33:26,218 --> 00:33:26,502
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

673
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,040
Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!

674
00:33:29,065 --> 00:33:30,872
You know what? Maybe this
isn't such a good...

675
00:33:30,897 --> 00:33:32,819
Niño, niño, I can help you.

676
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,717
You can help me.
We can help each other.

677
00:33:34,742 --> 00:33:36,563
But most importantly,
you can help me.

678
00:33:36,587 --> 00:33:37,590
- Miguel!
- Huh!

679
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:39,583
- I'm Héctor.
- That's nice.

680
00:33:44,264 --> 00:33:46,034
Esperame, chamaco!

681
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:56,345
Ay! He is going
to get himself killed!

682
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,274
I need my spirit guide...

683
00:33:58,299 --> 00:33:59,567
Pepita.

684
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:13,809
Who has that petal
Miguel touched?

685
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:17,023
Here... n-nice alebrije.

686
00:34:29,549 --> 00:34:31,406
Hey, hey, hold still.

687
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:32,923
Look up, look up.
A ver, a ver.

688
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:34,471
Look up, up, up!

689
00:34:34,495 --> 00:34:36,948


690
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:41,535
Okay.

691
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,281
Eh. Ta-da!

692
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:45,844
Dead as a doorknob.

693
00:34:46,915 --> 00:34:50,058
So listen, Miguel.
This place runs on memories.

694
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,439
When you're well remembered,
people put up your photo...

695
00:34:52,463 --> 00:34:53,899
and you get to cross the bridge

696
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:56,153
and visit the living on
Día de Muertos.

697
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,376
Unless you're me.

698
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,733
You don't get to cross over?

699
00:34:58,758 --> 00:35:00,440
No one's ever put up my picture.

700
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,217
But you can change that!

701
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,916
This is you?

702
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:05,369
Eh, Muy guapo, eh?

703
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:08,629
So, you get me to my
great-great-grandpa...

704
00:35:08,654 --> 00:35:11,201
Then I put up your photo
when I get home?

705
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:12,678
Such a smart boy!

706
00:35:12,703 --> 00:35:14,519
Yes! Great idea, yes!

707
00:35:14,544 --> 00:35:17,274
One hiccup, de la Cruz
is a tough guy to get to...

708
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:19,989
and I need to cross that
bridge soon. Like tonight.

709
00:35:20,014 --> 00:35:21,831
So, you got any other
family here, you know?

710
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:24,260
Someone a bit more, eh,
accessible?

711
00:35:24,285 --> 00:35:25,634
Um... nope.

712
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:27,260
Don't yank my chain, chamaco.

713
00:35:27,285 --> 00:35:28,840
You gotta have
some other family.

714
00:35:28,864 --> 00:35:30,356
Only de la Cruz.

715
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:32,539
If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.

716
00:35:33,824 --> 00:35:36,015
Ugh. Okay, okay, kid.
Fine, fine.

717
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,888
I'll get you to your
great-great-grandpa.

718
00:35:39,624 --> 00:35:40,942
It's not gonna be easy,
you know.

719
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:42,665
You know, he's a-
he's a busy man.

720
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,378
Wait, what are you doing?

721
00:35:44,403 --> 00:35:46,869
I'm walking like a skeleton.
Blending in.

722
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,577
No. Skeletons don't
walk like that.

723
00:35:48,602 --> 00:35:49,665
It's how you walk.

724
00:35:49,721 --> 00:35:50,791
No, I don't.

725
00:35:51,356 --> 00:35:52,618
Stop it!

726
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:53,951
Whoa!

727
00:35:53,976 --> 00:35:56,881
Ernesto de la Cruz'
Sunrise Spectacular?

728
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:57,944
Que padre?

729
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:00,295
Wuacch, every year,
your great-great-grandpa

730
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,247
puts on that dumb show
to mark the end of Día de Muertos.

731
00:36:03,272 --> 00:36:04,796
A-a-and you can get us in!

732
00:36:04,821 --> 00:36:05,768
I'm...

733
00:36:05,816 --> 00:36:07,662
Hey, you said you had
front-row tickets!

734
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:08,535
That...

735
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,420
that was a lie.

736
00:36:09,445 --> 00:36:10,984
I apologize for that.

737
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,149
Cool off, chamaco, come on.
I'll get you to him.

738
00:36:13,181 --> 00:36:14,094
How?

739
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:16,523
'Cause I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.

740
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:29,933
Ugh.

741
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:34,576
You better have
my dress, Héctor.

742
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:36,052
Hola, Ceci!

743
00:36:37,307 --> 00:36:38,426
Ay!

744
00:36:41,957 --> 00:36:42,917
Hola.

745
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,040
Cezi!

746
00:36:45,065 --> 00:36:46,199
I lost the dress.

747
00:36:46,224 --> 00:36:47,730
Ay, diosa Mia!

748
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:49,986
I've got to dress 40 dancers
by sunrise.

749
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,381
- And thanks to you...
- Cezi, Cezi...

750
00:36:51,453 --> 00:36:52,540
- I'm one Frida short
- Cezi...

751
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:53,866
of an opening number.
- Dante.

752
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,517
Dante!

753
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:58,199
We shouldn't be in here.

754
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:15,353
Dante! Ven acá!

755
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:26,409
You!
How did you get in here?

756
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:27,521
I-I just followed my...

757
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:30,512
Hunh! Oh, the mighty Xolo dog!

758
00:37:30,537 --> 00:37:33,061
Guider of wandering spirits.

759
00:37:33,813 --> 00:37:36,393
And whose spirit
have you guided to me?

760
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:38,940
I don't think he's a spirit guide.

761
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,600
Uh-uh-uh! The alebrijes of this
world can take many forms.

762
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,592
They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.

763
00:37:51,491 --> 00:37:53,436
Or maybe he's just a dog.

764
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:55,618
Come! I need your eyes.

765
00:37:56,223 --> 00:37:58,246
Your are the audience.

766
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,611
Darkness!

767
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:02,813
And from the darkness...

768
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:05,115
A giant papaya!

769
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:08,583
Dancers emerge from the papaya.

770
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,323
And the dancers...

771
00:38:10,348 --> 00:38:11,903
Are all me!

772
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,871
And they go to drink
from the milk of their mother.

773
00:38:16,014 --> 00:38:18,823
Who is a cactus.
But who is also me!

774
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:21,196
And her milk is not milk...

775
00:38:21,268 --> 00:38:22,974
but tears.

776
00:38:24,078 --> 00:38:25,507
Is it too obvious?

777
00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:28,765
I think it's just the
right amount of obvious.

778
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:30,741
It could use some music.

779
00:38:30,773 --> 00:38:32,257
Oh, what if you did like...

780
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,836
Tun-tun-tun-tun-tun?

781
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:37,146
Oh, and then it could go...

782
00:38:37,217 --> 00:38:40,090
Darala-dalala-dalala-dalala
Whenk?

783
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,868
And what if everything was on fire?

784
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:47,582
Yes! Fire everywhere!

785
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:49,090
Inspired.

786
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,947
You. You have
the spirit of an artist.

787
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,878
The dancers exit. The music fades.
The lights go out.

788
00:38:56,981 --> 00:39:00,124
And Ernesto de la Cruz
rises to the stage.

789
00:39:04,057 --> 00:39:04,875
Huh?

790
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,844
He does a couple of songs.
The sun rises. Everyone cheers.

791
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:09,939
Excuse me, where's
the real de la Cruz?

792
00:39:10,003 --> 00:39:11,788
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals.

793
00:39:11,844 --> 00:39:15,979
He's too busy hosting that
fancy party at the top of his tower.

794
00:39:19,373 --> 00:39:21,674
Chamaco, you can't
run off on me like that.

795
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:23,492
Come on, stop pestering
the celebrities.

796
00:39:23,517 --> 00:39:25,699
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here.

797
00:39:25,771 --> 00:39:28,334
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.

798
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:31,184
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?

799
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,914
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?

800
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:37,178
He's your great-great-grandpa.
How come he didn't invite you?

801
00:39:37,203 --> 00:39:39,393
Hey, Gustavo! You know
anything about this party?

802
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,354
Sh-it's the hot ticket!

803
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,108
But if you're not on the guest list,
you're never gettin' in,

804
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,386
Chorizo.

805
00:39:45,411 --> 00:39:47,149
Hey, it's Chorizo!

806
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,950
Ah-ha, very funny, guys.
Very funny.

807
00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:51,205
Chorizo?

808
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,110
Oh, this guy's famous.

809
00:39:53,135 --> 00:39:55,277
Go on, go on.
Ask him how he died.

810
00:39:55,308 --> 00:39:56,943
I-I don't wanna talk about it.

811
00:39:56,968 --> 00:39:59,664
He choked on some chorizo!

812
00:40:02,355 --> 00:40:04,545
I didn't choke, okay?
I got food poisoning

813
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,974
which is a big difference.

814
00:40:06,847 --> 00:40:08,625
This is why I don't like musicians.

815
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,537
Bunch of self-important jerks!

816
00:40:10,562 --> 00:40:12,109
Hey, I'm a musician.

817
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:13,396
- You are?
- Well...

818
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:15,348
If you really wanna get to Ernesto...

819
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:18,460
there is that music competition
at the Plaza de la Cruz.

820
00:40:18,485 --> 00:40:21,294
Winner gets to play at his party.

821
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:24,803
No, no, no, Chamaco!
You are loco if you think...

822
00:40:24,828 --> 00:40:27,604
I need to get my great-great-
grandfather's blessing.

823
00:40:27,653 --> 00:40:29,859
You know where
I can get a guitar?

824
00:40:29,931 --> 00:40:33,113
Ay... I know a guy.

825
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,717
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?

826
00:40:49,185 --> 00:40:50,399
A footprint!

827
00:40:50,424 --> 00:40:51,924
It's a Rivera boot.

828
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,709
- Size seven!
- And a half.

829
00:40:53,774 --> 00:40:56,004
- Pronated.
- Miguel.

830
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,293
Why the heck would you
wanna be a musician?

831
00:41:07,325 --> 00:41:09,422
My great-great-grandfather's
a musician.

832
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:12,698
Who spent his life performing like
a monkey for complete strangers?

833
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:14,868
Blech! No, no, thank you, no.

834
00:41:14,914 --> 00:41:16,715
What do you know?

835
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:19,271
So, how far is this guitar, anyway?

836
00:41:19,296 --> 00:41:20,660
We're almost there.

837
00:41:25,212 --> 00:41:26,974
Keep up, chamaco, come on!

838
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:37,448
Cousin Héctor!

839
00:41:37,473 --> 00:41:39,099
Hey! These guys!

840
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:40,091
Héctor!

841
00:41:40,116 --> 00:41:41,520
Hey, tío, qué onda?

842
00:41:41,545 --> 00:41:43,194
These people are all you family?

843
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:45,052
Eh... yeah, in a way.

844
00:41:45,077 --> 00:41:47,926
We're all the ones with
no photos or ofrendas.

845
00:41:47,951 --> 00:41:49,609
No family to go home to.

846
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:50,975
Nearly forgotten, you know?

847
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,356
So we all call each other
"cousin" or "tío" or-or whatever.

848
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:02,707
- Héctor!
- Tía Chelos! Hey!

849
00:42:04,168 --> 00:42:06,056
Muchas gracias.

850
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:07,398
Save some for me.

851
00:42:07,423 --> 00:42:08,858
Is Chicharrón around?

852
00:42:08,883 --> 00:42:12,391
In the bungalow. I don't know if
he's in the mood for visitors.

853
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:15,843
Ah, who doesn't like a
visit from cousin Héctor?

854
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:19,709
Huh!

855
00:42:24,805 --> 00:42:26,495
Buenas noches, Chicharrón.

856
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,967
I don't want to see your
stupid face, Héctor.

857
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:31,340
Come on, its Día de Muertos.

858
00:42:31,365 --> 00:42:32,674
I brought you a little offering.

859
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:34,071
Get outta here!

860
00:42:34,096 --> 00:42:35,969
I would Chich, but the thing is...

861
00:42:35,994 --> 00:42:38,143
me and my friend Miguel...

862
00:42:38,168 --> 00:42:40,159
we really need to
borrow your guitar.

863
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:41,716
- My guitar?
- Yes.

864
00:42:41,741 --> 00:42:44,224
My prized, beloved guitar?

865
00:42:44,249 --> 00:42:45,907
I promise we'll bring it right back.

866
00:42:45,932 --> 00:42:48,201
Like the time you promised
to bring back my van?

867
00:42:48,226 --> 00:42:49,209
Eh...

868
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,654
- Or my mini fridge?
- Oh, you see...

869
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:53,947
Or my good napkins,
my lasso, my femur?!

870
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:55,091
No, not like those things.

871
00:42:55,116 --> 00:42:56,449
Where's my femur, you...

872
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:58,632
Oh, oh.

873
00:42:59,005 --> 00:43:00,235
You okay, amigo?

874
00:43:01,243 --> 00:43:02,909
I'm fading, Héctor.

875
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,249
I can feel it.

876
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:09,225
I couldn't even play that
thing if I wanted to.

877
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,531
You, play me something.

878
00:43:14,556 --> 00:43:17,190
Oh, you know I don't
play anymore, Chich.

879
00:43:17,215 --> 00:43:18,880
The guitar's for the kid.

880
00:43:18,905 --> 00:43:20,389
You want it?

881
00:43:20,414 --> 00:43:22,810
You've got to earn it.

882
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,016
Ay, only for you, amigo.

883
00:43:29,413 --> 00:43:30,905
Any requests?

884
00:43:32,397 --> 00:43:34,890
You know my favorite, Héctor.

885
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:56,367

886

Those aren't the words.

892
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:17,589

898
00:44:51,784 --> 00:44:53,490
Gracias.

899
00:45:24,701 --> 00:45:26,860
Wait, what happened?

900
00:45:27,043 --> 00:45:28,971
He's been forgotten.

901
00:45:29,153 --> 00:45:32,019
When there's no one left in the
living world who remembers you...

902
00:45:32,044 --> 00:45:34,367
you disappear from this world.

903
00:45:34,605 --> 00:45:37,780
We call it "The Final Death."

904
00:45:38,256 --> 00:45:40,153
W-where did he go?

905
00:45:40,178 --> 00:45:41,534
No one knows.

906
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:42,907
But I've met him.

907
00:45:42,932 --> 00:45:45,090
I could remember him...
when I go back.

908
00:45:45,115 --> 00:45:47,551
No, it doesn't work
like that, chamaco.

909
00:45:47,717 --> 00:45:49,448
Our memories...

910
00:45:49,473 --> 00:45:52,996
They have to be passed down
by those who knew us in life.

911
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,806
In the stories
they tell about us.

912
00:45:55,995 --> 00:45:59,313
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Chich's stories.

913
00:46:01,399 --> 00:46:03,376
Hey, it happens to
everyone eventually.

914
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:06,867
Come on, de la Cruzito,
you've got a contest to win.

915
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,720
You told me you hated musicians.

916
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:22,307
You never said you were one.

917
00:46:22,332 --> 00:46:24,483
How do you think I knew
your great-great-grandpa?

918
00:46:24,508 --> 00:46:25,967
We used to play music together.

919
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,515
Taught him everything he knows.

920
00:46:27,562 --> 00:46:28,912
No manches.

921
00:46:28,937 --> 00:46:31,078
You played with
Ernesto de la Cruz?

922
00:46:31,103 --> 00:46:32,792
The greatest musician
of all time?

923
00:46:32,817 --> 00:46:34,833
Oh! Oh, you're funny.

924
00:46:34,857 --> 00:46:36,857
Greatest eyebrows
of all time, maybe.

925
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:38,840
But his music, eh, not so much.

926
00:46:38,865 --> 00:46:41,015
You don't know what
you're talking about.

927
00:46:42,991 --> 00:46:46,316
Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz.

928
00:46:46,547 --> 00:46:48,499
Showtime, chamaco.

929
00:46:54,488 --> 00:46:57,004
Querer lo, t-shirts, bobbleheads.

930
00:47:03,678 --> 00:47:06,947
Bienvenidos a todos!

931
00:47:06,972 --> 00:47:09,527
Ow! ha-hah-ay!

932
00:47:09,552 --> 00:47:13,084
Who's ready for some música?

933
00:47:13,812 --> 00:47:16,495
It's a Battle of
the Bands, amigos.

934
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,534
The winner gets to play
for the maestro himself...

935
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,963
Ernesto de la Cruz
on his fiesta tonight!

936
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:26,093
That's our ticket, muchacho.

937
00:47:27,864 --> 00:47:32,118
Let the competition begin!

938
00:47:47,213 --> 00:47:49,229
So, what's the plan?
W-what are you gonna play?

939
00:47:49,254 --> 00:47:51,142
Definitely "Remember Me."

940
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:52,610
No, not that one. No.

941
00:47:52,635 --> 00:47:54,158
Come on, it's the
most popular song.

942
00:47:54,183 --> 00:47:55,277
Ah, it's too popular.

943
00:47:55,302 --> 00:47:57,556
♪ Remember me
though I have to travel far ♪

944
00:47:57,581 --> 00:47:58,692
♪ Remember... ♪

945
00:47:58,723 --> 00:48:01,112
♪ Don't let it make you cry ♪

946
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:07,016
Um, what about...
Poco Loco?

947
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,040
Epa! Now, that's a song.

948
00:48:09,064 --> 00:48:10,810
De la Cruzito!
You're on standby.

949
00:48:10,834 --> 00:48:13,087
Los Chachalacos,
you're up next.

950
00:48:14,056 --> 00:48:16,429
Los Chachalacos!

951
00:48:27,311 --> 00:48:29,073
You always this nervous
before a performance?

952
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:32,360
I don't know.
I've never performed before.

953
00:48:32,391 --> 00:48:34,264
What? You said
you were a musician!

954
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:36,486
I am! I mean, I-I will be.

955
00:48:36,511 --> 00:48:37,764
- Ay!
- Once I win.

956
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,035
That's your plan?

957
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,860
No, no, no, no.
You have to win, Miguel.

958
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:42,607
Your life literally
depends on you winning.

959
00:48:42,632 --> 00:48:44,084
And you've never
done this before?

960
00:48:44,109 --> 00:48:45,543
- I'll go up.
- Uh, n-no!

961
00:48:45,568 --> 00:48:47,164
- I need to do this.
- Why?

962
00:48:47,307 --> 00:48:49,458
If I can't go out there
and play one song...

963
00:48:49,483 --> 00:48:51,251
how can I call myself
a musician?

964
00:48:51,276 --> 00:48:52,323
What does that matter?

965
00:48:52,348 --> 00:48:55,157
'Cause I don't just want
to get de la Cruz' blessing.

966
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,086
I need to prove that...

967
00:48:57,158 --> 00:48:59,276
that I'm worthy of it.

968
00:48:59,301 --> 00:49:01,982
Oh. Oh, that's such
a sweet sentiment.

969
00:49:02,007 --> 00:49:04,476
At such a bad time!

970
00:49:05,973 --> 00:49:08,028
Okay! Okay, okay. Okay.

971
00:49:08,076 --> 00:49:11,107
Okay, you wanna perform?
Then you've got to perform!

972
00:49:11,132 --> 00:49:12,504
First, you have to loosen up.

973
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:13,893
Shake off those nerves.

974
00:49:17,937 --> 00:49:19,509
Now, give me your best grito.

975
00:49:19,534 --> 00:49:20,858
My best grito?

976
00:49:20,883 --> 00:49:22,405
Come on, yell. Belt it out.

977
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:25,208
Haooeyy-he-he-hey!

978
00:49:25,994 --> 00:49:27,525
Oh, it feels good.

979
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,367
Okay, now, now, now you.

980
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:31,264
A-a-eh.

981
00:49:31,289 --> 00:49:32,527
Aeh...

982
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,291
Ay...

983
00:49:33,316 --> 00:49:34,042
Ay...ay...

984
00:49:34,067 --> 00:49:34,764
Ay...ay...ay.

985
00:49:34,789 --> 00:49:36,242
Oh, come on, kid.

986
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:48,520
De la Cruzito!
You're on now!

987
00:49:48,545 --> 00:49:50,886
Miguel, look at me.
Hey, hey, look at me.

988
00:49:50,911 --> 00:49:51,798
Come on, let's go!

989
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:52,689
You can do this.

990
00:49:52,714 --> 00:49:54,697
Grab their attention
and don't let it go!

991
00:49:54,722 --> 00:49:55,388
Héctor...

992
00:49:55,413 --> 00:49:56,968
Make them listen, chamaco.
You've got this.

993
00:49:57,047 --> 00:49:59,293
De la Cruzito!

994
00:49:59,317 --> 00:50:02,103
Arriba-Ba! Hey!

995
00:50:05,805 --> 00:50:07,352
Eh...

996
00:50:08,146 --> 00:50:10,400
What's he doing?
Why isn't he playing?

997
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:12,987
Bring back the singing dog!

998
00:50:13,932 --> 00:50:14,964
Hunh!

I'm proud of you.

Hey, where are you going?

00:52:33,243 --> 00:52:35,393
I have a emergency announcement.

1041
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:38,648
Please be on the look out
for a living boy.

1042
00:52:38,673 --> 00:52:40,792
Answers to the name of Miguel.

1043
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,777
Earlier tonight, he ran away
from his family.

1044
00:52:43,802 --> 00:52:47,214
They just want to send him
back to the Land of the Living.

1045
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:48,580
Wait, wait, wait.

1046
00:52:48,605 --> 00:52:50,380
You said de la Cruz
was your only family.

1047
00:52:50,405 --> 00:52:52,031
The only person who
could send you home.

1048
00:52:52,056 --> 00:52:53,277
I do have other family, but...

1049
00:52:53,302 --> 00:52:55,336
You could have taken my
photo back this whole time?

1050
00:52:55,361 --> 00:52:58,349
But they hate music.
I need a musician's blessing.

1051
00:52:58,374 --> 00:53:01,119
- You lied to me!
- Oh, you're one to talk.

1052
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:03,112
Look at me, I'm being
forgotten, Miguel.

1053
00:53:03,137 --> 00:53:04,898
I don't even know if I'm
gonna last the night.

1054
00:53:04,923 --> 00:53:07,462
I'm not gonna miss my one
chance to cross that bridge

1055
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:10,526
'cause you want to live out
some stupid musical fantasy.

1056
00:53:10,551 --> 00:53:12,610
- It's not stupid.
- I'm taking you to your family.

1057
00:53:12,635 --> 00:53:14,654
- Let go of me.
- You'll thank me later.

1058
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:17,019
You don't wanna help me.
You only care about yourself.

1059
00:53:17,584 --> 00:53:19,512
Keep your dumb photo.
- No!

1060
00:53:19,537 --> 00:53:21,131
No, no, no!
- Stay away from me!

1061
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:21,838
No!

1062
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,012
Hey, chamaco?

1063
00:53:25,232 --> 00:53:26,589
Where did you go?

1064
00:53:27,382 --> 00:53:28,343
Chamaco?

1065
00:53:29,064 --> 00:53:30,073
Sorry!

1066
00:53:30,263 --> 00:53:31,263
Come back.

1067
00:53:40,836 --> 00:53:42,487
Dante, cállate.

1068
00:53:43,455 --> 00:53:45,265
Don't Dante, stop it.

1069
00:53:45,297 --> 00:53:46,924
He can't help me.

1070
00:53:48,236 --> 00:53:49,959
Dante, stop.

1071
00:53:50,188 --> 00:53:51,522
Stop it.

1072
00:53:51,617 --> 00:53:52,784
Leave me alone!

1073
00:53:52,809 --> 00:53:55,442
You're not a spirit guide,
you're just a dumb dog.

1074
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:57,063
Now get outta here!

1075
00:53:57,213 --> 00:53:58,451
It's him!

1076
00:53:58,491 --> 00:53:59,800
It's that living boy!

1077
00:53:59,825 --> 00:54:01,014
I've heard about him, look!

1078
00:54:01,055 --> 00:54:02,157
He's alive.

1079
00:54:10,952 --> 00:54:12,023
Huah!

1080
00:54:12,229 --> 00:54:13,403
Aah!

1081
00:54:13,428 --> 00:54:15,888
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!

1082
00:54:15,912 --> 00:54:18,476
I am giving you my blessing,
and you are going home.

1083
00:54:18,501 --> 00:54:20,293
I don't want your blessing.

1084
00:54:21,112 --> 00:54:22,572
Miguel! Stop!

1085
00:54:25,247 --> 00:54:26,485
Come back!

1086
00:54:28,604 --> 00:54:29,620
Miguel!

1087
00:54:33,694 --> 00:54:36,019
I am trying to save your life.

1088
00:54:36,044 --> 00:54:37,496
You're ruining my life.

1089

1090
00:54:38,489 --> 00:54:40,370
Music's the only thing
that makes me happy.

1091
00:54:40,395 --> 00:54:43,283
A-and you... you wanna
take that away.

1092
00:54:43,536 --> 00:54:44,909

Oh, I loved it.

1097
00:55:03,361 --> 00:55:05,797
I remember that feeling.

1098
00:55:05,822 --> 00:55:09,393
When my husband would play,
and I would sing.

1099
00:55:09,418 --> 00:55:12,115
And nothing else mattered.

1100
00:55:13,024 --> 00:55:15,166
But when we had Coco...

1101
00:55:15,191 --> 00:55:20,349
suddenly, there was something in my
life that mattered more than music.

1102
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,109
I wanted to put down rules.

1103
00:55:24,471 --> 00:55:26,932
He wanted to play for the world.

1104
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:31,765
We each made a sacrifice
to get what we wanted.

That's what family's

1109
00:55:41,864 --> 00:55:43,571
Support you.

1110

1158
00:59:39,544 --> 00:59:40,551
Ah!

1159
00:59:41,693 --> 00:59:42,685
Hunh!

1160
00:59:52,074 --> 00:59:53,852
Are you all right, niño?

1161
00:59:55,963 --> 00:59:57,233
Huah!

1162
00:59:57,518 --> 00:59:59,200
It-it's you.

1163
00:59:59,264 --> 01:00:00,772
Y-you are that boy.

1164
01:00:00,812 --> 01:00:02,780
The one who came from
the Land of the Living.

1165
01:00:02,805 --> 01:00:05,146
You... know about me?

1166
01:00:05,171 --> 01:00:07,646
You're all anyone
has been talking about.

1167
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,044
Why have you come here?

1168
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:11,615
I'm Miguel.

1169
01:00:12,251 --> 01:00:15,267
Your g-great-great-grandson.

1170
01:00:15,704 --> 01:00:18,259
I have a great-great-grandson?

1171
01:00:18,284 --> 01:00:19,466
I need your blessing.

1172
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:23,361
So I can go back home and
be a musician just like you.

1173
01:00:23,906 --> 01:00:25,794
The rest of our family...

1174
01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:27,889
they wouldn't listen.

1175
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:30,920
But I... I hoped you would.

1176
01:00:32,745 --> 01:00:35,594
My boy, with a talent like yours...

1177
01:00:35,904 --> 01:00:37,801
how could I not listen?

1178
01:00:39,571 --> 01:00:42,952
Haha! I have a
great-great-grandson!

1179
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:50,898
Look, it's Frida!

1180
01:00:50,923 --> 01:00:53,024
Yes, it is I, Frida Kahlo.

1181
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:54,715
It is an honor, señora.

1182
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,208
Gracias.

1183
01:01:00,167 --> 01:01:01,691
Hey, Negrete, Infante.

1184
01:01:01,716 --> 01:01:03,954
Have you met my
great-great-grandson?

1185
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:06,192
My great-great-grandson!

1186
01:01:06,217 --> 01:01:08,604
He is alive and a musician, to boot.

1187
01:01:08,629 --> 01:01:10,732
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.

1188
01:01:10,757 --> 01:01:11,938
No dimple!

1189
01:01:11,962 --> 01:01:13,525
To our friendship. Haha!

1190
01:01:13,526 --> 01:01:17,668
I'd move heaven and earth
for you, mi amigo. Salud!

1191
01:01:18,414 --> 01:01:19,883
Poison!

1192
01:01:20,557 --> 01:01:22,479
You know, I did all my own stunts.

1193
01:01:22,504 --> 01:01:26,121
♪ Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me ♪

1194
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:32,348
All of this came from my amazing
fans in the Land of the Living.

1195
01:01:33,474 --> 01:01:36,260
They leave me more offerings
than I know what to do with.

1196
01:01:37,482 --> 01:01:38,705
Hey, what's wrong?

1197
01:01:38,808 --> 01:01:40,705
Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed.

1198
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,078
N-no, It's all great.

1199
01:01:43,103 --> 01:01:45,419
- But?
- It's just...

1200
01:01:45,593 --> 01:01:48,640
I've been looking up
to you my whole life.

1201
01:01:48,759 --> 01:01:51,331
You're the guy
who actually did it.

1202
01:01:52,786 --> 01:01:55,310
But did you ever regret it?

1203
01:01:55,342 --> 01:01:59,016
Choosing music
over everything else?

1204
01:01:59,468 --> 01:02:03,928
It was hard saying
goodbye to my hometown.

1205
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:05,810
Heading off on my own.

1206
01:02:05,935 --> 01:02:08,109
Leaving your family?

1207
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:09,696
Si.

1208
01:02:09,863 --> 01:02:12,871
But I could not have
done it differently.

1209
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:16,083
One cannot deny
who one is meant to be.

1210
01:02:16,425 --> 01:02:18,766
And you, my great-great-grandson...

1211
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:21,210
are meant to be a musician.

1212
01:02:23,142 --> 01:02:25,936
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.

1213
01:02:25,961 --> 01:02:28,134
We cannot belong to one family.

1214
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:30,610
The world is our family!

1215
01:02:31,836 --> 01:02:34,463
Ooh-hoo! Ooh!
The fireworks have begun!

1216
01:02:45,072 --> 01:02:49,001
Soon, the party will move across
town for my sunrise spectacular.

1217
01:02:49,477 --> 01:02:52,239
Hunh! Miguel, you must
come to the show!

1218
01:02:52,453 --> 01:02:54,421
You will be my guest of honor.

1219
01:02:54,446 --> 01:02:57,096
- You mean it?
- Of course, my boy.

1220
01:02:59,153 --> 01:03:00,741
I can't.

1221
01:03:00,766 --> 01:03:03,257
I have to get home
<i>before</i> sunrise.

1222
01:03:03,282 --> 01:03:05,868
Oy! I really do need to get you home.

1223
01:03:09,721 --> 01:03:12,126
It has been an honor.

1224
01:03:12,253 --> 01:03:14,721
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.

1225
01:03:14,785 --> 01:03:16,896
I hope you die very soon.

1226
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:20,960
You know what I mean.

1227
01:03:22,759 --> 01:03:24,315
Miguel...

1228
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:26,171
I give you my blessing.

1229
01:03:26,196 --> 01:03:28,140
We had a deal, chamaco.

1230
01:03:28,165 --> 01:03:30,704
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?

1231
01:03:31,609 --> 01:03:34,483
Oh, Frida. I thought
you couldn't make it.

1232
01:03:34,618 --> 01:03:36,411
You said you'd take back my photo.

1233
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:38,085
You promised, Miguel.

1234
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,799
You know this uh, man?

1235
01:03:39,927 --> 01:03:41,522
I just met him tonight.

1236
01:03:41,547 --> 01:03:43,559
He told me he knew you.

1237
01:03:44,019 --> 01:03:45,956
H...Héctor?

1238
01:03:45,981 --> 01:03:47,361
Please, Miguel.

1239
01:03:47,386 --> 01:03:49,035
Put my photo up.

1240
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:55,242
My friend. You're...
you're being forgotten.

1241
01:03:55,267 --> 01:03:56,330
And whose fault is that?

1242
01:03:56,355 --> 01:03:58,370
- Héctor, please.
- Those were my songs you took.

1243
01:03:58,395 --> 01:04:00,021
My songs that made you famous.

1244
01:04:00,046 --> 01:04:01,966
- What?
- If I'm being forgotten...

1245
01:04:01,991 --> 01:04:03,990
It's because you never told anyone
that I wrote them.

1246
01:04:04,015 --> 01:04:07,332
That's crazy. De la Cruz
wrote all his own songs.

1247
01:04:07,357 --> 01:04:09,007
You wanna tell him?
Or should I?

1248
01:04:09,032 --> 01:04:11,618
Héctor, I never meant to take credit.

1249
01:04:11,642 --> 01:04:14,030
We made a great team, but...

1250
01:04:14,054 --> 01:04:18,118
you died, and... I-I only sang
your songs because

1251
01:04:18,143 --> 01:04:20,419
I wanted to keep
a part of you alive.

1252
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:22,143
Oh, how generous!

1253
01:04:22,168 --> 01:04:24,167
You really did play together.

1254
01:04:24,231 --> 01:04:26,802
Look, I don't want to fight about it.

1255
01:04:26,827 --> 01:04:28,715
I just want you to make it right.

1256
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,739
Miguel can put my photo up.

1257
01:04:30,764 --> 01:04:32,977
- Héctor.
- And I can cross over the bridge.

1258
01:04:33,104 --> 01:04:34,739
I could see my girl.

1259
01:04:34,953 --> 01:04:36,350
Ernesto.

1260
01:04:36,763 --> 01:04:38,223
Remember the night I left?

1261
01:04:38,248 --> 01:04:39,644
That was a long time ago.

1262
01:04:39,669 --> 01:04:40,946
We drank together.

1263
01:04:40,971 --> 01:04:44,058
And you told me you would move
heaven and earth for your amigo.

1264
01:04:44,296 --> 01:04:46,931
Well, I'm asking you to now.

1265
01:04:46,956 --> 01:04:48,728
Heaven and earth?

1266
01:04:48,753 --> 01:04:49,947
Like in the movie?

1267
01:04:49,972 --> 01:04:50,749
What?

1268
01:04:50,774 --> 01:04:52,427
That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

1269
01:04:52,452 --> 01:04:54,690
In the de la Cruz movie,
"El Camino a Casa."

1270
01:04:54,715 --> 01:04:56,356
I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.

1271
01:04:56,381 --> 01:04:58,326
No, it's in there.

1272
01:04:58,373 --> 01:04:59,477
Look!

1273
01:04:59,913 --> 01:05:02,104
<i>This calls for a toast.</i>

1274
01:05:02,129 --> 01:05:03,756
<i>To our friendship! Haha!</i>

1275
01:05:03,781 --> 01:05:06,343
<i>I would move heaven
and earth for you, mi amigo.</i>

1276
01:05:06,368 --> 01:05:09,258
But in the movie, Don Hidalgo
poisons the drink.

1277
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:11,043
<i>Salud.</i>

1278
01:05:11,068 --> 01:05:12,781
<i>Poison!</i>

1279
01:05:14,558 --> 01:05:16,558
That night, Ernesto.

1280
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:18,677
The night I left.

1281
01:05:18,772 --> 01:05:21,288
<i>We've been performing
on the road for months.</i>

1282
01:05:21,312 --> 01:05:24,502
<i>I got homesick
and I packed up my songs.</i>

1283
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,598
You wanna give up now?

1284
01:05:26,717 --> 01:05:28,766
When we're this close
to reaching our dream?

1285
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:30,789
This was your dream.
You'll manage.

1286
01:05:30,814 --> 01:05:32,950
I can't do this
without your songs, Héctor.

1287
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:34,528
I'm going home, Ernesto.

1288
01:05:34,553 --> 01:05:36,935
Hate me if you want.
But my mind is made up.

1289
01:05:39,919 --> 01:05:42,236
Oh, I could never hate you.

1290
01:05:42,261 --> 01:05:46,673
If you must go, then I'm...
I'm sending you off with a toast.

1291
01:05:49,631 --> 01:05:51,115
To our friendship.

1292
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:54,235
I would move heaven
and earth for you, mi amigo.

1293
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,767
Salud!

1294
01:06:00,244 --> 01:06:02,109
<i>You walked me to the train station.</i>

1295
01:06:02,149 --> 01:06:04,641
<i>But I felt a pain in my stomach.</i>

1296
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:06,831
<i>I thought it must have
been something I ate.</i>

1297
01:06:06,856 --> 01:06:08,912
<i>Perhaps it was that chorizo,
my friend.</i>

1298
01:06:08,937 --> 01:06:11,698
<i>Or something I drank.</i>

1299
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:17,011
I woke up dead.

1300
01:06:18,344 --> 01:06:19,741
You...

1301
01:06:19,766 --> 01:06:21,352
poisoned me!

1302
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:24,285
You're confusing movies
with reality, Héctor.

1303
01:06:24,468 --> 01:06:28,301
All this time, I thought
it was just bad luck.

1304
01:06:28,666 --> 01:06:31,992
I never thought that you might have...

1305
01:06:32,017 --> 01:06:33,740
that you...

1306
01:06:36,724 --> 01:06:38,244
How could you?

1307
01:06:38,269 --> 01:06:39,026
Héctor!

1308
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:40,182
Security! Security!

1309
01:06:40,568 --> 01:06:43,198
You took everything away from me!

1310
01:06:44,128 --> 01:06:45,353
You rat!

1311
01:06:46,021 --> 01:06:47,665
Have him taken care of.

1312
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:49,570
He's not well.

1313
01:06:49,595 --> 01:06:51,173
I just wanted to move back home!

1314
01:06:51,198 --> 01:06:53,781
No! No!

1315
01:06:55,402 --> 01:06:56,740
I apologize.

1316
01:06:57,358 --> 01:06:58,937
Where were we?

1317
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:01,157
You were going
to give me your blessing.

1318
01:07:01,182 --> 01:07:03,561
Yes... ah... Si.

1319
01:07:06,225 --> 01:07:07,858
Miguel...

1320
01:07:07,883 --> 01:07:11,237
My reputation... it is...

1321
01:07:11,262 --> 01:07:13,846
very important to me.

1322
01:07:13,871 --> 01:07:16,123
I would hate to have you think...

1323
01:07:16,148 --> 01:07:20,227
That you m-murdered Héctor
for his songs?

1324
01:07:21,361 --> 01:07:23,300
You don't think that.

1325
01:07:23,561 --> 01:07:24,703
Do you?

1326
01:07:24,806 --> 01:07:29,576
I... No... Everyone knows you're the...
the good guy.

1327
01:07:35,537 --> 01:07:39,466
Papá Ernesto...
my blessing?

1328
01:07:40,555 --> 01:07:42,357
Security?

1329
01:07:42,538 --> 01:07:45,576
Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

1330
01:07:45,601 --> 01:07:46,983
What?

1331
01:07:47,003 --> 01:07:48,579
But I'm your family!

1332
01:07:48,604 --> 01:07:50,688
And Héctor was my best friend.

1333
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,234
Success doesn't come
for free, Miguel.

1334
01:07:54,368 --> 01:07:57,871
You have to be willing
to do whatever it takes to...

1335
01:07:57,896 --> 01:08:00,363
seize your moment.

1336
01:08:00,387 --> 01:08:02,562
I know you understand.

1337
01:08:02,586 --> 01:08:04,586
No! No!

1338
01:08:06,572 --> 01:08:08,012
Let go!

1339
01:08:08,421 --> 01:08:09,589
No!

1340
01:08:09,813 --> 01:08:11,275
Aah!

1341
01:08:31,718 --> 01:08:33,158
Help!

1342
01:08:33,636 --> 01:08:35,394
Can anyone hear me?

1343
01:08:36,188 --> 01:08:38,172
I wanna go home!

1344
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:55,493
Huh?

1345
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:58,247
H-Héctor?

1346
01:08:58,272 --> 01:09:00,345
- Kid?
- Oh, Héctor!

1347
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,341
You were right.

1348
01:09:02,366 --> 01:09:04,246
I should have gone
back to my family.

1349
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:07,360
- Hey, hey, hey.
- They told me not to be like de la Cruz.

1350
01:09:07,428 --> 01:09:09,489
- But I didn't listen.
- Hey, it's okay.

1351
01:09:09,513 --> 01:09:11,859
But I told them I didn't care
if they remembered me.

1352
01:09:11,884 --> 01:09:14,932
I didn't care if was on
the stupid ofrenda.

1353
01:09:15,034 --> 01:09:17,256
Hey, chamaco, it's okay.

1354
01:09:17,281 --> 01:09:18,501
It's okay.

1355
01:09:18,526 --> 01:09:20,927
I told them I didn't care.

1356
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,644
- Huh! Oh!
- Héctor!

1357
01:09:25,669 --> 01:09:27,480
Héctor?

1358
01:09:28,105 --> 01:09:29,962
She's...

1359
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,927
forgetting me.

1360
01:09:31,952 --> 01:09:33,262
Who?

1361
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,280
My daughter.

1362
01:09:37,115 --> 01:09:41,342
She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.

1363
01:09:41,841 --> 01:09:44,120
I just wanted to see her again.

1364
01:09:45,444 --> 01:09:47,712
I never should have left Santa Cecilia.

1365
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,932
I wish I could apologize.

1366
01:09:50,956 --> 01:09:54,584
I wish I could tell her that her
Papá was trying to come home.

1367
01:09:54,865 --> 01:09:57,553
That he loved her so much.

1368
01:09:59,761 --> 01:10:01,405
My Coco.

1369
01:10:04,081 --> 01:10:05,351
Coco?

1370
01:10:20,495 --> 01:10:21,788
Where?

1371
01:10:22,026 --> 01:10:24,203
Where did you get this?

1372
01:10:24,384 --> 01:10:26,731
That's my Mamá Coco.

1373
01:10:26,756 --> 01:10:28,815
That's my Mamá Imelda.

1374
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,813
Is that...

1375
01:10:31,731 --> 01:10:32,921
You?

1376
01:10:36,402 --> 01:10:37,514
We're...

1377
01:10:38,486 --> 01:10:39,915
- family?
- Family?

1378
01:10:52,346 --> 01:10:55,169
I always hoped I'd see her again.

1379
01:10:55,294 --> 01:10:57,006
That she'd miss me.

1380
01:10:57,085 --> 01:10:58,911
Maybe put up my photo.

1381
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:01,267
But it never happened.

1382
01:11:02,389 --> 01:11:03,886
You know the worst part?

1383
01:11:04,192 --> 01:11:07,151
Even if I never got to see
Coco in the living world...

1384
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:09,983
I thought at least one day,
I'd see her here.

1385
01:11:10,142 --> 01:11:12,625
Give her the biggest hug.

1386
01:11:14,144 --> 01:11:16,809
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

1387
01:11:17,634 --> 01:11:19,856
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

1388
01:11:20,038 --> 01:11:21,852
You disappear.

1389
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:23,620
From this one.

1390
01:11:24,278 --> 01:11:25,953
You'll never get to see her.

1391
01:11:25,978 --> 01:11:27,640
Ever again.

1392
01:11:30,865 --> 01:11:31,988
You know...

1393
01:11:32,013 --> 01:11:33,904
I wrote her a song once.

1394
01:11:33,929 --> 01:11:36,309
We used to sing it every night.

1395
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:37,818
At the same time.

1396
01:11:37,942 --> 01:11:40,641
No matter how far apart we were.

1397
01:11:41,752 --> 01:11:44,346
What I wouldn't give
to sing it to her.

1398
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:45,355
One...

1399
01:11:45,412 --> 01:11:46,376
last...

1400
01:11:46,466 --> 01:11:47,725

H-He stole your guitar.

1420
01:12:56,153 --> 01:12:58,078
He stole your songs.

1421
01:12:58,235 --> 01:13:00,729
You should be the one
the world remembers.

1422
01:13:00,754 --> 01:13:01,974
Not de la Cruz.

1423
01:13:01,999 --> 01:13:04,423
I didn't write "Remember Me"
for the world.

1424
01:13:04,616 --> 01:13:06,589
I wrote it for Coco.

1425
01:13:08,219 --> 01:13:10,929
I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a
great-great-grandpa.

1426
01:13:10,954 --> 01:13:14,398
Are you kidding? A minute ago,
I thought I was related to a murderer.

1427
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:16,496
You're a total upgrade.

1428
01:13:16,838 --> 01:13:18,582
My whole life...

1429
01:13:18,607 --> 01:13:21,012
there's been something
that made me different.

1430
01:13:21,065 --> 01:13:23,435
And I never knew
where it came from.

1431
01:13:24,022 --> 01:13:25,349
But now, I know.

1432
01:13:25,374 --> 01:13:27,095
It comes from you!

1433
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:29,521
I'm proud we're family.

1434
01:13:30,417 --> 01:13:32,854
I'm proud to be his family!

1435
01:13:32,879 --> 01:13:36,012
Rrrr-aayy!

1436
01:13:36,346 --> 01:13:37,885
Haaa-ooei!

1437
01:13:37,936 --> 01:13:39,993
Aaah-haha-ha-aayy!

1438
01:13:40,018 --> 01:13:42,664
I'm proud to be
<i>his</i> family!

1439
01:13:42,689 --> 01:13:45,040
Haooo-whoo-hoo!

1440
01:13:45,065 --> 01:13:48,723
Ho-ha-ay!

1441
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,870
Dante?

1442
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:01,988
Dante!

1443
01:14:04,901 --> 01:14:06,330
It's Dante!

1444
01:14:11,418 --> 01:14:12,608
Haha!

1445
01:14:17,325 --> 01:14:18,889
Imelda!

1446
01:14:19,261 --> 01:14:20,883
Héctor.

1447
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,685
You look good.

1448
01:14:33,778 --> 01:14:35,037
Dante!

1449
01:14:35,062 --> 01:14:37,655
You knew he was my
Papá Héctor the whole time!

1450
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,242
You are a real spirit guide.

1451
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:42,245
Who's a good spirit guide?
You are!

1452
01:14:53,177 --> 01:14:54,356
Whoa!

1453
01:14:56,647 --> 01:14:57,724
Haha!

1454
01:15:01,656 --> 01:15:02,903
Dante!

1455
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:28,217
There they are!

1456
01:15:28,242 --> 01:15:30,131
Miguelito! Miguelito!

1457
01:15:34,677 --> 01:15:36,457
Gracias, Dios mio!

1458
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:52,985
Mijo, I was so worried.

1459
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:55,346
Thank goodness
we found you in time.

1460
01:15:56,092 --> 01:15:57,622
And you.

1461
01:15:57,647 --> 01:16:00,060
How many times
must I turn you away?

1462
01:16:00,085 --> 01:16:01,091
Imelda...

1463
01:16:01,116 --> 01:16:04,606
I want nothing to do with you.
Not in life, not in death.

1464
01:16:04,631 --> 01:16:08,348
I spent decades protecting
my family from your mistakes.

1465
01:16:08,373 --> 01:16:11,715
He spends five minutes with you,
and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!

1466
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:13,461
I wasn't in there 'cause of Héctor.

1467
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:15,468
He was in there 'cause of me.

1468
01:16:15,493 --> 01:16:18,144
He was just trying to get me home.

1469
01:16:18,169 --> 01:16:19,980
I didn't wanna listen.

1470
01:16:20,005 --> 01:16:21,919
But he was right.

1471
01:16:22,066 --> 01:16:24,640
Nothing is more
important than family.

1472
01:16:26,066 --> 01:16:28,629
I'm ready to accept your blessing.

1473
01:16:28,654 --> 01:16:30,749
And your conditions.

1474
01:16:30,774 --> 01:16:33,425
But first, I need to find de la Cruz.

1475
01:16:33,449 --> 01:16:34,785
To get Héctor's photo.

1476
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:36,780
- What?
- So he can see Coco again.

1477
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:38,651
Héctor should be on our ofrenda.

1478
01:16:38,676 --> 01:16:40,215
He's part of our family.

1479
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:41,735
He left this family.

1480
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,413
He tried to go home to you and Coco.

1481
01:16:43,438 --> 01:16:45,465
But de la Cruz murdered him.

1482
01:16:46,338 --> 01:16:48,118
It's true, Imelda.

1483
01:16:48,567 --> 01:16:50,324
And so what if it's true?

1484
01:16:50,349 --> 01:16:52,660
You leave me alone
with a child to raise,

1485
01:16:52,685 --> 01:16:54,620
and I'm just supposed
to forgive you?

1486
01:16:54,724 --> 01:16:56,005
Imelda, I...

1487
01:16:56,569 --> 01:16:58,021
Héctor?

1488
01:16:58,055 --> 01:16:59,177
Hunh!

1489
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:02,692
I'm running out of time.

1490
01:17:03,451 --> 01:17:04,857
It's Coco.

1491
01:17:05,445 --> 01:17:07,179
She's forgetting you.

1492
01:17:08,211 --> 01:17:10,456
You don't have to forgive him.

1493
01:17:10,637 --> 01:17:13,551
But we shouldn't forget him.

1494
01:17:15,954 --> 01:17:18,529
I wanted to forget you.

1495
01:17:19,084 --> 01:17:21,125
I wanted Coco
to forget you too, but...

1496
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:23,540
This is my fault.

1497
01:17:23,767 --> 01:17:25,569
Not yours.

1498
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:28,880
I'm sorry, Imelda.

1499
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:34,637
Miguel...

1500
01:17:34,728 --> 01:17:37,098
If we help you get his photo...

1501
01:17:37,141 --> 01:17:38,703
you will return home.

1502
01:17:38,728 --> 01:17:40,283
No more music.

1503
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:43,817
Family comes first.

1504
01:17:45,767 --> 01:17:49,055
I... I can't forgive you.

1505
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:53,100
But I will help you.

1506
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:56,887
So how do we get to
de la Cruz?

1507
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:00,936
I might know a way.

1508
01:18:51,079 --> 01:18:52,428
Good luck, muchacho.

1509
01:18:52,453 --> 01:18:53,766
Gracias, Frida.

1510
01:18:58,471 --> 01:18:59,537
Ah!

1511
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:03,062
Here, let me help you with...

1512
01:19:03,087 --> 01:19:04,255
Don't touch me.

1513
01:19:05,148 --> 01:19:06,375
Everyone clear on the plan?

1514
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,745
Find Héctor's photo.

1515
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:08,686
Give it to Miguel.

1516
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:09,718
Send Miguel home.

1517
01:19:09,743 --> 01:19:10,908
Got your petals?

1518
01:19:12,019 --> 01:19:14,117
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz.

1519
01:19:14,142 --> 01:19:15,432
- Yes?
- Ah!

1520
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:18,290
Don't I know you?

1521
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,499
That's for murdering
the love of my life!

1522
01:19:21,524 --> 01:19:23,902
- Who the?
- She's talking about me.

1523
01:19:23,936 --> 01:19:25,396
I'm the love your your life?

1524
01:19:25,421 --> 01:19:27,066
I don't know,
I'm still angry at you.

1525
01:19:27,109 --> 01:19:28,651
Héctor? How did you...

1526
01:19:28,676 --> 01:19:30,861
And that's for trying
to murder my grandson!

1527
01:19:30,886 --> 01:19:33,229
- Grandson?
- She's talking about me.

1528
01:19:33,254 --> 01:19:34,547
You!

1529
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:37,585
Wait. You're related to Héctor?

1530
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:39,036
The photo!

1531
01:19:40,638 --> 01:19:42,055
Eh...

1532
01:19:42,781 --> 01:19:44,142
After him!

1533
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:47,928
Security, ayuda.

1534
01:19:48,674 --> 01:19:50,171
You said love of your life?

1535
01:19:50,196 --> 01:19:51,576
I don't know what I said.

1536
01:19:51,601 --> 01:19:53,300
That's what I heard.

1537
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:08,239
Places, señor.
You're on in 30 seconds.

1538
01:20:15,927 --> 01:20:17,831
Miguel, I have it!

1539
01:20:26,382 --> 01:20:27,437
Oh!

1540
01:20:33,687 --> 01:20:34,775
Hurry, come on!

1541
01:20:37,144 --> 01:20:38,833
Ladies and gentleman!

1542
01:20:38,878 --> 01:20:44,865
The one. The only.
Ernesto de la Cruz!

1543
01:20:53,919 --> 01:20:55,348
Get her off the stage!

1544
01:21:03,889 --> 01:21:04,989
Sing!

1545
01:21:05,408 --> 01:21:06,519

You... still got it.

1572
01:23:01,428 --> 01:23:03,231
Uh-h-hum...

1573
01:23:03,256 --> 01:23:04,782
Oh!

1574
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:09,646
Miguel, I give you my blessing...

1575
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:12,433
To go home...

1576
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:15,143
To put up our photos...

1577
01:23:15,168 --> 01:23:16,979
And to never...

1578
01:23:17,004 --> 01:23:19,190
Never play music again.

1579
01:23:19,769 --> 01:23:24,939
To never forget how much
your family loves you.

1580
01:23:27,272 --> 01:23:28,995
You're going home.

1581
01:23:32,644 --> 01:23:34,356
You're not going anywhere!

1582
01:23:35,806 --> 01:23:37,179
Imelda!

1583
01:23:37,249 --> 01:23:38,902
Stay back! Stay back!

1584
01:23:38,927 --> 01:23:41,045
All of you, stay back!

1585
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:42,837
Not one more step.

1586
01:23:44,503 --> 01:23:45,819
Dante!

1587
01:23:47,474 --> 01:23:49,163
Ernesto, stop!

1588
01:23:50,138 --> 01:23:51,760
Leave the boy alone.

1589
01:23:51,785 --> 01:23:53,676
I've worked too hard, Héctor.

1590
01:23:53,701 --> 01:23:55,895
Too hard to let him
destroy everything.

1591
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,822
He's a living child, Ernesto.

1592
01:23:57,847 --> 01:23:59,535
He's a threat.

1593
01:23:59,647 --> 01:24:03,806
You think I'd let him go back to the
Land of the Living with your photo?

1594
01:24:03,831 --> 01:24:05,665
To keep your memory alive?

1595
01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:07,309
- No.
- You're a coward!

1596
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:10,972
I am Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician of all time.

1597
01:24:10,997 --> 01:24:12,978
Héctor's the real musician.

1598
01:24:13,003 --> 01:24:15,834
You're just the guy who
murdered him and stole his songs.

1599
01:24:15,859 --> 01:24:17,083
Murdered?

1600
01:24:17,108 --> 01:24:19,587
I am the one who's
willing to do what it takes

1601
01:24:19,611 --> 01:24:21,611
to seize my moment.

1602
01:24:21,635 --> 01:24:23,635
Whatever it takes.

1603
01:24:23,798 --> 01:24:25,589
Aah! Aah!

1604
01:24:25,669 --> 01:24:27,007
No!

1605
01:24:28,501 --> 01:24:30,327
- Miguel!
- Miguel!

1606
01:24:30,802 --> 01:24:34,238
Apologies, old friend.
But the show must go on.

1607
01:25:09,781 --> 01:25:11,425
Haha!

1608
01:25:11,614 --> 01:25:13,620
Boo! Boo!

1609
01:25:13,879 --> 01:25:15,999
Boo!

1610
01:25:16,282 --> 01:25:19,321
Hahaha! Please, please,
mi familia!

1611
01:25:19,346 --> 01:25:20,713
- Murderer!
- Get off the stage!

1612
01:25:20,738 --> 01:25:23,732
Orchestra, a-one, a-two, a-one...

1613
01:25:25,894 --> 01:25:27,981
♪ Remember me ♪

1614
01:25:28,006 --> 01:25:29,284

1615
01:25:29,309 --> 01:25:31,019
Hey, creep!

1616
01:25:32,017 --> 01:25:33,287
Look!

1617
01:25:53,444 --> 01:25:54,634
Nice kitty.

1618
01:25:56,616 --> 01:25:57,648
Ah!

1619
01:25:58,768 --> 01:26:00,242
Put me down!

1620
01:26:00,267 --> 01:26:01,307
Please!

1621
01:26:01,332 --> 01:26:03,009
I'm begging you!
Stop, stop!

1622
01:26:03,677 --> 01:26:04,890
Aaah!

1623
01:26:06,929 --> 01:26:08,732
Aah! Aaah!

1624
01:26:10,058 --> 01:26:12,246
Oooh!

1625
01:26:12,504 --> 01:26:14,069
Oh! No!

1626
01:26:14,126 --> 01:26:15,181
Aaah!

1627
01:26:17,332 --> 01:26:18,273
Hunh!

1628
01:26:25,505 --> 01:26:26,956
What did I miss?

1629
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:28,668
Good boy, Dante.

1630
01:26:28,693 --> 01:26:30,119
Miguel!

1631
01:26:30,255 --> 01:26:31,591
Oh!

1632
01:26:31,616 --> 01:26:33,090
Héctor!

1633
01:26:33,725 --> 01:26:35,459
The photo, I lost it.

1634
01:26:35,527 --> 01:26:37,205
It's okay, mijo.

1635
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:38,586
It's...

1636
01:26:38,611 --> 01:26:40,264
Héctor!

1637
01:26:40,545 --> 01:26:42,008
Héctor?

1638
01:26:42,532 --> 01:26:43,881
Coco.

1639
01:26:44,099 --> 01:26:45,865
No, we can still find the photo.

1640
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:48,099
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.

1641
01:26:48,348 --> 01:26:50,684
No, no, no.
I can't leave you.

1642
01:26:50,709 --> 01:26:52,825
I promised I put your photo up.

1643
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:55,126
I promised you'd see Coco.

1644
01:26:55,455 --> 01:26:57,666
We're both out of time, mijo.

1645
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:00,496
No! No!

1646
01:27:00,521 --> 01:27:02,390
She can't forget you.

1647
01:27:02,415 --> 01:27:04,555
I just wanted her to know...

1648
01:27:04,827 --> 01:27:06,664
that I loved her.

1649
01:27:06,902 --> 01:27:08,297
Héctor!

1650
01:27:08,396 --> 01:27:10,755
You have our blessing, Miguel.

1651
01:27:11,004 --> 01:27:13,374
No conditions.

1652
01:27:13,555 --> 01:27:16,367
No, Papá Héctor. Please!

1653
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:21,489
No.

1654
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:24,006
Go home.

1655
01:27:24,031 --> 01:27:27,110
I promise! I-I won't let
Coco forget you!

1656
01:27:54,628 --> 01:27:55,785
There he is!

1657
01:27:56,703 --> 01:27:58,597
Miguel! Stop!

1658
01:28:03,701 --> 01:28:04,903
Where have you been?

1659
01:28:04,928 --> 01:28:07,046
Ah! I need to see
Mamá Coco, please!

1660
01:28:07,071 --> 01:28:08,826
Huh! What are you doing with that?

1661
01:28:08,851 --> 01:28:09,936
Give it to me!

1662
01:28:09,961 --> 01:28:11,546
Miguel, stop.

1663
01:28:11,571 --> 01:28:14,063
Miguel! Miguel?

1664
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:15,571
Miguel!

1665
01:28:15,934 --> 01:28:17,272
Mamá Coco?

1666
01:28:17,297 --> 01:28:18,564
Can you hear me?

1667
01:28:18,589 --> 01:28:19,979
It's Miguel.

1668
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,997
I-I saw your Papá!

1669
01:28:22,022 --> 01:28:24,537
Remember? Papá?

1670
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,431
Please.

1671
01:28:26,576 --> 01:28:28,231
If you forget him.

1672
01:28:28,256 --> 01:28:29,739
He'll be gone.

1673
01:28:29,773 --> 01:28:31,258
Forever.

1674
01:28:32,526 --> 01:28:35,644
Here. This was his guitar, right?

1675
01:28:35,669 --> 01:28:37,741
He used to play it to you?

1676
01:28:39,816 --> 01:28:41,823
See, there he is.

1677
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:46,473
Papá, remember? Papá?

1678
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:50,438
Miguel!

1679
01:28:50,463 --> 01:28:53,627
Mamá Coco, please.
Don't forget him.

1680
01:28:58,965 --> 01:29:02,060
What are you doing
to that poor woman?

1681
01:29:02,084 --> 01:29:03,170
It's okay, mother.

1682
01:29:03,195 --> 01:29:04,497
What's gotten into you?

1683
01:29:10,914 --> 01:29:12,864
I thought I lost you, Miguel.

1684
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:14,563
I'm sorry, Papá.

1685
01:29:14,588 --> 01:29:16,184
We're all together now.

1686
01:29:16,209 --> 01:29:18,281
That's what matters.

1687
01:29:18,306 --> 01:29:19,903
Not all of us.

1688
01:29:19,928 --> 01:29:21,819
It's okay, Mamita.

1689
01:29:21,844 --> 01:29:25,809
Miguel, you apologize
to your Mamá Coco.

1690
01:29:28,656 --> 01:29:30,073
Mamá Coco...

1691
01:29:35,196 --> 01:29:37,191
Well, apologize.

1692
01:29:41,067 --> 01:29:42,563
Mamá Coco...

1693
01:29:42,756 --> 01:29:44,627
Your Papá...

1694
01:29:44,651 --> 01:29:47,098
He wanted you to have this.

1695
01:29:48,347 --> 01:29:50,399

Nothing, Mamá.

Nothing at all.

1717
01:31:10,057 --> 01:31:14,297
My Papá used to
sing me that song.

1718
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:16,868
He loved you, Mamá Coco.

Your Papá loved you so much.

1720
01:31:39,378 --> 01:31:43,040
I kept his letters.

1721
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:46,041
Poems he wrote me.

1722
01:31:46,732 --> 01:31:48,569
And...

1723
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:10,029
Papá was a musician.

1724
01:32:10,174 --> 01:32:12,555
When I was a little girl...

1725
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:18,258
He and Mamá would sing
such beautiful songs.

1726
