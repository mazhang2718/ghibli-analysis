1
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:48,756
<i>This is Agent Leland Turbo.</i>

2
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:50,854
<i>I have a flash transmission
for Agent Finn McMissile.</i>

3
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:55,868
<i>Finn, my cover's been compromised.
Everything's gone pear-shaped.</i>

4
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:59,906
<i>You won't believe what I found out here.</i>

5
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,307
<i>This is bigger than anything we've ever
seen, and no one even knows it exists.</i>

6
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:08,403
<i>Finn, I need backup, but don't call
the cavalry, it could blow the operation.</i>

7
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:10,950
<i>- And be careful. It's not safe out here.
Let's go.</i>

8
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:13,519
<i>Transmitting my grids now. Good luck.</i>

9
00:01:47,253 --> 00:01:47,948
All right, buddy, we're here.

10
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:48,644
All right, buddy, we're here.

11
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:51,323
Right where you paid me to bring you.

12
00:01:51,424 --> 00:01:53,414
Question is, why?

13
00:01:53,558 --> 00:01:55,992
I'm looking for a car.

14
00:01:56,128 --> 00:01:57,719
A car? Ha!

15
00:01:57,862 --> 00:02:01,230
Hey, pal, you can't get any further away
from land than out here.

16
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:02,993
Exactly where I want to be.

17
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:06,968
I got news for you, buddy.
There's nobody out here but us.

18
00:02:08,873 --> 00:02:10,568
What are you doing out here?

19
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:13,235
What does it look like, genius?
I'm crabbing.

20
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:17,247
Well, turn around
and go back where you came from.

21
00:02:17,383 --> 00:02:19,317
Yeah, and who's gonna make me?

22
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:23,420
All right. All right.
Don't get your prop in a twist.

23
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:28,353
What a jerk. Sorry, buddy.
Looks like it's the end of the line.

24
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:30,252
Buddy?

25
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:36,123
<i>Incoming.
All workers report to the loading dock.</i>

26
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:40,626
Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile.
I'm at the rally point. Over.

27
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:44,329
All right, fellas, you know the drill.

28
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:47,063
Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over.

29
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:53,235
Come on, guys. These crates
aren't gonna unload themselves.

30
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,271
<i>Too many cars here. Out of my way.</i>

31
00:03:57,383 --> 00:03:59,612
Professor ZÃÂ¼ndapp?

32
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:01,146
Here it is, Professor. You wanted to
see this before we load it?

33
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:02,575
Here it is, Professor. You wanted to
see this before we load it?

34
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:04,621
Ah, yes. Very carefully.

35
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:07,020
Oh, a TV camera.

36
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,616
- What does it actually do?
- This camera is extremely dangerous.

37
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:12,525
What are you up to now, Professor?

38
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:29,242
This is valuable equipment. Make sure
it is properly secured for the voyage.

39
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:31,247
<i>- You got it.
- Hey, Professor Z!</i>

40
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:33,840
This is one of those
British spies we told you about.

41
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:38,012
Yeah! This one we caught sticking
his bumper where it didn't belong.

42
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:40,351
Agent Leland Turbo.

43
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:49,026
It's Finn McMissile!

44
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,091
He's seen the camera! Kill him!

45
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:55,334
<i>All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!</i>

46
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:17,995
Whoa!

47
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:24,935
Waargh!

48
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:17,254
What?

49
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:32,598
Get to the boats!

50
00:06:57,728 --> 00:07:00,095
- He's getting away!
- Not for long!

51
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:37,663
<i>He's dead, Professor.</i>

52
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:39,427
<i>Wunderbar!</i>

53
00:07:39,536 --> 00:07:43,268
With Finn McMissile gone,
who can stop us now?

54
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:48,502
Mater -Tow Mater, that's who -
is here to help you.

55
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:52,995
- Hey, Otis!
- Hey, Mater.

56
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:54,408
- Hey, Otis!
- Hey, Mater.

57
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,951
I... Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

58
00:07:57,052 --> 00:07:59,283
I thought I could make it this time, but...

59
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:04,759
Smooth like pudding, huh?

60
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,319
Who am I kidding?
I'll always be a lemon.

61
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,958
Well, dad-gum, you're leaking oil again.
Must be your gaskets.

62
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:13,500
Hey, but look on the bright side.

63
00:08:13,636 --> 00:08:16,901
This is your tenth tow this month,
so it's on the house.

64
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:20,442
You're the only one
that's nice to lemons like me, Mater.

65
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:23,908
Don't sweat it. Shoot,
these things happen to everybody.

66
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:27,312
- But you never leak oil.
- Yeah, but I ain't perfect.

67
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:30,783
Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust
is starting to show through.

68
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,717
Hey. Is Lightning McQueen back yet?

69
00:08:32,822 --> 00:08:33,852
Not yet.

70
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,884
Not yet.

71
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,517
He must be crazy excited
about winning his fourth Piston Cup.

72
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,990
Four! Wow!

73
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:43,758
Yeah, we're so dad-gum proud of him,
but I wish he'd hurry up and get back,

74
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:47,062
'cause we got a whole summer's worth
of best friend fun to make up for.

75
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:48,395
Just me and...

76
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,000
McQueen!

77
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:53,370
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- McQueen!

78
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:57,036
- Mater! I'm in no hurry!
- Hey, everybody. McQueen's back!

79
00:08:57,178 --> 00:08:59,009
- Aaah!
- McQueen's back!

80
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:03,049
- McQueen's back! McQueen's back!
- Aaah! Oooh-hoo! Oooh-hah!

81
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:04,777
McQueen's back!

82
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:07,480
Oh, Lightning! Welcome home!

83
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:11,149
- Good to have you back, honey!
- Congratulations, man.

84
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,486
Welcome home, soldier.

85
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:14,958
The place wasn't the same without you,
son.

86
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:16,360
What? Did he go somewhere?

87
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:17,657
What? Did he go somewhere?

88
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:21,198
It's good to be home, everybody.

89
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:22,701
- Mater!
- McQueen!

90
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,198
- Mater!
- McQueen!

91
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:25,897
Oooh!

92
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:29,676
Whoooa!

93
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:32,709
Hey,
how far did you make it this time, Otis?

94
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:36,715
- Halfway to the county line.
- Ooh, not bad, man!

95
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,408
I know! I can't believe it either!

96
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,386
- McQueen! Welcome back!
- Mater, it's so good to see you.

97
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,717
You too, buddy.

98
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:47,316
Oh, man, you ain't going to believe
the things I got planned for us!

99
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,974
These best friend greetings
get longer every year!

100
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:50,488
These best friend greetings
get longer every year!

101
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,143
- You ready to have some serious fun?
- I've got something to show you first.

102
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:55,456
- You ready to have some serious fun?
- I've got something to show you first.

103
00:09:56,436 --> 00:09:57,596
Wow.

104
00:09:57,736 --> 00:10:00,102
I can't believe
they renamed the Piston Cup

105
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:03,332
after our very own Doc Hudson.

106
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:05,841
I know Doc said these things
were just old cups,

107
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:10,109
but to have someone else win it
just didn't feel right, you know?

108
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:17,110
Doc would've been real proud of you.
That's for sure.

109
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:23,419
All right, pal.
I've been waiting all summer for this.

110
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:26,657
- What you got planned?
- Ho-ho-ho! You sure you can handle it?

111
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:30,235
Do you know who you're talking to?
This is Lightning McQueen!

112
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:32,303
I can handle anything.

113
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,133
Er... Mater?

114
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:37,470
Just remember, your brakes
ain't going to work on these!

115
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:39,475
- Mater?
- Relax.

116
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:42,138
These train tracks
ain't been used in years!

117
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,340
Aaaah!

118
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:46,474
- Aaaah!
- Faster, faster. Come on. Here we go!

119
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:48,052
Faster!

120
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:53,485
Ooh. Wow.

121
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:57,049
Yeah, I don't know. Do you think?

122
00:10:57,162 --> 00:10:59,153
This is going to be good!

123
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:10,537
Did you see that?

124
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:14,778
Uh-oh.
This ain't going to be good.

125
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:20,585
Ha-ha! Boy, this was the best day ever!

126
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:24,018
And my favorite souvenir,
this new dent.

127
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:27,716
- Boy, Mater, today was ah...
- Shoot, that was nothing.

128
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,020
Wait till you see
what I got planned for tonight!

129
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:34,495
Mater, Mater, whoa!
I was thinking of just a quiet dinner.

130
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,932
That's exactly what I was thinkin'.

131
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:41,403
- No, I meant with Sally, Mater.
- Even better!

132
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:44,907
You, me and Miss Sally
goin' out for supper.

133
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:47,205
Mater, I meant it would be
just me and Sally.

134
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:51,513
- Oh.
- You know, just for tonight.

135
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,582
- Oh...
- We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.

136
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:56,614
OK.

137
00:11:56,754 --> 00:11:59,154
- Thanks for understanding.
- Yeah, sure.

138
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:03,227
- Y'all go on and have fun now.
- All right, then.

139
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:05,455
See you soon, amigo.

140
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,528
Ah, this is so nice.

141
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:16,573
I can't tell you how good it is
to be here alone,

142
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:18,471
just the two of us, finally.

143
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,009
- You and me.
Ahem! Good evening.

144
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:22,977
- Oh!
- My name is Mater,

145
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:24,572
and I'll be your waiter.

146
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:27,345
Mater the waiter.
That's funny right there.

147
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:29,443
Mater? You work here?

148
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:31,418
Yeah, I work here. What'd you think?

149
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:33,251
I snuck in here
when nobody was lookin'

150
00:12:33,392 --> 00:12:35,985
and pretended to be your waiter
so I could hang out with you?

151
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:39,860
Oh, yeah.
How ridiculous would that be?

152
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:43,161
Can I start you two lovebirds off
with a couple of drinks?

153
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:47,398
- Yes. I'll have my usual.
- You know what? I'll have that, too.

154
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,373
Uh... Right. Your usual.

155
00:12:59,684 --> 00:13:01,585
<i>- Thanks, man.
- Grazie, Guido.</i>

156
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,245
Guido, what's McQueen's usual?

157
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:04,514
How should I know?

158
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:07,648
- Perfect. Give me two of them.
- Quiet! My program's on.

159
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,023
<i>Tonight on the Mel Dorado Show...</i>

160
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:11,892
<i>His story gripped the world.</i>

161
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,395
<i>Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod,</i>

162
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,397
<i>in an attempt to become the first car to
circumnavigate the globe without GPS,</i>

163
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:18,294
<i>in an attempt to become the first car to
circumnavigate the globe without GPS,</i>

164
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:21,701
<i>ironically ran out of gas,
and found himself trapped in the wild.</i>

165
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:24,602
<i>Feared dead, he emerged 36 days later,</i>

166
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:28,337
<i>running on a fuel he distilled himself
from the natural elements!</i>

167
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:30,504
<i>Since then, he's sold his oil fortune,</i>

168
00:13:30,648 --> 00:13:33,480
<i>converted himself from a gas-guzzler
into an electric car</i>

169
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:36,746
<i>and has devoted his life to finding
a renewable, clean-burning fuel.</i>

170
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:38,879
<i>Now he claims to have done it
with his allinol.</i>

171
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,486
<i>And to show the world
what his new super fuel can do</i>

172
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:41,984
<i>And to show the world
what his new super fuel can do</i>

173
00:13:42,091 --> 00:13:44,322
<i>he's created a racing competition
like no other,</i>

174
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:46,326
<i>inviting the greatest champions</i>

175
00:13:46,462 --> 00:13:48,453
<i>to battle in the first ever
World Grand Prix.</i>

176
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:50,692
Welcome, Sir Miles Axlerod.

177
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:52,498
Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here.
Listen to me.

178
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:53,796
Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here.
Listen to me.

179
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,096
Big oil. It costs a fortune.
Pollution is getting worse.

180
00:13:57,206 --> 00:14:00,664
I mean, it's a fossil fuel.
"Fossil," as in dead dinosaurs.

181
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:03,510
And we all know
what happened to them.

182
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:06,341
Alternative energy is the future.
Trust me, Mel.

183
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:09,383
After seeing allinol in action
at the World Grand Prix,

184
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:13,249
<i>nobody will ever go back
to gasoline again.</i>

185
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:14,322
What happened to the dinosaurs, now?

186
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,246
And on satellite,
a World Grand Prix competitor

187
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,520
and one of the fastest cars in the world,
Francesco Bernoulli.

188
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:24,086
<i>It is an honor, Signore Dorado,
for you.</i>

189
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,893
Why not invite Lightning McQueen?

190
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,524
<i>Of course we invited him,</i>

191
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:30,034
but apparently after his very long
racing season

192
00:14:30,138 --> 00:14:32,129
he is taking time off to rest.

193
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,676
The Lightning McQueen would not
have a chance against Francesco.

194
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:38,904
I can go over 300 kilometers an hour.

195
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:43,881
In miles, that is like...
way faster than McQueen.

196
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:46,918
Let's go to the phones.
Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air.

197
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,284
<i>- Am I on? Hello?
- You're on. Go ahead.</i>

198
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,687
<i>- Hello?
- Go ahead.</i>

199
00:14:51,926 --> 00:14:54,360
Let's go to Radiator Springs.
You're on, caller.

200
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:57,192
<i>That Italian feller
you got on there</i>

201
00:14:57,298 --> 00:14:58,192
<i>can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen.</i>

202
00:14:58,227 --> 00:14:59,088
<i>Can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen.</i>

203
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,395
He's the bestest race car
in the whole wide world.

204
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:05,299
<i>- Uh-oh.
- If he is, how you say,</i>

205
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,307
"the bestest race car,"
then why must he rest? Huh?

206
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,932
<i>'Cause he knows
what's important.</i>

207
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,638
<i>Every now and then he prefers
just to slow down, enjoy life.</i>

208
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,807
Oh! You heard it!
Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow!

209
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,644
This is not news to Francesco.

210
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:21,049
When I want to go to sleep,
I watch one of his races.

211
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,745
<i>After two laps, I am out cold.</i>

212
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,051
That ain't what I meant.

213
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,355
McQUEEN: What's going on
over there?

214
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,056
<i>He is afraid of Francesco.</i>

215
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,428
McQUEEN: That's that
Italian formula car.

216
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:36,831
- His name is...
- Francesco Bernoulli.

217
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,336
- No wonder there's a crowd.
- Why do you know his name?

218
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,238
And don't say it like that.
It's three syllables, not ten.

219
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,777
What? He's nice to look at.
You know, open-wheeled and all.

220
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,438
What's wrong with fenders?
I thought you liked my fenders.

221
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,110
<i>- Let me tell you something else.
- Mater?</i>

222
00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:51,640
<i>- Let me tell you something else.
- Mater?</i>

223
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,311
<i>McQueen could drive circles
around you.</i>

224
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,389
Driving in circles is all he can-a do,
no?

225
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:57,456
<i>No.</i>

226
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:01,220
I mean, yes.
I mean, he could beat you anywhere.

227
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,453
Any time, any track.

228
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:04,461
Mel, can we move on?

229
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,428
Francesco needs a caller
who can provide

230
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,764
<i>a little more intellectual stimulation,
like a dump truck.</i>

231
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:13,201
Ha-ha! That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.

232
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,466
Hey! Whoa!

233
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,635
Yeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen.

234
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,677
The Lightning McQueen, huh?

235
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,213
<i>I don't appreciate my best friend
being insulted like that.</i>

236
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,661
McQueen, that was your best friend?
Oh!

237
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:26,006
McQueen, that was your best friend?
Oh!

238
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,211
This is the difference
between you and Francesco.

239
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,583
Francesco knows how good he is.

240
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:33,919
He does not need to surround himself
with tow trucks to prove it.

241
00:16:34,058 --> 00:16:37,825
Those are strong words
from a car that is so fragile.

242
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:41,923
Fragile! He calls Francesco fragile!

243
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,226
Not-a so fast, McQueen!

244
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,548
"Not so fast. "
Is that your new motto?

245
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:45,761
"Not so fast. "
Is that your new motto?

246
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,806
Motto?

247
00:16:49,907 --> 00:16:53,808
This sounds like something that needs
to be settled on the race course.

248
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:57,937
What do you say, Lightning McQueen?
We've got room for one more racer.

249
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:01,447
I would love to,
but my crew is off for the season, so...

250
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:04,421
Pit stop.

251
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:06,854
You know what? They just got back.

252
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,481
Deal me in, baby.

253
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,491
Ka-chow! Yeah.

254
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:10,924
Ka-chow! Yeah.

255
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:16,558
I know, I know.
I just got back, but we won't be long.

256
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:19,361
No, don't worry about me.
I've got enough to do here.

257
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:21,333
Mater's going to have a blast, though.

258
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:23,165
You're bringing Mater, right?

259
00:17:23,306 --> 00:17:25,672
You never bring him
to any of your races.

260
00:17:31,314 --> 00:17:32,337
Ah.

261
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:34,779
Just let him sit in the pits.
Give him a headset.

262
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:37,182
Come on, it will be
the thrill of a lifetime for him.

263
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:39,288
- Your drink, sir.
- Mater.

264
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:40,720
I didn't taste it!

265
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:43,552
How'd you like to come
and see the world with me?

266
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:46,526
- You mean it?
- Yeah. You got me into this thing.

267
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:48,688
- You're coming along.
- All right!

268
00:17:58,575 --> 00:17:59,940
Ka-chow!

269
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:01,372
Ha-ha!

270
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:02,167
Ha-ha!

271
00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:16,377
Hey!

272
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:17,074
Hey!

273
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:26,952
Hey, excuse me!

274
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:29,027
<i>Domo arigato!</i>

275
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,900
Yeah!

276
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:04,930
Guido, look. Ferraris and tires.

277
00:20:05,064 --> 00:20:08,056
- Let's go!
- Ho-ho! Look at this.

278
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,329
OK, now, Mater, remember,
best behavior.

279
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,733
- You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that?
- Mater!

280
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:15,017
Hey, McQueen! Over here.

281
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:16,162
Hey, McQueen! Over here.

282
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:17,365
- Lewis!
- Hey, man.

283
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:19,067
- Jeff!
- Hey, Lightning.

284
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,837
Can you believe this party?

285
00:20:26,284 --> 00:20:27,250
Hey.

286
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:30,713
You done good. You got all the leaves.

287
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,313
- Check out that tow truck.
- Man, I wonder who that guy's with.

288
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,221
Ah... Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

289
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:37,986
Ah... Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

290
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:40,092
Ho-ho! Good job!

291
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,758
Mater!
Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.

292
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:45,266
You're just realizing that?

293
00:20:45,402 --> 00:20:48,633
Oh-ho! That jet lag really done
a number on you.

294
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:51,333
Mater, things are different over here.

295
00:20:51,474 --> 00:20:55,501
Which means maybe you should,
you know, act a little different, too.

296
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:58,375
- Different than what?
- Well, just help me out here.

297
00:20:58,515 --> 00:21:01,075
You need help? Shoot!
Why didn't you say so?

298
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:03,048
That's what a tow truck does.

299
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:04,744
- Yeah, I mean...
- Looky there.

300
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:07,549
It's Mr. San Francisco.
I'll introduce you.

301
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:10,285
- Mater, no!
- Look at me. I'm helping you already.

302
00:21:10,426 --> 00:21:13,088
Hey, Mr. San Francisco,
I'd like you to meet...

303
00:21:13,195 --> 00:21:15,288
<i>Ah, Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.</i>

304
00:21:15,432 --> 00:21:18,195
- Nice to meet you, Francesco.
- Nice to meet you, too.

305
00:21:18,335 --> 00:21:21,133
You are very good-looking.
Not as good as I thought, but good.

306
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,103
Excuse me.
Can I get a picture with you?

307
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:24,934
Anything for McQueen's friend.

308
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,375
Miss Sally is going to flip
when she sees this.

309
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:31,503
She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.

310
00:21:31,615 --> 00:21:33,708
- Oooh!
- She's a big fan of yours.

311
00:21:33,817 --> 00:21:35,682
Hey, she has-a good taste.

312
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:39,153
Mater's prone to exaggeration.
I wouldn't say she's a "big fan".

313
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,587
You're right. She's a huge fan!

314
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:44,522
She goes on and on
about your open wheels.

315
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:47,893
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
as going on and on.

316
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:51,558
Francesco is familiar
with this reaction to Francesco.

317
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,727
Women respect a car
that has-a nothing to hide.

318
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:55,326
Yeah, er...

319
00:21:55,471 --> 00:21:56,996
- Let us have a toast.
- Let's.

320
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,040
I dedicate my win tomorrow
to Miss Sally.

321
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:01,165
Oh. Sorry.

322
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,405
I already dedicated
my win tomorrow to her.

323
00:22:04,548 --> 00:22:06,948
So, if we both do it,
it's really not so special.

324
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:10,451
- Besides, I don't have a drink.
- I'll go get you one.

325
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:12,987
Do you mind if I borrow a few bucks
for one of them drinks?

326
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:16,457
- They're free.
- Free? Shoot, what am I doing here?

327
00:22:16,593 --> 00:22:20,586
I should probably go keep an eye
on him. See you at the race.

328
00:22:20,696 --> 00:22:24,598
Yes, you will see Francesco,
but not like this.

329
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:28,329
You will see him like-a this
as he drives away from you.

330
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:29,961
Ha! That's cute.

331
00:22:30,073 --> 00:22:32,336
You had one of those made up
for all the racers?

332
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,602
No.

333
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,971
Okay.

334
00:22:35,077 --> 00:22:38,569
- Ciao, McQueen!
- He is so getting beat tomorrow!

335
00:22:38,682 --> 00:22:43,243
<i>Ladies and gentlecars,
Sir Miles Axlerod.</i>

336
00:22:43,386 --> 00:22:47,049
It is my absolute honor
to introduce to you

337
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,286
the competitors in the first ever
World Grand Prix.

338
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,027
From Brazil, Number 8...

339
00:23:15,147 --> 00:23:16,808
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

340
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:19,476
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.

341
00:23:19,618 --> 00:23:21,279
That's because it's air-cooled.

342
00:23:21,421 --> 00:23:25,084
Great. I'm Agent Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo station.

343
00:23:25,224 --> 00:23:27,215
- I have a message from London.
- Not here.

344
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:29,227
Try the canapÃÂ©s on the mezzanine.

345
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:36,894
The lab boys analyzed the photo I sent?
What did they learn about the camera?

346
00:23:37,036 --> 00:23:39,197
It appears to be
a standard television camera.

347
00:23:39,305 --> 00:23:42,398
They said if you could get closer
photos next time that would be great.

348
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,804
This was London's message?

349
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,105
Oh, no. No, sir.

350
00:23:46,246 --> 00:23:47,873
The oil platforms you were on,

351
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,915
turns out they're sitting on
the biggest oil reserve in the world.

352
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:52,243
How did we miss that?

353
00:23:52,352 --> 00:23:54,319
They've scrambled
everyone's satellites.

354
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:56,648
The Americans discovered it
just before you did.

355
00:23:56,756 --> 00:23:59,656
They placed an agent on that platform
under deep cover.

356
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:02,886
He was able to get a photo of the car
who's running the entire operation.

357
00:24:02,996 --> 00:24:03,962
Great.

358
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,429
Who is it?
Has anyone seen the photo yet?

359
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:07,931
Nope, not yet.

360
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:10,729
The American is here tonight
to pass it to you.

361
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:12,359
He'll signal you when he's ready.

362
00:24:12,505 --> 00:24:14,028
Good, good.

363
00:24:14,874 --> 00:24:16,171
Oh, no.

364
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:19,942
- What is it?
- Change of plan.

365
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:21,943
- You're meeting the American.
- What? Me?

366
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,276
Those thugs down there
were on the oil platform.

367
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:26,375
If they see me,
the mission is compromised.

368
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:31,547
No, I'm technical. I'm in diagnostics.
I'm... I'm not a field agent.

369
00:24:31,657 --> 00:24:32,646
You are now.

370
00:24:36,962 --> 00:24:38,692
I'll take one of them. Thank you.

371
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:41,323
Never know which one McQueen
will have a hankering for.

372
00:24:44,304 --> 00:24:48,297
Hey. What you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?

373
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:51,974
- No, no, wasabi.
- Same old same old.

374
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:54,772
What's up with you?
That looks delicious!

375
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:01,884
Er... little more, please.
It is free, right?

376
00:25:01,988 --> 00:25:04,080
Keep it coming. A little more.

377
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,817
Come on, let's go. It's free.

378
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,755
You're gettin' there. Scoop, scoop.

379
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:10,453
There ya go!
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

380
00:25:11,663 --> 00:25:13,393
My condolences.

381
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,633
And now our last competitor.

382
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:20,364
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!

383
00:25:20,472 --> 00:25:21,701
Ka-chow!

384
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:24,402
Thank you so much for having us,
Sir Axlerod.

385
00:25:24,544 --> 00:25:27,980
I really look forward to racing.
This is a great opportunity.

386
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,413
Oh, the pleasure is all ours, Lightning.

387
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:33,644
You and your team bring
excellence and professionalism

388
00:25:33,752 --> 00:25:34,845
to this competition.

389
00:25:38,891 --> 00:25:41,018
Somebody get me water! Aah!

390
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,423
Oh, sweet relief. Sweet relief.

391
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:56,940
Whatever you do,
do not eat the free pistachio ice cream.

392
00:25:57,442 --> 00:25:59,376
It has turned.

393
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:01,742
Sir Axlerod, I can explain.

394
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:04,544
- This is Mater. He's...
- I know him.

395
00:26:04,683 --> 00:26:07,209
This is the bloke that called in
to the television show.

396
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:10,049
- You're the one I have to thank.
- No, thank you.

397
00:26:10,189 --> 00:26:11,816
This trip's been amazin'.

398
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:14,289
Ah. He's a little excited, isn't he?

399
00:26:14,426 --> 00:26:17,759
- Mater!
- But wait, I... Oh, shoot.

400
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:20,058
- Mater.
- Has anyone got a towel?

401
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:22,666
Mater, get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

402
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:27,239
- But I never leak oil. Never.
- Go take care of yourself right now!

403
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,209
Comin' through! Leakin' oil.
Where's the bathroom? Thank you.

404
00:26:35,047 --> 00:26:37,277
I gotta go. Oh, er...

405
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:41,075
Er...

406
00:26:41,186 --> 00:26:43,177
Sorry, ladies.

407
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:46,155
I'm leakin'. I never leak. I never leak.

408
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:48,954
I never leak, I never leak, I never leak.

409
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,894
Oh, oh, I never leak. Oooh!

410
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,021
I never leak, I never leak, never...

411
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:56,067
Wow-wee!

412
00:27:01,807 --> 00:27:03,776
What in the?

413
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:15,281
Hey, that tickles!

414
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:21,182
Waaargh!

415
00:27:28,835 --> 00:27:32,634
Okay, McMissile. I'm here.
It's time for the drop.

416
00:27:36,308 --> 00:27:39,744
OK, so, the American has activated
his tracking beacon.

417
00:27:39,878 --> 00:27:41,403
Roger that. Move in.

418
00:27:56,095 --> 00:27:57,153
Stop! Hey!

419
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:18,115
- Oh, you've got to be joking.
- What's the problem?

420
00:28:18,217 --> 00:28:19,980
<i>- He's in the loo.
- So, go in!</i>

421
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:22,747
<i>- I can't go into the men's loo!
- Time is of the essence.</i>

422
00:28:22,888 --> 00:28:24,856
All right.

423
00:28:31,297 --> 00:28:36,257
Oh! Whatever you do,
I would not go in there!

424
00:28:37,903 --> 00:28:40,463
Hey! A Gremlin and a Pacer!

425
00:28:40,573 --> 00:28:42,131
No offense to your makes and models,

426
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,903
but you break down harder
than my cousin Betsy

427
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,875
after she got left at the altar!

428
00:28:46,979 --> 00:28:49,209
What the? Whoa. Are you OK?

429
00:28:49,347 --> 00:28:51,373
- I'm fine.
- Hey! Tow truck!

430
00:28:51,517 --> 00:28:54,952
We'd like to get to our private business
here, if you don't mind.

431
00:28:55,054 --> 00:28:56,520
Oh, yeah, sorry.

432
00:28:56,622 --> 00:28:59,113
Don't let me get in the way
of your private business.

433
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:02,955
Oh, a little advice. When you hear
a giggle and see that waterfall,

434
00:29:03,061 --> 00:29:04,926
you best press that green button.

435
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,157
- Thank you.
- It's to adjust the temperature.

436
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:09,826
- Got it.
- And it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit.

437
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:11,367
Get out of here!

438
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,530
All right, then. And when she starts
gigglin', prepare to be squirted.

439
00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:18,307
'Scuse me, ma'am.

440
00:29:18,411 --> 00:29:20,310
Dad-gum pistachio ice cream.

441
00:29:20,413 --> 00:29:24,008
<i>- This cannot be him.
Is he American?</i>

442
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,448
Look out, ladies.
Mater's fittin' to get funky.

443
00:29:26,586 --> 00:29:28,917
<i>- Extremely.
- Then it's him.</i>

444
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:31,021
- Hello.
- Well, hello.

445
00:29:31,156 --> 00:29:33,785
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.

446
00:29:33,893 --> 00:29:36,452
Well, of course it doesn't.
That's 'cause it's air-cooled.

447
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:39,326
Perfect.
Erm... I'm from the Tokyo Station.

448
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:42,127
'Course, Karmann Ghias
weren't the only ones.

449
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:46,000
Besides the Beetles, you had Type 3
Squarebacks with the Pancake motors.

450
00:29:46,105 --> 00:29:48,403
- Yeah, OK. I get it.
- And before both of them

451
00:29:48,507 --> 00:29:50,201
there's the Type 2 buses.

452
00:29:50,308 --> 00:29:52,435
- My buddy Fillmore's one of them.
- Listen!

453
00:29:52,577 --> 00:29:54,272
Erm... We should find somewhere
more private.

454
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:57,146
Gee, don't you think that's a little?

455
00:29:57,249 --> 00:30:00,275
You're right. Impossible to know
which areas here are compromised.

456
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:02,579
- So, when can I see you again?
- Well, let's see.

457
00:30:02,688 --> 00:30:05,451
- Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races.
- Got it.

458
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,990
We'll rendezvous then.

459
00:30:08,126 --> 00:30:10,891
- There you are. Where have you been?
- What's a "rendezvous"?

460
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:12,792
- Er... It's like a date.
- A date?

461
00:30:12,897 --> 00:30:14,297
Mater, what's going on?

462
00:30:14,432 --> 00:30:17,163
What's going on is
I got me a date tomorrow.

463
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:19,169
Guido don't believe you.

464
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,297
Believe it.
My new girlfriend just said so.

465
00:30:22,441 --> 00:30:25,410
Hey, there she is. Hey! Hey, lady!

466
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,375
See you tomorrow!

467
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,913
Guido still don't believe you.

468
00:30:32,018 --> 00:30:35,852
- I got to admit, you tricked us real good.
- And we don't like being tricked.

469
00:30:35,954 --> 00:30:37,786
What's so funny?

470
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,986
Well, I was just wearing a disguise.
You guys are stuck looking like that.

471
00:30:44,563 --> 00:30:48,089
Allinol? Thanks, fellas.
I hear this stuff is good for you.

472
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:49,997
So you think.

473
00:30:50,102 --> 00:30:52,593
Allinol by itself is good for you.

474
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:59,040
But after microscopic examination

475
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:01,807
I have found
that it has one small weakness.

476
00:31:01,913 --> 00:31:04,711
When hit with
an electromagnetic pulse,

477
00:31:04,817 --> 00:31:07,808
it becomes extremely dangerous.

478
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,717
Smile for the camera.

479
00:31:09,888 --> 00:31:11,880
Is that all you want? I got a whole act.

480
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,482
You were very interested in this camera
on the oil platform.

481
00:31:15,594 --> 00:31:19,529
Now, you will witness
what it really does.

482
00:31:19,664 --> 00:31:23,259
- Whatever you say, Professor.
- You talked up a lot of cars last night.

483
00:31:23,368 --> 00:31:25,564
- Which one's your associate?
- Your mother.

484
00:31:25,704 --> 00:31:29,231
Oh, no, I'm sorry, it was your sister.
I can't tell them apart these days.

485
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,104
Could I start it now, Professor Z?

486
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,234
Go 50ÃÂ°% power.

487
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,144
This camera is actually
an electromagnetic pulse emitter.

488
00:31:39,285 --> 00:31:41,184
What about her? Did you give it to her?

489
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:44,585
The allinol is now heating to a boil,

490
00:31:44,723 --> 00:31:49,558
dramatically expanding, causing the
engine block to crack under the stress,

491
00:31:49,694 --> 00:31:52,128
forcing oil
into the combustion chamber.

492
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,096
How about him? Did you talk to him?

493
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:57,762
What do I care?
I can replace an engine block.

494
00:31:57,936 --> 00:32:01,201
You may be able to,
but after full impact of the pulse...

495
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:04,776
unfortunately...
there will be nothing to replace.

496
00:32:05,443 --> 00:32:07,912
How about him?
Does he have it?

497
00:32:11,983 --> 00:32:13,951
That's him. He's the one.

498
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,285
- Roger that, Professor Z.
- No!

499
00:32:16,387 --> 00:32:17,412
Yes, sir.

500
00:32:17,556 --> 00:32:21,423
We believe the infiltrator has passed
along sensitive information.

501
00:32:21,926 --> 00:32:24,724
I will take care of it
before any damage can be done.

502
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:27,789
The project is still on schedule.

503
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:31,367
You will find the second agent
and kill him.

504
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,106
<i>Japan, land of the rising sun,</i>

505
00:32:45,217 --> 00:32:47,741
<i>where ancient tradition
meets modern technology.</i>

506
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:49,748
<i>Welcome to the inaugural running
of the World Grand Prix.</i>

507
00:32:49,782 --> 00:32:51,643
<i>Welcome to the inaugural running
of the World Grand Prix.</i>

508
00:32:51,753 --> 00:32:53,846
I'm Brent Mustangburger
with racing legends

509
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:55,980
Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap.

510
00:32:56,092 --> 00:32:57,353
There's never been a competition
like this before.

511
00:32:57,387 --> 00:32:58,615
There's never been a competition
like this before.

512
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,990
First, allinol, making its debut tonight

513
00:33:01,095 --> 00:33:04,121
as the required fuel
for all these great champions.

514
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,061
Second, the course itself.

515
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:07,345
And it's like nothing
we've ever seen before.

516
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,523
And it's like nothing
we've ever seen before.

517
00:33:08,634 --> 00:33:11,102
<i>David, how exactly
does this competition work?</i>

518
00:33:11,203 --> 00:33:15,435
<i>All three of these street courses are
classic round-the-house racetracks.</i>

519
00:33:15,575 --> 00:33:17,440
<i>This means that the LMP
and formula cars</i>

520
00:33:17,576 --> 00:33:19,977
<i>should break out of the gate
in spectacular fashion.</i>

521
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:22,843
<i>Look for Francesco Bernoulli,
in particular, to lead early.</i>

522
00:33:23,015 --> 00:33:25,950
<i>And with technical turns throughout,
GT and touring cars,</i>

523
00:33:26,051 --> 00:33:28,451
<i>like Spain's Miguel Camino,
should make up ground</i>

524
00:33:28,587 --> 00:33:30,556
<i>but I doubt it'll be enough
to stop Francesco</i>

525
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:33,453
from absolutely running away with it.

526
00:33:33,593 --> 00:33:35,083
Whoa now. Hold your horsepower.

527
00:33:35,228 --> 00:33:37,058
You forget the most important factor -

528
00:33:37,163 --> 00:33:39,028
that early dirt track section
of the course.

529
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:42,066
<i>The dirt is supposed to be
the equalizer in this race.</i>

530
00:33:42,201 --> 00:33:44,362
<i>French rally car Raoul ÃÂaRoule</i>

531
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,563
<i>is counting on a big boost
through there.</i>

532
00:33:46,672 --> 00:33:48,605
<i>And don't forget
Lightning McQueen.</i>

533
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:50,299
<i>His mentor, the Hudson Hornet,</i>

534
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:53,037
<i>was one of the greatest
dirt track racers of all time.</i>

535
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:56,842
In my opinion, McQueen is the best
all-around racer in this competition.

536
00:33:57,016 --> 00:33:59,314
Really, Darrell, you need
to clean your windshield.

537
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:03,115
You're clearly not seeing this
for what it is: Francesco's race to lose.

538
00:34:03,256 --> 00:34:06,452
<i>It's time to find out.
The racers are locking into the grid.</i>

539
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:15,677
McQUEEN: Speed. I am speed.

540
00:34:15,713 --> 00:34:17,690
McQUEEN: Speed. I am speed.

541
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:20,201
Really? You are speed?

542
00:34:20,304 --> 00:34:23,239
Then Francesco is triple speed.

543
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,038
Francesco is triple speed.

544
00:34:27,144 --> 00:34:28,474
Ho-ho! Francesco likes-a this McQueen.

545
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,806
Ho-ho! Francesco likes-a this McQueen.

546
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:32,815
It's-a really getting him into the zone.

547
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:35,851
He is so getting beat today.

548
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:08,447
- Your suspension sets look good.
- Tire pressure is excellent!

549
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,079
- He's got plenty of fuel.
- And he's awesome.

550
00:35:10,114 --> 00:35:11,608
- He's got plenty of fuel.
- And he's awesome.

551
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:23,452
- Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed.
- It's his cover.

552
00:35:23,563 --> 00:35:26,590
One of the best I've seen, too.
Look at the detail on that rust.

553
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:28,099
It must have cost him a fortune.

554
00:35:28,202 --> 00:35:31,295
- But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
- There's probably heat on him.

555
00:35:31,405 --> 00:35:33,304
- Be patient.
- Right, of course.

556
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:36,570
- He'll signal us when he can.
- Then we find out who's behind all this.

557
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:41,148
<i>As they head into the palace
hairpin, Francesco builds an early lead.</i>

558
00:35:41,248 --> 00:35:43,739
<i>Hang on, boys.
Here comes the dirt.</i>

559
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,375
<i>Slipping and sliding, baby.</i>

560
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,110
McQueen,
it's time to make your move!

561
00:35:48,487 --> 00:35:50,614
Get on the outside
and show 'im what Doc taught you.

562
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,184
10-4, Mater.

563
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,228
<i>Oh, boy! Francesco's brought
to a screeching halt!</i>

564
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:00,561
<i>Lightning McQueen
is the first to take advantage.</i>

565
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:04,298
<i>And just like that, folks,
Francesco's lead is left in the dust.</i>

566
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,601
McQUEEN: Nice call, Mater.
Keep it up.

567
00:36:07,637 --> 00:36:08,998
McQUEEN: Nice call, Mater.
Keep it up.

568
00:36:09,108 --> 00:36:10,574
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

569
00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:13,737
<i>McQueen looks happier than a roll bar
at a demolition derby!</i>

570
00:36:15,447 --> 00:36:18,576
<i>Everyone's jostling for position
as we hit the asphalt again.</i>

571
00:36:18,684 --> 00:36:21,210
<i>Francesco lost a lot of momentum
in the dirt.</i>

572
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:30,527
<i>He's got serious work ahead of
him if he wants to get back in this race.</i>

573
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,623
<i>The racers hit the Rainbow
Bridge, with its 360-degree loop.</i>

574

<i>It is time.
- Roger that.</i>

575
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,590
<i>Oh!
Miguel Camino has blown an engine!</i>

576
00:36:59,692 --> 00:37:02,956
<i>Very unusual, Darrell.
He's been so consistent all year.</i>

577
00:37:04,697 --> 00:37:06,391
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What is it?

578
00:37:06,498 --> 00:37:08,762
- The tow truck from the bathroom.
- The bathroom?

579
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:11,028
The one the American agent
passed the device to.

580
00:37:11,204 --> 00:37:13,467
- What about him?
- He's in the pits!

581
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,300
Not for long.

582
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:19,641
- Hold on. I think I've got something.
- What is it?

583
00:37:19,746 --> 00:37:20,425
The Pacer from the party last night.

584
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,103
The Pacer from the party last night.

585
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:24,907
I'm cross-referencing with the photos
from the oil derricks.

586
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,677
Yep. His VIN numbers match.

587
00:37:26,784 --> 00:37:28,684
Anyone with him?
He won't be alone.

588
00:37:29,621 --> 00:37:32,612
Conducting analysis on the target.
He's not the only one here.

589
00:37:32,724 --> 00:37:36,523
Three, five... They're everywhere.
And they're all closing in on...

590
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:38,896
Oh, no! Finn? Finn, where are you?

591
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,623
<i>Get him out of the pits. Now!</i>

592
00:37:40,731 --> 00:37:43,530
Wow! Some of them fellers
is really loud!

593
00:37:43,668 --> 00:37:46,034
<i>Can you hear me? Over.
- What?</i>

594
00:37:46,137 --> 00:37:48,800
<i>Get out of the pit now! Do you hear me?</i>

595
00:37:48,907 --> 00:37:52,342
Hey. I know you! You're that girl
from the party last night.

596
00:37:52,476 --> 00:37:54,206
You wanna do our date now?

597
00:37:54,311 --> 00:37:57,246
Guys, too much chatter.
Let's keep this line clear.

598
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:59,282
<i>Smoke from number 10,
Clutchgoneski!</i>

599

Ha-ha-ha!

600
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:03,711
<i>There's no time for
messing about! Get out of the pits!</i>

601
00:38:03,855 --> 00:38:07,291
Is there going to be cable where you is
so I can watch the rest of the race?

602
00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:10,519
<i>You're running out of time!
- They're coming. Get him out of there!</i>

603
00:38:10,661 --> 00:38:12,925
I'm trying. Get out now.

604
00:38:13,065 --> 00:38:17,126
I usually like to have a proper detailin'
done before I meet a lady friend.

605
00:38:21,106 --> 00:38:22,072
Huh?

606
00:38:24,543 --> 00:38:27,512
- Finn McMissile! But you're dead!
- Then this shouldn't hurt.

607
00:38:40,157 --> 00:38:41,556
Miss Shiftwell?

608
00:38:41,693 --> 00:38:43,956
I've got him in the back alleys
east of the garages.

609
00:38:44,094 --> 00:38:46,393
Multiple assailants
are closing in quickly.

610
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,498
Keep him moving. I'm on my way.

611
00:38:50,835 --> 00:38:52,860
Hey, new lady friend,
you like flowers?

612
00:38:52,971 --> 00:38:53,938
What?

613
00:38:54,038 --> 00:38:56,505
No! Don't go in anywhere.
Just keep moving.

614
00:38:56,608 --> 00:38:58,576
- Stay outside. Got you.
- Outside?

615
00:38:59,777 --> 00:39:01,903
<i>Whoa! McQueen
suddenly moves to the outside.</i>

616
00:39:04,382 --> 00:39:06,077
<i>I cannot believe what I saw.</i>

617
00:39:06,184 --> 00:39:09,016
<i>That was a bonehead move
to open up the inside like that!</i>

618
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:11,018
<i>That might have cost McQueen
the victory!</i>

619
00:39:30,173 --> 00:39:32,802
This time, I'm going to make sure
you stay dead!

620
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:36,378
<i>You're doing brilliantly.
Now just stay focused.</i>

621
00:39:36,481 --> 00:39:38,949
What's that? You want me
to head toward that ruckus?

622
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,018
<i>No! Don't go down that street.</i>

623
00:39:46,356 --> 00:39:47,324
Ohh!

624
00:39:51,862 --> 00:39:52,851
Hi-yah!

625
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,360
Wow! A live karate demonstration!

626
00:39:55,465 --> 00:39:57,764
Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.

627
00:40:00,505 --> 00:40:01,869
Aaargh!

628
00:40:04,976 --> 00:40:06,739
<i>And here they come,
the two leaders.</i>

629
00:40:06,844 --> 00:40:09,141
<i>Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line!</i>

630
00:40:15,253 --> 00:40:17,380
<i>- It's close!
Francesco's the winner!</i>

631
00:40:17,487 --> 00:40:19,079
<i>McQueen's number two.</i>

632
00:40:21,425 --> 00:40:24,485
That was cool!
Can I get your autograph?

633
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:32,266
Where'd he go?

634
00:40:32,436 --> 00:40:35,371
<i>Our rendezvous has been
jeopardized. Keep the device safe.</i>

635
00:40:35,472 --> 00:40:38,840
<i>- We'll be in touch.
- Dad-gum, did I miss our date?</i>

636
00:40:44,248 --> 00:40:45,875
- Francesco!
- Francesco, over here.

637
00:40:46,016 --> 00:40:47,483
What was your strategy today?

638
00:40:47,617 --> 00:40:50,382
<i>Strategia?
Francesco needs-a no strategy.</i>

639
00:40:50,487 --> 00:40:51,614
It's-a very simple.

640
00:40:51,722 --> 00:40:55,715
You start the race, wait for Lightning
McQueen to choke, pass him, then win.

641
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,123
Francesco always-a wins. It's-a boring.

642
00:40:58,262 --> 00:41:00,492
You were in trouble
for a while.

643
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,530
That dirt track section
had you crawling.

644
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:05,378
To truly crush one's dream, you must
first raise their hopes very high.

645
00:41:05,414 --> 00:41:08,092
To truly crush one's dream, you must
first raise their hopes very high.

646
00:41:09,237 --> 00:41:12,070
- Mater!
- Hey, McQueen! What happened?

647
00:41:12,173 --> 00:41:14,199
Is the race over? You won, right?

648
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:16,675
Why were you yelling at me
while I was racing?

649
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:20,646
Yelling? Oh, you thought...
That's funny right there.

650
00:41:20,748 --> 00:41:23,047
No, that's 'cause I seen
these two fellers doing

651
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,210
some karate street performance.

652
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,753
It was nutso.
One of 'em even had a flame-thrower.

653
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:30,289
A flame-thrower?
What are you talking about?

654
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:33,155
- I don't understand. Where were you?
- Going to meet my date.

655
00:41:33,295 --> 00:41:34,818
Your date?

656
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:37,956
She started talkin' to me as a voice
in my head, tellin' me where to go.

657
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,159
- What?
- Wait a minute.

658
00:41:40,302 --> 00:41:43,896
- I didn't screw ya up, did I?
- I lost the race because of you!

659
00:41:44,005 --> 00:41:46,472
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

660
00:41:46,574 --> 00:41:49,567
An imaginary girlfriend?
Flame-throwers?

661
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,942
This is exactly why I don't bring you
along to these things.

662
00:41:53,081 --> 00:41:55,139
Maybe if I, I don't know,

663
00:41:55,282 --> 00:41:58,480
talk to somebody and explained
what happened, I could help.

664
00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:02,045
I don't need your help!
I don't want your help!

665
00:42:03,157 --> 00:42:04,954
Hey, there he is!

666
00:42:06,726 --> 00:42:09,490
- McQueen, you had it in the bag!
- Yeah! What happened?

667
00:42:09,597 --> 00:42:11,155
I made a mistake.

668
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:13,130
But I can assure you,
it won't happen again.

669
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,929
But I can assure you,
it won't happen again.

670
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:21,097
<i>Look, we know what the problem is
and we've taken care of it.</i>

671
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:26,206
<i>Lightning McQueen loses
in the last lap to Francesco Bernoulli</i>

672
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:28,778
<i>in the first race of the World Grand Prix.</i>

673
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:31,711
<i>And three - count 'em -
three cars flamed out</i>

674
00:42:31,817 --> 00:42:35,378
<i>leaving some to suggest that their fuel,
allinol, might be to blame.</i>

675
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:38,954
Allinol is safe. Alternative fuel is safe.

676
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:42,494
There is no way my fuel
caused these cars to flame out.

677
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:45,996
The jury may still be out on whether
allinol caused these accidents,

678
00:42:46,132 --> 00:42:47,393
but one thing's for sure,

679
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,000
<i>Lightning McQueen blew this race.</i>

680
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:52,695
<i>Team McQueen
can't be happy right now.</i>

681
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:05,208
<i>Welcome to
Tokyo International Airport.</i>

682
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:26,668
- Come with me, please, sir.
- But I'm 'onna miss my plane.

683
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:29,568
- Right this way.
- Ah, doggone it.

684
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,539
This is about my hook, ain't it?

685
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:34,543
I know I should have checked it,
but I can't, really.

686
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:37,079
Look. It's attached to me.

687
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:40,547
Hey, I know you. You're that feller
from the karate demonstration.

688
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:42,882
I never properly introduced myself.

689
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:45,387
Finn McMissile. British Intelligence.

690
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:48,356
Tow Mater. Average intelligence.

691
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,054
Who are you with? FBI? CIA?

692
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:54,188
Let's just say I'm AAA affiliated.

693
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,460
I know some karate.

694
00:43:56,635 --> 00:44:00,092
I don't want to brag or nuttin',
but I got me a black fan belt.

695
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:03,172
- Wanna see some moves I made up?
- You're being followed.

696
00:44:03,275 --> 00:44:06,108
This first one,
I can reach into a car's hood

697
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:08,974
pull out his battery,
and show it to him before he stalls.

698
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:13,210
I call it, "What I accidentally did
to my friend Luigi once. "

699
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,012
Hey! Hi-yah-pah!

700
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,088
- Hi-yah!
- There he is!

701
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:19,923
Hi-hi-tah! Huh!

702
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,621
Look, I probably ought to go.
I'm about to miss my flight.

703
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:25,922
- Don't worry. I've taken care of that.
- Whoa!

704
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:27,724
Hang on!

705
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,061
Whoa-hah-hah!

706
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,329
This is first-class service.

707
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:36,065
You don't even have to go
through the terminal!

708
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:39,735
Your karate partners is back there.

709
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,005
They look like
they tryin' to catch up!

710
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:44,603
Drive forward.
Whatever you do, don't stop!

711
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,514
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

712
00:44:59,331 --> 00:45:01,298
Whoa...

713
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:09,273
Is everything okay back there?

714
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,432
Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.

715
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:13,237
<i>Roger that.</i>

716
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,307
'Member that whole thing about me
not stoppin' no matter what?

717
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,954
I knew I shoulda done carry-on!

718
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,081
Thanks, old boy.

719
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:29,387
- You got it, mate.
Hey, doggonit!

720
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:31,391
Look, it's my imaginary girlfriend!

721
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:33,052
Come on! Get in here!

722
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:36,860
I tell you what, you really do
want this first date, don't ya?

723
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,992
That's a no-quit attitude right there.

724
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:40,467
What the?

725
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:45,467
- Aargh!
Hold on, Sid.

726
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,119
Aargh!

727
00:46:03,226 --> 00:46:05,286
Come on, Finn! It's now or never!

728
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,735
Hold on!

729
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:16,338
<i>By the time you read this, I will
be safely on an airplane flying home.</i>

730
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:18,237
<i>By the time you read this, I will
be safely on an airplane flying home.</i>

731
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,335
<i>I'm so sorry for what I did.</i>

732
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:23,503
McQUEEN: "I don't want to be
the cause of you losing any more races.

733
00:46:23,612 --> 00:46:27,139
"I want you to go prove to the world
what I already know.

734
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,583
"That you are the greatest race car
in the whole wide world.

735
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:33,153
"Your best friend, Mater. "

736
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:35,224
I didn't really want him to leave.

737
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:37,621
Wait, there's more here.

738
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:40,456
"PS. Please tell the hotel

739
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,791

"PPS. That's funny right there. PP."

742
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:52,168
There are a few more pages
of PS's here.

743
00:46:52,204 --> 00:46:53,563
There are a few more pages
of PS's here.

744
00:46:53,675 --> 00:46:57,202
Well, at least I know
if he's at home, he'll be safe.

745
00:46:59,414 --> 00:47:01,313
That's how I like to start the day.

746
00:47:01,416 --> 00:47:04,043
You never feel more alive
than when you're almost dead.

747
00:47:04,186 --> 00:47:06,177
Yeah.
I hope that device didn't fall off.

748
00:47:06,288 --> 00:47:07,516
Whoa!

749
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:10,250
That's the closest I ever been
to missin' my flight.

750
00:47:10,391 --> 00:47:11,237
That was... Oh!

751
00:47:11,273 --> 00:47:12,083
That was... Oh!

752
00:47:12,693 --> 00:47:15,820
- Still in one piece? Great.
I've got to go to a doctor.

753
00:47:15,996 --> 00:47:18,327
I get these sharp pains
in my undercarriage.

754
00:47:18,431 --> 00:47:21,594
- Downloading the photo now.
- Let me introduce you two.

755
00:47:21,702 --> 00:47:23,670
This here is Finn McSomethin'
or other.

756
00:47:23,804 --> 00:47:26,637
He's a first-class VIP
airport whatchamacallit.

757
00:47:27,373 --> 00:47:30,001
And, Finn, this here is my date.

758
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,771
I never did get your name.

759
00:47:31,878 --> 00:47:33,440
Oh, yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.

760
00:47:33,474 --> 00:47:35,003
Oh, yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.

761
00:47:35,112 --> 00:47:36,478
It's Shiftwell. Holley...

762
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,746
Finally.
Time to see who's behind all this.

763
00:47:41,452 --> 00:47:43,250
What is this?

764
00:47:43,387 --> 00:47:46,050
That's one of the worst engines
ever made.

765
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,503
It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas
electrical system and Whitworth bolts.

766
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:50,818
It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas
electrical system and Whitworth bolts.

767
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:54,157
Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain,
tell you what.

768
00:47:54,264 --> 00:47:56,027
Them ain't metric, they ain't inches.

769
00:47:56,132 --> 00:47:58,795
Yes, OK, but whose engine is this?

770
00:47:58,902 --> 00:48:01,427
It's kinda hard to tell from this picture,
ain't it?

771
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:03,063
- But you took it.
- Holley.

772
00:48:03,206 --> 00:48:05,175
Oh. Right! Yes, of course.

773
00:48:05,275 --> 00:48:08,369
A good agent gets what he can,
then gets out before he's killed.

774
00:48:08,478 --> 00:48:11,572
Agent? You mean, like,
insurance agent? Like...

775
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:16,016
<i>Like a good neighbor,
Mater is there!</i>

776
00:48:16,286 --> 00:48:19,278
Wait! You mean secret agents!
You guys is spies!

777
00:48:19,422 --> 00:48:22,483
In how many makes and models
did this type of engine appear?

778
00:48:22,626 --> 00:48:26,117
It was standard in seven models
over a 12-year period.

779
00:48:26,262 --> 00:48:29,630
At least 35,000 cars were made
with this engine.

780
00:48:29,733 --> 00:48:31,893
- You're purty.
- Yes, thank you.

781
00:48:32,068 --> 00:48:35,197
- And so nice.
- Just pay attention.

782
00:48:35,739 --> 00:48:37,706
This seems like a dead end.

783
00:48:38,641 --> 00:48:42,407
If there was something in the photo that
could narrow this down, I'd be happier.

784
00:48:42,512 --> 00:48:45,277
You might not be happy,
but I bet this feller is.

785
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:47,679
See how he's had most of his parts
replaced?

786
00:48:47,784 --> 00:48:49,650
And see all them boxes over there?

787
00:48:49,753 --> 00:48:52,585
Them's all original parts.
They ain't easy to come by.

788
00:48:52,755 --> 00:48:54,168
- Rare parts?
- That's something we can track.

789
00:48:54,204 --> 00:48:55,581
- Rare parts?
- That's something we can track.

790
00:48:55,858 --> 00:48:57,416
Exactly.

791
00:48:57,527 --> 00:49:00,326
Well done, Mater.
I would never have seen that.

792
00:49:00,463 --> 00:49:04,126
I know of a black-market parts dealer
in Paris, a treacherous lowlife,

793
00:49:04,268 --> 00:49:07,829
but he's the only car in the world
who can tell us whose engine this is.

794
00:49:07,938 --> 00:49:11,567
What would you say to setting up
an informal task force on this one?

795
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:12,731
Wait. What?

796
00:49:12,876 --> 00:49:15,036
You obviously have experience
in the field.

797
00:49:15,144 --> 00:49:17,375
Yeah, I live right next to one.

798
00:49:17,947 --> 00:49:19,505
I don't know.

799
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,449
I ain't exactly been much help
to anybody recently.

800
00:49:22,552 --> 00:49:24,646
You're helping me.
Please, Mater.

801
00:49:25,289 --> 00:49:26,880
Well... Okay.

802
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:29,117
But you know
I'm just a tow truck, right?

803
00:49:29,226 --> 00:49:32,490
Right. And I'm just
in the import-export business.

804
00:49:32,695 --> 00:49:34,288
- Siddeley?
- Yes, Finn?

805
00:49:34,398 --> 00:49:35,864
<i>Paris. Tout de suite.</i>

806
00:49:35,965 --> 00:49:38,525
Yeah, two of them sweets for me,
too, Sid.

807
00:49:38,635 --> 00:49:40,568
I always wanted to be a spy.

808
00:49:40,704 --> 00:49:42,295
Really? Me, too.

809
00:49:42,405 --> 00:49:45,398
- Afterburners, sir?
- Is there any other way?

810
00:50:06,028 --> 00:50:07,326
Ha ha ha!

811
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:18,005
Once we're inside, stay close.

812
00:50:18,175 --> 00:50:21,440
Don't bother checking VIN numbers.
They're all dodgy here.

813
00:50:21,577 --> 00:50:22,806
Got it.

814
00:50:22,945 --> 00:50:24,846
Don't talk to anyone,
don't look at anyone,

815
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:27,815
and absolutely, positively no idling.
Are we clear?

816
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:29,748
Yes. No idling. Yes, sir.

817
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,518
- Mater?
- Yeah, Finn?

818
00:50:32,623 --> 00:50:35,786
- We're not here to go shopping.
- Shoppin'? What do you mean?

819
00:50:35,893 --> 00:50:37,757
Why would I...

820
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,351
Dad-gum.

821
00:50:39,463 --> 00:50:42,431
<i>- Part for sales, monsieur.
- Monsieur, part for sale.</i>

822
00:50:42,565 --> 00:50:44,465
They got everything here. No!

823
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:46,967
Look at them hoods!
I could use a hood.

824
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,731
Sorry, fellers. I gotta go!

825
00:50:50,907 --> 00:50:53,672
Wow. Whoa. He-he!

826
00:50:54,311 --> 00:50:56,278
Do what?

827
00:50:57,313 --> 00:51:00,010
Excuse me. What are you selling?

828
00:51:00,184 --> 00:51:01,878
<i>Headlights, monsieur, headlights?</i>

829
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:03,748
- What in the?
- Two for one.

830
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:05,411
- I give you good price!
- I'm good!

831
00:51:10,327 --> 00:51:13,557
There you are.
- There is some great bargains here.

832
00:51:13,664 --> 00:51:15,632
<i>- Mater, get back!
- ImbÃÂ©cile!</i>

833
00:51:22,905 --> 00:51:24,237
Hey, wait for me!

834
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:42,414
Ahhhhhh!

835
00:51:47,496 --> 00:51:48,987
Ag-g-g-h!

836
00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:51,293
- Have you lost your mind?
- But I thought...

837
00:51:51,434 --> 00:51:53,425
This chap needs a tow.
Hook him up.

838
00:51:53,536 --> 00:51:55,505
Sure thing.

839
00:51:56,139 --> 00:51:59,005
You rusty piece of junk!
Get your dirty hook off me!

840
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,485
Electroshock! Are you kidding me?

841
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:13,420
This is her first field assignment. She
didn't know you were my informant.

842
00:52:13,523 --> 00:52:15,490
- Informant?
- A rookie, huh?

843
00:52:15,858 --> 00:52:17,416
I never liked new car smell.

844
00:52:18,461 --> 00:52:21,295
Tomber was doing 20-to-life
in a Moroccan impound

845
00:52:21,398 --> 00:52:24,298
the first time I saved him,
if I recall correctly.

846
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,030
Speaking of recalls, you're getting up
there in mileage, aren't you?

847
00:52:28,137 --> 00:52:31,106
All right, we get it. You both know
each other, you're both old.

848
00:52:31,275 --> 00:52:33,436
So, here you go, informant.
Inform us.

849
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:37,369
Beuck!
That is the worst motor ever made.

850
00:52:38,481 --> 00:52:41,780
Wait. That oil filter.
Those wheel bearings.

851
00:52:41,916 --> 00:52:43,942
Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?

852
00:52:44,085 --> 00:52:46,054
They should. I sold them.

853
00:52:46,155 --> 00:52:47,644
To whom?
- No idea.

854
00:52:47,757 --> 00:52:51,157
He's my best customer, but he always
does his business over the phone.

855
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:54,653
I was always wondering
why he needs so many parts.

856
00:52:54,764 --> 00:52:55,625
Now I know.

857
00:52:55,659 --> 00:52:56,487
Now I know.

858
00:52:56,597 --> 00:52:58,724
A lemon needs parts.
Ain't nothin' truer than that.

859
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:01,860
- Lemon?
- Yeah. Cars that don't ever work right.

860
00:53:01,969 --> 00:53:04,028
Lemons is a tow truck's
bread and butter.

861
00:53:04,172 --> 00:53:06,969
Like 'em Gremlins and Pacers
we run into at the party

862
00:53:07,074 --> 00:53:08,599
and the race and the airport.

863
00:53:08,742 --> 00:53:10,733
Pull up the pictures
from the oil platform.

864
00:53:10,846 --> 00:53:13,211
I want to know what other type of cars
were out there.

865
00:53:13,347 --> 00:53:17,010
Right. Let's see.
There were Hugos and Trunkovs.

866
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,813
Are these cars considered lemons?

867
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,851
Is the Popemobile Catholic?

868
00:53:20,956 --> 00:53:24,891
Everyone involved in this plot
is one of history's biggest loser cars.

869
00:53:25,025 --> 00:53:28,052
And they're all taking their orders
from the car behind this engine.

870
00:53:28,563 --> 00:53:31,054
- Ah. This explains it.
- What, Tomber?

871
00:53:31,233 --> 00:53:34,690
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo
and Trunkov never get together,

872
00:53:34,835 --> 00:53:37,396
but they are having a secret meeting
in two days.

873
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:40,634
- Where's this meeting taking place?
- Porto Corsa, Italy.

874
00:53:40,742 --> 00:53:42,402
That's where the next race is!

875
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,206
There's a good chance
our mystery engine will be there, too.

876
00:53:45,313 --> 00:53:47,280
Your chances are more than good.

877
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:50,943
I just sent him a new clutch assembly
yesterday. To Porto Corsa.

878
00:53:51,585 --> 00:53:54,612
Contact Stevenson
and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon.

879
00:53:54,722 --> 00:53:56,121
Good work.

880
00:54:00,996 --> 00:54:04,898
That three-wheeled feller
had to be right about a big meetin'.

881
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,436
You never see this many lemons
in one town.

882
00:54:09,103 --> 00:54:10,900
'Less there's a swap meet.

883
00:54:11,005 --> 00:54:12,768
How'd you get all them pictures?

884
00:54:12,873 --> 00:54:16,503
I reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light
cameras to do recognition scans.

885
00:54:17,112 --> 00:54:21,639
Wow. Not only is you the purtiest car
I ever met, but you're the smartest, too.

886
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,650
Thank you... I think.

887
00:54:23,751 --> 00:54:27,278
That's a familiar sight.
A Hugo being towed.

888
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,152
But he looks absolutely perfect!

889
00:54:29,324 --> 00:54:32,315
Of course! They must be the heads
of the lemon families.

890
00:54:32,427 --> 00:54:35,327
Makes sense. If I was rich
and broke down every day,

891
00:54:35,429 --> 00:54:37,728
I'd hire me to tow me
around all the time, too!

892
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:41,733
We've got to infiltrate that meeting
to find out who's behind all this.

893
00:54:41,835 --> 00:54:44,304
- Hang on a minute. Hold still.
- Ow!

894
00:54:50,612 --> 00:54:52,579
Ah-ha. Good job, Miss Shiftwell.

895
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:53,974
Thank you, Finn.

896
00:54:54,114 --> 00:54:55,911
Boy, I sure wish my friends
could see me now.

897
00:55:02,422 --> 00:55:04,788
LUIGl: Guido,
your eyes do not deceive you.

898
00:55:04,925 --> 00:55:07,916
We are in Italy. We are home.

899
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,193
Hey, Luigi.
Which way to the hotel, man?

900
00:55:11,364 --> 00:55:15,527
What? No friend of mine
will stay in a hotel in-a my village.

901
00:55:15,635 --> 00:55:19,400
You will stay with my...
Uncle Topolino-o-o-o!

902
00:55:19,572 --> 00:55:22,302
Luigi! Guido!

903
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:34,449
How do they do it?

904
00:55:34,588 --> 00:55:37,853
These are the same ingredients
as back home, but it tastes so good.

905
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:40,789
- It's organic, man.
- Treehugger.

906
00:55:43,829 --> 00:55:45,661
Hey, race car.

907
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:47,733
You look so down, so low.

908
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,733
Is like you have flat tires.

909
00:55:54,273 --> 00:55:56,036
She said you look like you are starving,

910
00:55:56,141 --> 00:55:58,576
that she's gonna make you a big meal
and fatten you up.

911
00:55:58,711 --> 00:55:59,871
Oh, no.

912
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,949
Mama Topolino, please,
you don't need to make a fuss.

913
00:56:03,516 --> 00:56:05,177
<i>Capisco. I understand.</i>

914
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:08,081
Is a problem, yes,
between you and a friend?

915
00:56:08,521 --> 00:56:09,646
How did you know that?

916
00:56:09,755 --> 00:56:12,918
A wise car hears one word
and understands two.

917
00:56:14,494 --> 00:56:15,518
That, and Luigi told me.

918
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,757
While Mama cooks,
come and take a stroll with me.

919
00:56:19,898 --> 00:56:22,231
I brought my friend Mater along
on the trip

920
00:56:22,335 --> 00:56:24,565
and I told him he needed
to act different,

921
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:26,195
that we weren't in Radiator Springs.

922
00:56:26,338 --> 00:56:28,306
This Mater is a close friend?

923
00:56:28,742 --> 00:56:30,471
He's my best friend.

924
00:56:30,577 --> 00:56:33,010
Then why would you ask him to be
someone else?

925
00:56:37,817 --> 00:56:39,409
What did I do?

926
00:56:39,518 --> 00:56:41,418
I said some things during our fight.

927
00:56:41,554 --> 00:56:44,579
You know, back when Guido and Luigi
used to work for me,

928
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,523
they would fight over everything.

929
00:56:48,027 --> 00:56:51,360
They fight over what Ferrari
was the best Ferrari,

930
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,327
which one of them looked
more like a Ferrari.

931
00:56:54,434 --> 00:56:56,833
There were even
some non-Ferrari fights.

932
00:56:57,804 --> 00:57:00,398
<i>So I tell them, "Va bene, it's OK to fight.</i>

933
00:57:01,007 --> 00:57:04,737
"Everybody fights now and then,
especially best friends.

934
00:57:05,644 --> 00:57:07,373
"But you got to make up fast.

935
00:57:07,547 --> 00:57:10,038
"No fight more important
than friendship. "

936
00:57:19,059 --> 00:57:23,427
- What does that mean?
- Whoever find a friend, find a treasure.

937
00:57:23,596 --> 00:57:25,530
<i>Now, mangia. Eat!</i>

938
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:39,268
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.

939
00:57:39,411 --> 00:57:41,141
Thank you, Stevenson.

940
00:57:41,246 --> 00:57:43,545
- That should just about do it.
- Perfect.

941
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:46,277
So, Mater, it's voice-activated.

942
00:57:46,418 --> 00:57:49,182
But everything's voice-activated
these days.

943
00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:52,588
What? I thought you was supposed
to be makin' me a disguise.

944
00:57:52,692 --> 00:57:55,422
<i>Voice recognized.
Disguise program initiated.</i>

945
00:57:56,061 --> 00:57:57,153
Cool!

946
00:57:57,262 --> 00:57:59,231
Computer, make me a German truck.

947
00:57:59,431 --> 00:58:02,423
<i>- Request acknowledged.
- Check it out! I'm wearing Materhosen.</i>

948
00:58:02,601 --> 00:58:03,659
Make me a monster truck!

949
00:58:03,802 --> 00:58:05,668
<i>- Request acknowledged.
- What the?</i>

950
00:58:05,804 --> 00:58:08,034
I vant to siphon your gas!

951
00:58:08,907 --> 00:58:11,172
<i>- Now make me a taco truck!
- Request acknowledged.</i>

952
00:58:13,313 --> 00:58:15,713
<i>- A funny car!
- Request acknowledged.</i>

953
00:58:18,016 --> 00:58:21,043
The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater.

954
00:58:21,153 --> 00:58:23,418
So I just go in, pretend to be this truck.

955
00:58:23,523 --> 00:58:26,286
- And leave the rest to us.
- Now, hold still.

956
00:58:26,425 --> 00:58:27,422
I have to do the final fitting
on your disguise.

957
00:58:27,456 --> 00:58:28,418
I have to do the final fitting
on your disguise.

958
00:58:32,429 --> 00:58:34,398
That's no good. Hm.

959
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:38,925
Hey. What are you doin'?

960
00:58:39,068 --> 00:58:42,902
The disguise won't calibrate effectively
without a smooth surface to graft onto.

961
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:45,907
For a second there, I thought
you was tryin' to fix my dents.

962
00:58:46,043 --> 00:58:48,409
- Yes, I was.
- Then, no, thank you.

963
00:58:48,512 --> 00:58:52,346
I don't get them dents buffed,
pulled, filled or painted by nobody.

964
00:58:52,483 --> 00:58:55,884
- They way too valuable.
- Your dents are valuable? Really?

965
00:58:55,985 --> 00:59:00,012
I come by each one of 'em with
my best friend, Lightning McQueen.

966
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:03,684
I don't fix these.
I wanna remember these dents forever.

967
00:59:03,793 --> 00:59:09,130
So, you were being serious in Paris?
McQueen isn't just part of your cover.

968
00:59:09,266 --> 00:59:12,235
Friendships can be dangerous
in our line of work, Mater.

969
00:59:12,335 --> 00:59:14,327
But my line of work
is towin' and salvage.

970
00:59:14,472 --> 00:59:17,498
Right. And Miss Shiftwell's
is designing iPhone apps.

971
00:59:17,675 --> 00:59:20,974
- No, I meant for real.
- It's OK. I'll work around the dent.

972
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:23,510
- Oh...
- In the meantime...

973
00:59:25,416 --> 00:59:27,384
<i>you look a little light on weapons.</i>

974
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,690
<i>You are looking live
at beautiful</i>

975
00:59:38,795 --> 00:59:41,128
<i>Porto Corsa, Italy,
on the Italian Riviera.</i>

976
00:59:41,231 --> 00:59:46,219
<i>What a magnificent setting for the
second race of the World Grand Prix!</i>

977
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:49,293
<i>Well Brent, they call this place
the "Gem of the Riviera,"</i>

978
00:59:49,396 --> 00:59:51,023
<i>and it's easy to see why.</i>

979
00:59:51,132 --> 00:59:53,827
<i>With its secluded beaches
and opulent casinos,</i>

980
00:59:53,934 --> 00:59:56,768
<i>Porto Corsa truly is a playground
for the wealthy.</i>

981
00:59:56,871 --> 00:59:59,101
<i>And everyone who's anyone
is here today,</i>

982
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,965
<i>from the ultra-rich and super-famous</i>

983
01:00:02,077 --> 01:00:04,443
<i>to world leaders
and important dignitaries.</i>

984
01:00:04,545 --> 01:00:06,275
<i>You aren't kidding, David.</i>

985
01:00:06,414 --> 01:00:09,679
<i>You can't do a three-point turn
without bumping into some celebrity.</i>

986
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:11,516
Welcome, everyone, to the second race
of the World Grand Prix,

987
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,213
Welcome, everyone, to the second race
of the World Grand Prix,

988
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,786
where the big news
continues to be allinol.

989
01:00:15,887 --> 01:00:18,686
Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press
earlier today

990
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:21,019
to answer questions about its safety.

991
01:00:21,126 --> 01:00:23,822
An independent panel of scientists
has determined

992
01:00:23,929 --> 01:00:25,920
that allinol is completely safe, okay?

993
01:00:26,065 --> 01:00:27,532
Safe. There it is.

994
01:00:27,699 --> 01:00:29,291
So the race will go on, folks.

995
01:00:29,434 --> 01:00:31,130
But the question everyone is asking:

996
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:33,898
Will the real
Lightning McQueen show up today?

997
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:37,032
<i>He'd better.
Talk about a home track advantage.</i>

998
01:00:37,143 --> 01:00:40,043
<i>Francesco Bernoulli
grew up racing on this course.</i>

999
01:00:40,146 --> 01:00:45,014
<i>Signore e signori, in the
pole position, Numero Uno, Francesco!</i>

1000
01:00:45,117 --> 01:00:48,244
<i>Bellissima!
Thank you for your support!</i>

1001
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:49,599
And your big mistake, McQueen!

1002
01:00:49,634 --> 01:00:50,844
And your big mistake, McQueen!

1003
01:00:50,956 --> 01:00:52,947
<i>In secondo position,</i>

1004
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:55,920
<i>numero 95, Lightning-a McQueen-a!</i>

1005
01:00:55,956 --> 01:00:58,385
<i>Numero 95, Lightning-a McQueen-a!</i>

1006
01:00:58,496 --> 01:01:00,157
McQueen-a, is-a everything OK?

1007
01:01:00,264 --> 01:01:04,063
If you're worried about your fuel, man,
don't. It's perfectly safe.

1008
01:01:04,835 --> 01:01:06,248
No, guys,
I just really wish Mater were here.

1009
01:01:06,282 --> 01:01:07,659
No, guys,
I just really wish Mater were here.

1010
01:01:07,771 --> 01:01:09,704
Francesco understands, McQueen.

1011
01:01:09,806 --> 01:01:11,739
Oh, great, here it comes.

1012
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:13,775
What do you got, Francesco?

1013
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:17,175
For famous race cars like Francesco
and, well, you,

1014
01:01:17,313 --> 01:01:20,248
to be far away from home is not easy.

1015
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:23,478
I think you forgot
the insulting part of that insult.

1016
01:01:23,586 --> 01:01:25,110
Is-a no insult.

1017
01:01:25,222 --> 01:01:28,157
When-a Francesco is away from home,
he misses his mama,

1018
01:01:28,291 --> 01:01:29,686
<i>just like-a you miss
your tow truck amico.</i>

1019
01:01:29,722 --> 01:01:31,083
<i>Just like-a you miss
your tow truck amico.</i>

1020
01:01:31,193 --> 01:01:34,184
Gee, I maybe misjudged you,
because that's exactly...

1021
01:01:34,329 --> 01:01:38,494
Of course, I am at home,
and my mama is right here.

1022
01:01:38,601 --> 01:01:40,465
Mama!

1023
01:01:40,568 --> 01:01:44,596
Don't worry, Mama,
McQueen is very sad.

1024
01:01:44,773 --> 01:01:47,139
I will beat his cry-baby bottom today!

1025
01:01:47,242 --> 01:01:50,235
And there's the insult we were missing.

1026
01:02:07,461 --> 01:02:09,896
<i>Darrell, the racers
are settling in as they head</i>

1027
01:02:09,996 --> 01:02:11,293
<i>to the Italian countryside.</i>

1028
01:02:11,398 --> 01:02:13,333
<i>Whoo, boy!</i>

1029
01:02:13,434 --> 01:02:15,958
<i>This is gonna be a great race.</i>

1030
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:31,184
Gremlins.
Man, those are some ugly cars.

1031
01:02:31,284 --> 01:02:33,344
Look like someone stole their trunks.

1032
01:02:38,259 --> 01:02:40,556
My grand-a father has-a broken down.

1033
01:02:40,661 --> 01:02:44,460
If-a one of-a you would help,
I would be so thankful.

1034
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:47,590
Sounds like you need
some roadside assistance.

1035
01:02:47,702 --> 01:02:49,931
- She was talking to me.
- Really? Prove it.

1036
01:02:50,036 --> 01:02:51,971
Don't-a fight over me.

1037
01:02:52,072 --> 01:02:54,940
<i>Signore Tow Truck, per favore.</i>

1038
01:02:55,041 --> 01:02:57,943
Get ready, Mater.
You're on any moment now.

1039
01:02:59,447 --> 01:03:02,177
I don't know about this.
What if I screw things up?

1040
01:03:02,282 --> 01:03:03,806
<i>Impossible.</i>

1041
01:03:03,918 --> 01:03:05,943
<i>Just apply the same level of dedication</i>

1042
01:03:06,052 --> 01:03:09,489
<i>you've been using to play
the idiot tow truck, and you'll be fine.</i>

1043
01:03:09,623 --> 01:03:13,889
It's just that them guys look purty tough
and... Wait, did you say "idiot"?

1044
01:03:14,027 --> 01:03:17,019
<i>- Is that how you see me?
That's how everyone sees you.</i>

1045
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,563
<i>Isn't that the idea?</i>

1046
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:20,599
<i>I tell you, that's the genius of it.</i>

1047
01:03:20,701 --> 01:03:22,692
<i>No one realizes they're being fooled</i>

1048
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:25,429
<i>because they're too busy laughing
at the fool.</i>

1049
01:03:25,539 --> 01:03:27,030
<i>Brilliant!</i>

1050
01:03:30,143 --> 01:03:32,237
- Why aren't you in disguise?
- I er...

1051
01:03:32,346 --> 01:03:35,179
- Come on! There's no time! Go!
- OK. OK.

1052

<i>- Computer, disguise!

01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,324
Ivan.

1055
01:03:54,335 --> 01:03:55,927
Oh, er...

1056
01:03:56,070 --> 01:04:00,507
Ivan, why do you insult me so
by making me wait here?

1057
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:10,315
He's in.

1058
01:04:12,887 --> 01:04:15,514
<i>The racers are now

1060

No more bets, please.

1061
01:04:36,476 --> 01:04:37,967
Come on, fuzzy dice!

1062
01:04:38,112 --> 01:04:40,045
- Number four. Easy four.
- Yeah!

1063
01:04:40,146 --> 01:04:42,081
Air freshener. Antenna balls.

1064
01:04:42,182 --> 01:04:43,945
Spark-a plugs.

1065
01:04:44,085 --> 01:04:46,451
This place looks like
it's made outta gold!

1066
01:04:46,554 --> 01:04:49,784
<i>That's because it is.
Now, be careful what you say.</i>

1067
01:04:49,956 --> 01:04:51,891
Why is that?

1068
01:04:51,992 --> 01:04:53,927
What do you mean, "Don't talk to ya"?

1069
01:04:54,027 --> 01:04:56,393
You want me to stop talkin' to ya
right now?

1070
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:57,929
You are acting strange today, Ivan.

1071
01:04:59,298 --> 01:05:02,132
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

1072
01:05:02,235 --> 01:05:05,467
"Alexander Hugo, aka Chop Shop Alex. "

1073
01:05:05,572 --> 01:05:07,505
You got a lot of aka's, Alex.

1074
01:05:07,608 --> 01:05:11,601
But that makes sense, seein's how
you's wanted in France, Germany...

1075
01:05:11,744 --> 01:05:12,708
Mater, stop it!

1076
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,670
Mater, stop it!

1077
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,110
OK, OK, keep your voice down!

1078
01:05:15,213 --> 01:05:17,148
You gonna make me arrested!

1079
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:19,740
Don't mess with Ivan today.
He's in a bad mood.

1080
01:05:19,851 --> 01:05:21,547
He's so good!

1081
01:05:23,121 --> 01:05:23,983
Victor!

1082
01:05:24,018 --> 01:05:24,847
Victor!

1083
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:26,458
Hey, Victor!

1084
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,327
- There you are!
- Come in!

1085
01:05:29,427 --> 01:05:33,557
Victor Hugo, I'm J Curby Gremlin.
From Detroit.

1086
01:05:33,666 --> 01:05:35,394
It's good to see you.

1087
01:05:35,534 --> 01:05:37,365
Is the big boss here yet?

1088
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:40,563
- No, not yet.
- He's supposed to be here any minute.

1089
01:05:44,476 --> 01:05:46,445
Here we go.

1090
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:50,146
<i>Guten Tag.</i>

1091
01:05:50,248 --> 01:05:52,217
It's just the professor.

1092
01:05:52,351 --> 01:05:53,943
ZÃÂ¼ndapp! When is he coming?

1093
01:05:54,052 --> 01:05:56,021
He's already here.

1094
01:05:57,989 --> 01:06:00,257
<i>Welcome, everyone.</i>

1095
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:00,347
<i>Welcome, everyone.</i>

1096
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:03,655
<i>I wish I could be with you
on this very special day,</i>

1097
01:06:03,795 --> 01:06:05,786
<i>but my clutch assembly broke.</i>

1098
01:06:05,896 --> 01:06:07,989
<i>- You know how it is.
- Forget about it.</i>

1099
01:06:08,099 --> 01:06:09,726
We know how you feel.

1100
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:11,994
- Descramble that voice.
- I'm trying.

1101
01:06:12,103 --> 01:06:14,195
Oh, it's too sophisticated.

1102
01:06:14,306 --> 01:06:16,273
<i>We are here to celebrate.</i>

1103
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,809
<i>Today, all your hard work pays off.</i>

1104
01:06:19,911 --> 01:06:22,606
<i>The world turned their backs
on cars like us.</i>

1105
01:06:22,713 --> 01:06:26,150
<i>They stopped manufacturing us,
stopped making our parts.</i>

1106
01:06:26,251 --> 01:06:30,688
<i>The only thing they haven't stopped
doing is laughing at us.</i>

1107
01:06:31,456 --> 01:06:35,755
<i>They've called us terrible names:
Jalopy, rust bucket, heap,</i>

1108
01:06:36,327 --> 01:06:40,025
<i>clunker, junker, beater,
wreck, rattletrap,</i>

1109
01:06:41,398 --> 01:06:42,661
<i>lemon.</i>

1110
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,065
<i>But their insults just give us strength.</i>

1111
01:06:46,436 --> 01:06:51,396
<i>Because today, my friends,
that all ends!</i>

1112
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:54,668
<i>There's smoke
on the casino bridge!</i>

1113
01:06:54,811 --> 01:06:55,800
Oh, no!

1114
01:06:55,913 --> 01:06:57,471
It's Carla Veloso, the Brazilian race car!

1115
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,385
- What just happened?
- I'm working on it.

1116
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:08,387
<i>They laughed at us,
but now it's our turn to laugh back.</i>

1117
01:07:08,422 --> 01:07:10,219
<i>They laughed at us,
but now it's our turn to laugh back.</i>

1118
01:07:12,494 --> 01:07:15,487
<i>Another crash!
It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley.</i>

1119
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:17,860
<i>Embrace your inner lemon.</i>

1120
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,594
<i>Let it drive you.</i>

1121
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:23,103
I'm detecting an extremely strong
electromagnetic pulse.

1122
01:07:27,077 --> 01:07:28,907
- Finn, it's the camera.
- Where?

1123
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:30,807
On the tower!

1124
01:07:33,248 --> 01:07:37,275
<i>This was meant to
be alternative fuel's greatest moment.</i>

1125
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:41,221
<i>But after today,
everyone will race back to gasoline.</i>

1126
01:07:41,324 --> 01:07:43,804
<i>And we, the owners of the world's
largest untapped oil reserve</i>

1127
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:46,284
<i>And we, the owners of the world's
largest untapped oil reserve</i>

1128
01:07:46,394 --> 01:07:48,590
<i>will become the most powerful cars
in the world!</i>

1129
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:50,621
Get out of the way!

1130
01:08:25,867 --> 01:08:27,948
<i>They will come to us, and they will have
no choice, because they will need us.</i>

1131
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:30,032
<i>They will come to us, and they will have
no choice, because they will need us.</i>

1132
01:08:37,244 --> 01:08:38,576
Huh? Whoa!

1133
01:08:39,447 --> 01:08:41,414
We figured you might stop by!

1134
01:08:44,185 --> 01:08:46,779
<i>And they will finally respect us!</i>

1135
01:08:46,921 --> 01:08:48,890
<i>So hold your hoods high!</i>

1136
01:08:49,224 --> 01:08:52,216
<i>After today, you will never again
be ashamed of who you are!</i>

1137
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:54,506
No!

1138
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:55,351
No!

1139
01:08:55,462 --> 01:08:56,890
<i>Long live lemons!</i>

1140
01:08:56,926 --> 01:08:58,320
<i>Long live lemons!</i>

1141
01:08:58,431 --> 01:09:00,764
<i>Number 7 is loose!
Shu Todoroki!</i>

1142
01:09:24,757 --> 01:09:25,985
Finn?

1143
01:09:26,859 --> 01:09:29,420
<i>Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line!</i>

1144
01:09:29,563 --> 01:09:31,462
<i>McQueen's the winner!
Francesco's second!</i>

1145
01:09:31,564 --> 01:09:32,778
<i>They have no idea
what happened behind them.</i>

1146
01:09:32,813 --> 01:09:33,992
<i>They have no idea
what happened behind them.</i>

1147
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,567
This is impossible!

1148
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:37,568
That's what I'm talking about! Ka-chow!

1149
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:39,432
What happened?

1150
01:09:39,572 --> 01:09:42,234
- Where are all the other cars?
- What is going on?

1151
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:44,234
Oh, no!

1152
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:53,845
<i>Sir Axlerod, is the final race in London
still going to take place?</i>

1153
01:09:53,987 --> 01:09:55,886
<i>I suppose that...</i>

1154
01:09:56,021 --> 01:09:59,252
<i>The show must go on,
as they say.</i>

1155
01:09:59,391 --> 01:10:01,417
I can't believe this is really happening!

1156
01:10:01,527 --> 01:10:02,618
Quiet!

1157
01:10:02,729 --> 01:10:05,788
<i>Will you require all the racers
to still run on allinol?</i>

1158
01:10:05,899 --> 01:10:10,699
<i>I cannot, in good conscience, continue
to risk the lives of any more race cars.</i>

1159
01:10:11,337 --> 01:10:13,233
<i>The final race will not be run on allinol.</i>

1160
01:10:13,268 --> 01:10:15,130
<i>The final race will not be run on allinol.</i>

1161
01:10:15,239 --> 01:10:17,902
<i>There you have it, a clearly devastated
Sir Miles Axlerod</i>

1162
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:22,105
<i>announcing that he will not require
the cars to use allinol for the final race.</i>

1163
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,578
A toast!

1164
01:10:23,681 --> 01:10:27,310
To the death of allinol
and alternative fuel forever!

1165
01:10:27,453 --> 01:10:30,286
Mater, abort the mission.

1166
01:10:30,421 --> 01:10:33,788
They've got Finn. Get out of there.
Get out of there right now.

1167
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,255
How is your grandfather?

1168
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,295
Long live lemons!

1169
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:40,728
Isn't this a great party, Ivan, huh?

1170
01:10:40,865 --> 01:10:42,628
Oh, yeah, it's unbelievable.

1171
01:10:42,734 --> 01:10:44,792
You are not leaving, are you?

1172
01:10:44,903 --> 01:10:46,837
Uh... of course I ain't leaving.

1173
01:10:46,939 --> 01:10:47,801
<i>- McQUEEN ON TV: I'm just in shock...
- McQueen?</i>

1174
01:10:47,836 --> 01:10:48,663
<i>- McQUEEN ON TV: I'm just in shock...
- McQueen?</i>

1175
01:10:49,539 --> 01:10:51,474
<i>Crashes are a part of racing, I know,</i>

1176
01:10:51,576 --> 01:10:53,171
<i>but something like that
should never happen.</i>

1177
01:10:53,206 --> 01:10:54,766
<i>But something like that
should never happen.</i>

1178
01:10:54,877 --> 01:10:58,369
<i>You can choose your fuel
for the final race. What it'll be?</i>

1179
01:10:58,481 --> 01:10:59,948
<i>Allinol.</i>

1180
01:11:00,082 --> 01:11:01,310
<i>After today?</i>

1181
01:11:01,451 --> 01:11:04,351
<i>My friend Fillmore says it's safe.
That's good enough for me.</i>

1182
01:11:04,488 --> 01:11:06,854
<i>I didn't stand by a friend of mine
recently.</i>

1183
01:11:06,957 --> 01:11:09,118
<i>I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.</i>

1184
01:11:09,292 --> 01:11:12,158
<i>So a surprising revelation
from Lightning McQueen.</i>

1185
01:11:12,328 --> 01:11:15,923
<i>He will use allinol in the final race,
despite what occurred today.</i>

1186
01:11:16,065 --> 01:11:18,728
<i>till Lightning McQueen is dead.
- Of course.</i>

1187
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:22,932
Allinol must be finished for good.

1188
01:11:23,606 --> 01:11:25,972
McQueen cannot win the last race.

1189
01:11:26,743 --> 01:11:28,972
Lightning McQueen must be killed!

1190
01:11:29,112 --> 01:11:30,340
No!

1191
01:11:37,487 --> 01:11:39,351
It's the American spy!

1192
01:11:40,823 --> 01:11:41,916
Dad-gum!

Whoa!

01:12:12,389 --> 01:12:13,377
McQueen!

1200
01:12:17,993 --> 01:12:19,051
Whoa! What's this?

1201
01:12:19,429 --> 01:12:20,487
Whoa!

1202
01:12:24,734 --> 01:12:26,429
McQueen! McQueen!

1203
01:12:29,538 --> 01:12:30,506
Waagh!

1204
01:12:33,076 --> 01:12:34,907
Let me through! Let me through!

1205
01:12:35,043 --> 01:12:37,409
Let me in!
I got to get through to warn McQueen!

1206
01:12:37,512 --> 01:12:39,447
You cannot-a come through here!
Back up.

1207
01:12:39,614 --> 01:12:41,014
We have a lunatic at gate 9.

1208
01:12:41,117 --> 01:12:44,882
I was disguised as a tow truck
to infiltrate this lemonhead meeting

1209
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:48,012
and my weapons system's done
misinterperated what I'm saying!

1210
01:12:48,123 --> 01:12:50,786
- Lunatic at gate 9.
- McQueen! McQueen!

1211
01:12:50,893 --> 01:12:53,054
<i>- You are the champion!

McQueen!

1213
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:57,631
McQueen.
- Give us a pose!

1214
01:12:57,734 --> 01:13:00,032
- McQueen!
- Stop moving. Stop!

1215
01:13:00,136 --> 01:13:01,280
Where you going?

1216
01:13:01,315 --> 01:13:02,426
Where you going?

1217
01:13:02,537 --> 01:13:03,503
Stop!

1218
01:13:03,771 --> 01:13:06,137
- McQueen!
- That really sounded like...

1219
01:13:06,274 --> 01:13:07,434
Mater!

1220
01:13:07,542 --> 01:13:09,065
<i>- Mater?
- Signore?</i>

1221
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:11,235
McQueen!
They're gonna kill you!

1222
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,711
McQUEEN: Mater!

1223
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:14,109
Excuse me.

1224
01:13:14,248 --> 01:13:16,011
No, where are you going?

1225
01:13:16,117 --> 01:13:17,845
<i>Scusi. Mater!</i>

1226
01:13:17,952 --> 01:13:19,475
<i>- McQueen!
- Scusi.</i>

1227
01:13:19,654 --> 01:13:22,054
Mater! Mater!

1228
01:13:22,157 --> 01:13:24,091
Mater, I'm so glad to see you.

1229
01:13:24,192 --> 01:13:27,252
Lightning McQueen!
I am a huge fan.

1230
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:28,953
I'm sorry, I thought I heard...

1231
01:13:29,096 --> 01:13:33,055
That was me. I said, "You killed
out there today. You're the best. "

1232
01:13:33,167 --> 01:13:35,898
<i>- What? I mean, thanks.
- Right this way, signore.</i>

1233
01:13:36,003 --> 01:13:37,971
I really thought I heard my friend.

1234
01:13:39,807 --> 01:13:43,140
In England, you'll be finished!
At the finish line.

1235
01:13:44,212 --> 01:13:46,475
- Wait, what?
- The press is waiting.

1236
01:13:46,581 --> 01:13:48,070
Come-a with me, please.

1237
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:53,650
Let me go!

1238
01:13:53,755 --> 01:13:55,847
You actually care about that race car.

1239
01:13:56,356 --> 01:13:58,324
A pity you didn't warn him in time.

1240
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:08,067
<i>"Idiot"?
Is that how you see me?</i>

1241
01:14:08,168 --> 01:14:11,194
<i>That's how everyone sees you.
I tell you, that's the genius of it.</i>

1242
01:14:11,338 --> 01:14:13,329
<i>No one realizes they're being fooled</i>

1243
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,171
<i>because they're too busy laughing
at the fool.</i>

1244
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:18,279
<i>At the fool...</i>

1245
01:14:18,779 --> 01:14:20,542
Excuse me!

1246
01:14:20,715 --> 01:14:22,579
<i>Domo arigato!</i>

1247
01:14:22,684 --> 01:14:23,345
Yeah!

1248
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,006
Yeah!

1249
01:14:26,386 --> 01:14:28,182
You done good. You got all the leaves.

1250
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,788
- Check out that tow truck.
- I wonder who that guy's with.

1251
01:14:30,923 --> 01:14:32,420
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

1252
01:14:32,454 --> 01:14:33,917
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

1253
01:14:34,326 --> 01:14:36,555
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

1254
01:14:39,965 --> 01:14:41,363
Aargh!

1255
01:14:43,167 --> 01:14:46,399
Somebody get me water!
Oh, sweet relief.

1256
01:14:46,537 --> 01:14:47,835
Mater!

1257
01:14:52,778 --> 01:14:54,609
But I never leak oil. Never.

1258
01:14:54,712 --> 01:14:55,908
Get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

1259
01:14:55,944 --> 01:14:57,105
Get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

1260
01:14:57,414 --> 01:14:59,576
Wait a minute.
I didn't screw you up, did I?

1261
01:14:59,751 --> 01:15:02,985
- I lost the race because of you!
- Maybe if I talked to somebody...

1262
01:15:03,086 --> 01:15:04,747
I don't need your help!

1263
01:15:04,854 --> 01:15:06,787
I don't want your help.

1264
01:15:06,889 --> 01:15:08,856
Your help...

1265
01:15:09,492 --> 01:15:11,426
Bang the gong. Get it on!

1266
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,586
<i>McQUEEN: Listen,
this isn't Radiator Springs.</i>

1267
01:15:13,762 --> 01:15:17,028
This is exactly why I don't bring
you along to these things!

1268
01:15:28,011 --> 01:15:30,604
Holley! Finn! Where are we?

1269
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:33,976
We're in London, Mater,
inside Big Bentley.

1270
01:15:39,654 --> 01:15:41,384
Whoa!

1271
01:15:41,657 --> 01:15:42,783
Whoa!

1272
01:15:50,065 --> 01:15:52,000
Oh, this... This is all my fault.

1273
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,034
Don't be a fool, Mater.

1274
01:15:54,136 --> 01:15:56,070
But I am, remember? You said so.

1275
01:15:56,204 --> 01:15:58,104
When did I... Oh.

1276
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:02,199
Mater, I was complimenting you
on what a good spy you are.

1277
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:04,108
I'm not a spy!

1278
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:09,649
I've been trying to tell you that
the whole time.

1279
01:16:09,819 --> 01:16:11,877
I really am just a tow truck.

1280
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:13,851
Finn, he's not joking.

1281
01:16:13,956 --> 01:16:17,823
- I know.
- You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.

1282
01:16:17,926 --> 01:16:21,260
And what's happened to McQueen
is 'cause I'm such a big one.

1283
01:16:22,064 --> 01:16:24,033
This is all my fault.

1284
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:29,899
- Good. You're up.
- And just in time.

1285
01:16:30,038 --> 01:16:32,667
Professor Z wanted you
to have a front-row seat,

1286
01:16:32,841 --> 01:16:34,707
for the death of Lightning McQueen.

1287
01:16:34,877 --> 01:16:37,903
- He's still alive?
- Not for much longer.

1288
01:16:42,417 --> 01:16:43,385
Whoa!

1289
01:16:43,886 --> 01:16:44,944
Huh?

1290
01:16:50,859 --> 01:16:53,725
- We came as soon as you called.
- I called to talk to Mater.

1291
01:16:53,895 --> 01:16:56,090
It never occurred to me
he wouldn't be there.

1292
01:16:56,197 --> 01:16:58,289
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard now.

1293
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:01,368
And Sarge is in touch with his friends
in the British military.

1294
01:17:01,502 --> 01:17:03,130
You just need
to focus on the race.

1295
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:05,831
I know but, Sally with everything
going on, I'm not sure...

1296
01:17:07,074 --> 01:17:09,372
- Sir Axlerod.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

1297
01:17:09,511 --> 01:17:12,639
- It's all right.
- I just wanted to personally thank you.

1298
01:17:12,747 --> 01:17:17,684
Because after Italy, I was finished,
and then you gave me one last shot.

1299
01:17:17,786 --> 01:17:18,774
Listen...

1300
01:17:18,886 --> 01:17:22,253
I probably shouldn't be saying this,
but I hope you win today.

1301
01:17:22,356 --> 01:17:25,587
You show the world
that they've been wrong about allinol.

1302
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,523
Mater would want you to race.

1303
01:17:27,557 --> 01:17:28,685
Mater would want you to race.

1304
01:17:29,529 --> 01:17:31,462
All right. For Mater.

1305
01:18:05,798 --> 01:18:07,231
Here he comes.

1306
01:18:25,351 --> 01:18:27,546
<i>What happened?
- I don't know, Professor.</i>

1307
01:18:27,654 --> 01:18:29,780
- What did you do?
- I didn't do nothing.

1308
01:18:29,956 --> 01:18:33,050
Ssh, I'm talking to the Professor.
What's that, Professor?

1309
01:18:33,193 --> 01:18:34,659
- You broke it!
- Quiet!

1310
01:18:34,795 --> 01:18:37,161
- I understand, sir. Yes.
- What did he say?

1311
01:18:37,264 --> 01:18:40,164
- We go to the back-up plan.
- Back-up plan?

1312
01:18:40,266 --> 01:18:42,234
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit.

1313
01:18:42,601 --> 01:18:45,969
The next time he makes a stop,
instead of saying "ka-chow"...

1314
01:18:46,073 --> 01:18:48,041
he's going to go "ka-boom"!

1315
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:52,444
Don't feel bad, tow truck.
You couldn't have saved him.

1316
01:18:52,578 --> 01:18:54,739
Oh, wait, you could have!

1317
01:18:54,847 --> 01:18:57,247
<i>- Dad-gum lemons!
Request acknowledged.</i>

1318
01:18:57,984 --> 01:19:00,475
What?
You didn't think we'd take your bullets?

1319
01:19:03,724 --> 01:19:05,817
That's right! You got nothing!

1320
01:19:06,893 --> 01:19:08,827
Who's the lemon now, huh?

1321
01:19:11,797 --> 01:19:13,390
Nice try, Mater.

1322
01:19:14,201 --> 01:19:17,601
<i>- Dad-gum... Dad-gum... Dad-gum.
- Request... Request... Request...</i>

1323
01:19:18,404 --> 01:19:19,837
Mater!

1324
01:19:25,078 --> 01:19:26,806
I got to get y'all out of there.

1325
01:19:26,912 --> 01:19:29,279
There's no time.
McQueen needs your help.

1326
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:31,680
But I can't. I'm just a tow truck.

1327
01:19:31,818 --> 01:19:34,217
It's up to you.
Go to the pits and get everyone out.

1328
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,811
- You can do that.
- What about you guys?

1329
01:19:36,922 --> 01:19:40,323
- We'll be OK.
- Go and get some more dents, Mater.

1330
01:19:49,069 --> 01:19:51,002
So, we'll be OK? Really?

1331
01:19:51,104 --> 01:19:53,663
He wouldn't have left
if I'd told him the truth.

1332
01:19:53,774 --> 01:19:55,139
Argh!

1333
01:19:55,274 --> 01:19:56,832
Being killed by a clock.

1334
01:19:56,943 --> 01:19:59,672
Gives a whole new meaning to
"Your time has come. "

1335
01:19:59,779 --> 01:20:01,747
Time? That's it!

1336
01:20:09,922 --> 01:20:12,551
- What are you doing?
- Trying to turn back time.

1337
01:20:16,095 --> 01:20:19,122
If I can just reverse the polarity.

1338
01:20:22,802 --> 01:20:24,737
Good job. Quick thinking, Holley.

1339
01:20:31,811 --> 01:20:34,679
What's everybody
on the wrong side of the road for?

1340
01:20:36,716 --> 01:20:38,444
Oh, no!

1341
01:20:38,551 --> 01:20:40,520
Drive! Burn rubber!

1342
01:20:47,293 --> 01:20:49,261
We've got to get to the course.

1343
01:20:49,996 --> 01:20:52,088
Calculate the fastest way to...

1344
01:20:53,632 --> 01:20:54,657
Done.

1345
01:20:54,768 --> 01:20:56,462
Oh. Miss Shiftwell.

1346
01:20:56,569 --> 01:21:00,301
- They're standard issue now.
- You kids get all the good hardware.

1347
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,654
Oh, no, that's Mater's.

1348
01:21:03,689 --> 01:21:05,067
Oh, no, that's Mater's.

1349
01:21:05,176 --> 01:21:06,144
I knew his escape was too easy.

1350
01:21:16,921 --> 01:21:18,319
Come back here! Stop!

1351
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:23,371
- Mater?
- Everybody, get out now!

1352
01:21:23,405 --> 01:21:24,681
- Mater?
- Everybody, get out now!

1353
01:21:24,793 --> 01:21:26,256
Y'all get out of the pits.
What are you guys doing here?

1354
01:21:26,291 --> 01:21:27,719
Y'all get out of the pits.
What are you guys doing here?

1355
01:21:27,829 --> 01:21:30,094
- We're here because of you, Mater.
- Is everything OK?

1356
01:21:30,198 --> 01:21:32,792
No, everything's not OK.
There's a bomb in here.

1357
01:21:32,935 --> 01:21:34,835
- Y'all got to get out. Now.
- A bomb?

1358
01:21:36,471 --> 01:21:38,539
<i>Mater.
- Finn! You're OK.</i>

1359
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:40,537
Listen to me. The bomb is on you!
They knew you'd try to help McQueen.

1360
01:21:40,573 --> 01:21:42,436
Listen to me. The bomb is on you!
They knew you'd try to help McQueen.

1361
01:21:42,609 --> 01:21:45,975
<i>When we were knocked out,
they planted it in your air filter.</i>

1362
01:21:48,414 --> 01:21:50,975
- Uh-oh.
- Mater! There you are!

1363
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:53,948
Stop right there!
- I've been so worried about you.

1364
01:21:54,054 --> 01:21:55,715
Don't come any closer!
McQUEEN: Are you OK?

1365
01:21:55,823 --> 01:21:57,791
No, I'm not OK! Stay away from me!

1366
01:21:58,591 --> 01:21:59,990
McQUEEN: No, wait! Wait!

1367
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:03,960
<i>A tow truck has just raced
onto the track, driving backwards!</i>

1368
01:22:04,664 --> 01:22:05,756
Mater, wait!

1369
01:22:07,132 --> 01:22:09,966
Normally an emergency vehicle on the
track means there's been an accident.

1370
01:22:10,069 --> 01:22:12,731
<i>- Lightning McQueen is chasing him!
- Mater, wait!</i>

1371
01:22:12,838 --> 01:22:16,604
Stay back! If you get close to me,
you're going to get hurt real bad!

1372
01:22:16,775 --> 01:22:20,609
McQUEEN: I know I made you feel that
way before, but none of that matters!

1373
01:22:20,712 --> 01:22:22,203
We're best friends!

1374
01:22:24,216 --> 01:22:25,877
<i>And McQueen
seems to be having</i>

1375
01:22:25,984 --> 01:22:27,782
<i>a conversation with the tow truck.</i>

1376
01:22:27,886 --> 01:22:30,582
<i>I don't know who
that truck is, Brent, but tell you what,</i>

1377
01:22:30,689 --> 01:22:33,021
<i>he's got to be the world's best
backwards driver.</i>

1378
01:22:33,993 --> 01:22:36,962
McQueen, you don't get it!
I'm the bomb!

1379
01:22:37,063 --> 01:22:40,590
Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
That's what I'm trying to say here!

1380
01:22:40,699 --> 01:22:44,158
You've always been the bomb
and you'll always be the bomb.

1381
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:46,703
- Stay away!
- No! Never!

1382
01:22:49,007 --> 01:22:50,565
Almost there.

1383
01:22:50,676 --> 01:22:54,443
I'm not letting you get away again!

1384
01:22:55,247 --> 01:22:58,444
<i>- Got to keep away from McQueen!
Request acknowledged.</i>

1385
01:22:58,551 --> 01:23:00,381
Oh, my gosh.

1386
01:23:13,465 --> 01:23:15,432
What is happening? It's a bad dream!

1387
01:23:16,967 --> 01:23:19,435
<i>And Lightning McQueen
just blasted away,</i>

1388
01:23:19,537 --> 01:23:21,938
<i>hooked to the now rocket-propelled
tow truck.</i>

1389
01:23:24,141 --> 01:23:25,472
Gargh!

1390
01:23:30,114 --> 01:23:30,993
Aagh!

1391
01:23:31,028 --> 01:23:31,871
Aagh!

1392
01:23:35,717 --> 01:23:37,242
The Professor's on the run!

1393
01:23:37,353 --> 01:23:39,877
- Someone's got to get McQueen.
- Get McQueen!

1394
01:23:41,356 --> 01:23:44,019
- Holley, I'll get ZÃÂ¼ndapp. Help Mater.
- Got it!

1395
01:23:47,863 --> 01:23:49,832
What is happening?

1396
01:24:03,912 --> 01:24:05,311
Hurry, Professor.

1397
01:24:17,092 --> 01:24:19,890
You really think I'm going to let you
float away, Professor?

1398
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:49,390
- McQueen, let go!
- Never!

1399
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:53,953
- They're coming your way.
- Let's go!

1400
01:25:02,137 --> 01:25:03,502
Give it up, McMissile.

1401
01:25:19,855 --> 01:25:23,314
Mater, stop!
- No way! You could get hurt.

1402
01:25:29,265 --> 01:25:30,595
Oh, no.

1403
01:25:51,887 --> 01:25:53,265
Mater, we've got to get
that bomb off you.

1404
01:25:53,301 --> 01:25:54,645
Mater, we've got to get
that bomb off you.

1405
01:25:54,756 --> 01:25:55,722
Bomb?

1406
01:25:55,823 --> 01:25:57,792
Yeah, they strapped it to me
to kill you as a back-up plan.

1407
01:25:57,891 --> 01:25:59,387
Back-up plan?
Mater, who put a bomb on you?

1408
01:25:59,422 --> 01:26:00,885
Back-up plan?
Mater, who put a bomb on you?

1409
01:26:01,729 --> 01:26:04,197
You! Why didn't my death ray kill you?

1410
01:26:04,298 --> 01:26:05,595
Death ray?

1411
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:06,997
Turn off the bomb, ZÃÂ¼ndapp!

1412
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,591
Are you all so dense?
It's voice-activated.

1413
01:26:09,703 --> 01:26:11,796
Everything is voice-activated
these days.

1414
01:26:11,905 --> 01:26:13,069
Deactivate! Deactivate!

1415
01:26:13,104 --> 01:26:14,234
Deactivate! Deactivate!

1416
01:26:14,341 --> 01:26:15,967
<i>Voice denied.</i>

1417
01:26:17,744 --> 01:26:19,234
- Huh!
- Oops.

1418
01:26:19,412 --> 01:26:21,846
Did I forget to mention
that it can only be disarmed

1419
01:26:21,948 --> 01:26:23,644
by the one who activated it?

1420
01:26:23,984 --> 01:26:25,884
- Say it.
- Deactivate.

1421
01:26:26,886 --> 01:26:28,319
<i>Voice denied.</i>

1422
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:34,818
I'm not the one who activated it.
Would anyone else like to try?

1423
01:26:35,761 --> 01:26:38,060
- You read my mind.
- He was getting on my nerves.

1424
01:26:38,163 --> 01:26:41,690
- What do we do?
- It's very simple. You blow up.

1425
01:26:42,135 --> 01:26:45,865
I'm going out on a limb here. These are
the guys that want me dead, correct?

1426
01:26:45,971 --> 01:26:48,439
- It's nothing personal.
- Fellers, listen.

1427
01:26:48,542 --> 01:26:52,501
I know what you're going through.
Everybody's been laughing at me too.

1428
01:26:53,747 --> 01:26:56,875
But becoming powerful and rich
beyond your wildest dreams

1429
01:26:56,983 --> 01:26:59,417
ain't gonna make you feel better.

1430
01:27:00,287 --> 01:27:02,255
Yeah, but it's worth a shot.

1431
01:27:11,597 --> 01:27:12,724
Pit stop.

1432
01:27:17,002 --> 01:27:18,970
Not today, boys.

1433
01:27:28,614 --> 01:27:29,582
Retreat!

1434
01:27:32,551 --> 01:27:34,247
Thanks for the help, Corporal.

1435
01:27:34,354 --> 01:27:36,685
Anything for one of Pop's mates.

1436
01:27:42,828 --> 01:27:44,762
What's he saying? What's wrong?

1437
01:27:44,898 --> 01:27:46,865
None of his wrenches fit the bolts.

1438
01:27:49,202 --> 01:27:51,136
I get it. I get it!

1439
01:27:51,237 --> 01:27:53,534
- I know what needs to be done.
- Then do it!

1440
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,766
What? No. I can't do it.

1441
01:27:55,908 --> 01:27:57,809
Nobody takes me seriously.

1442
01:27:57,944 --> 01:28:01,003
I know that now.
This ain't Radiator Springs.

1443
01:28:01,146 --> 01:28:02,807
Yes, it is.

1444
01:28:03,115 --> 01:28:05,710
Look, you're yourself
in Radiator Springs.

1445
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:07,752
Be yourself here.

1446
01:28:07,854 --> 01:28:09,822
And if people aren't taking you
seriously,

1447
01:28:09,922 --> 01:28:12,516
then they need to change, not you.

1448
01:28:12,626 --> 01:28:14,719
I know that
because I was wrong before.

1449
01:28:15,395 --> 01:28:17,386
Now, you can do this. You're the bomb.

1450
01:28:17,564 --> 01:28:19,155
Thanks, buddy.

1451
01:28:19,265 --> 01:28:21,733
No, you're the actual bomb.
Now, let's go!

1452
01:28:21,835 --> 01:28:23,802
Oh, right. Hang on!

1453
01:28:25,537 --> 01:28:27,506
Where's he going?

1454
01:28:29,175 --> 01:28:31,109
<i>- Computer!
Yes, Agent Mater?</i>

1455
01:28:31,211 --> 01:28:34,043
I need that thing you done before
to get me away from McQueen!

1456
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:35,373
<i>Request acknowledged.</i>

1457
01:28:38,952 --> 01:28:41,113
- Mater?
- Now I need you to do the chute!

1458
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:43,154
The second kind, not the first!

1459
01:28:43,256 --> 01:28:45,052
<i>Deploying chute.</i>

1460
01:29:08,847 --> 01:29:10,405
Who's winning the race?

1461
01:29:14,787 --> 01:29:17,221
- Back off! Back away!
- It's Lightning McQueen!

1462
01:29:17,323 --> 01:29:19,449
No, it's OK! Tell 'em, Mater. Explain.

1463
01:29:19,626 --> 01:29:21,092
Okay.

1464
01:29:21,226 --> 01:29:22,694
Somebody's been sabotaging

1465
01:29:22,796 --> 01:29:25,060
the racers and hurtin' the cars,
and I know who.

1466
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:26,893
Oh, wait. Your Majesty.

1467
01:29:27,033 --> 01:29:29,001
Bomb! It's a bomb!

1468
01:29:29,735 --> 01:29:32,203
- Everybody, down!
- Back up! Move it!

1469
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,375
Get off the stage! Move it!

1470
01:29:36,475 --> 01:29:39,444
Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!

1471
01:29:39,612 --> 01:29:42,911
Mater, I don't know what you're doing,
but stand down now.

1472
01:29:43,048 --> 01:29:45,779
This ain't nothing at all
like Radiator Springs.

1473
01:29:45,885 --> 01:29:47,819
Mater, just cut to the chase.

1474
01:29:47,921 --> 01:29:49,854
Okay. It's him.

1475
01:29:49,956 --> 01:29:52,981
What? Me? You've got to be crazy.

1476
01:29:53,092 --> 01:29:55,027
I figured it out when I realized

1477
01:29:55,127 --> 01:29:58,586
y'all attached this ticking time bomb
with Whitworth bolts -

1478
01:29:58,698 --> 01:30:02,064
the same bolts that hold together that
old British engine from the photograph.

1479
01:30:03,434 --> 01:30:04,662
- Holley! Show that picture.
- OK.

1480
01:30:05,136 --> 01:30:07,729
I remembered what they say
about old British engines:

1481
01:30:07,872 --> 01:30:10,466
If there ain't no oil under 'em,
there ain't no oil in 'em.

1482
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,506
What is he talking about?

1483
01:30:12,676 --> 01:30:15,202
It was you leaking oil
at the party in Japan.

1484
01:30:15,313 --> 01:30:16,939
You just blamed it on me.

1485
01:30:17,081 --> 01:30:19,605
Electric cars don't use oil, you twit.

1486
01:30:19,716 --> 01:30:22,948
Then you're fakin' it.
You didn't convert to no electric.

1487
01:30:24,122 --> 01:30:26,954
If we pop that hood,
we'll see that engine from that picture.

1488
01:30:27,358 --> 01:30:28,854
This lorry's crazy!
He's going to kill us all!

1489
01:30:28,889 --> 01:30:30,350
This lorry's crazy!
He's going to kill us all!

1490
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,686
Stay away!

1491
01:30:32,796 --> 01:30:36,663
But Sir Axlerod created the race.
Why would he want to hurt anyone?

1492
01:30:36,766 --> 01:30:40,259
To make allinol look bad so
everybody'd go back to using oil.

1493
01:30:40,369 --> 01:30:42,895
He said it himself
with that disguised voice.

1494
01:30:43,006 --> 01:30:47,033
Disguised voice? What are you
talking about? You're nuts, you are!

1495
01:30:47,144 --> 01:30:49,976
This is going nowhere fast.
We really should go, Grandmother.

1496
01:30:50,247 --> 01:30:52,578
One moment, I'd like to see
where this is going.

1497
01:30:53,716 --> 01:30:55,514
Mater, he created allinol.

1498
01:30:55,685 --> 01:30:57,345
But what if he found that huge oil field

1499
01:30:57,487 --> 01:30:59,954
just as the world was trying to find
something else?

1500
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:03,890
What if he came up with allinol
just to make alternative fuel look bad?

1501
01:31:03,993 --> 01:31:06,792
"What if?"
You're basing this on a "what if"?

1502
01:31:06,930 --> 01:31:08,988
- Okay, that's it.
- Lads, clear out.

1503
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:12,192
Wait! Somebody save me!
The lorry's crazy!

1504
01:31:12,335 --> 01:31:14,131
- Keep away, you idiot!
- Mater!

1505
01:31:15,005 --> 01:31:17,496
- Mater!
- Someone do something!

1506
01:31:20,176 --> 01:31:21,390
You're insane, you are! Deactivate!

1507
01:31:21,425 --> 01:31:22,603
You're insane, you are! Deactivate!

1508
01:31:24,313 --> 01:31:28,340
<i>Bomb deactivated.
Have a nice day, Sir Axlerod.</i>

1509
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:39,024
- The engine from the photo.
- It's a perfect match.

1510
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:40,405
How did the tow truck figure it out?

1511
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:41,652
How did the tow truck figure it out?

1512
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:45,061
It's official. You're coming to
all my races from now on.

1513
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:47,134
Now you're talkin'!

1514
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:52,372
Hyeeugh!

1515
01:31:55,542 --> 01:31:57,806
Mater, let's go. You're on.

1516
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,514
Your Majesty, may I present

1517
01:32:04,618 --> 01:32:08,578
for the investiture of honorary
knighthood of the British Realm...

1518
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:12,158
Tow Mater of Radiator Springs.

1519
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:14,228
Go get 'em, buddy.

1520
01:32:21,903 --> 01:32:26,636
I hereby dub thee Sir Tow Mater.

1521
01:32:28,275 --> 01:32:31,541
Sir? Shoot, you can just call me Mater,
Your Majesty.

1522
01:32:31,645 --> 01:32:33,876
I don't wanna hear none of this "sir"
business.

1523
01:32:34,015 --> 01:32:36,006
By the way, have y'all met each other?

1524
01:32:36,117 --> 01:32:37,845
Queen, McQueen. McQueen, Queen.

1525
01:32:37,985 --> 01:32:39,886
McQueen, McMissile. McMissile,
McQueen. Queen, McMissile.

1526
01:32:45,858 --> 01:32:48,850
So there we was,
my rocket jets going full blast,

1527
01:32:48,961 --> 01:32:50,895
McQueen hanging on for dear life

1528
01:32:51,029 --> 01:32:54,931
when suddenly them two nasty lemons
come out of nowheres, guns drawed.

1529
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:56,795
We was goners.

1530
01:32:56,902 --> 01:33:00,064
But then, out of nowhere
this beautiful spy car

1531
01:33:00,171 --> 01:33:02,140
swoops in from the sky to save us!

1532
01:33:02,274 --> 01:33:05,208
That's a very entertaining story,
young man.

1533
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:07,244
Oh, Minny, please. Come on!

1534
01:33:07,345 --> 01:33:11,145
None of this happened.
Rocket jets, flying spy cars.

1535
01:33:11,283 --> 01:33:14,740
No, you're quite right.
It does sound a bit far-fetched.

1536
01:33:14,886 --> 01:33:16,684
Holley! What are you doin' here?

1537
01:33:16,788 --> 01:33:19,689
Hello, Mater!
It's so good to see you again.

1538
01:33:19,792 --> 01:33:20,759
Finn!

1539
01:33:20,859 --> 01:33:22,952
Our satellites picked up
an urgent communiquÃÂ©.

1540
01:33:23,127 --> 01:33:24,823
So you got-a my email.

1541
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:27,329
Y'all is going to have a great time!

1542
01:33:27,466 --> 01:33:31,300
Everybody, this here's Finn McMissile.
He's a secret agent.

1543
01:33:31,403 --> 01:33:32,529
Don't tell nobody.

1544
01:33:32,671 --> 01:33:34,639
And this is Holley Shiftwell.

1545
01:33:34,739 --> 01:33:36,707
- She's...
- I'm Mater's girlfriend.

1546
01:33:36,809 --> 01:33:38,743
It's so nice to meet you all.

1547
01:33:38,877 --> 01:33:41,037
Guido believe you now.

1548
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:43,739
Whoa, honey.
You got a nasty dent there.

1549
01:33:43,881 --> 01:33:45,679
- Yeah.
- Was that from when you swooped in

1550
01:33:45,783 --> 01:33:47,581
and you saved them in London?

1551
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:49,688
- Van!
- What? I'm just asking!

1552
01:33:49,787 --> 01:33:54,452
Don't you worry. My baby Ramone
can get that fixed up for you in no time.

1553
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,586
Yeah, sure thing.
No problemo. Let me go get my tools.

1554
01:33:57,729 --> 01:34:00,493
Oh, no. I'm keeping that dent.
It's way too valuable.

1555
01:34:01,766 --> 01:34:05,930
A valuable dent?
She's as crazy as Mater.

1556
01:34:06,037 --> 01:34:07,801
Those two are perfect for each other.

1557
01:34:07,939 --> 01:34:10,408
There's one thing I still don't get.

1558
01:34:10,542 --> 01:34:13,340
The bad guys hit me with the beam
from the camera, right?

1559
01:34:13,444 --> 01:34:17,073
- So, why didn't I...
- Explode in a fiery inferno?

1560
01:34:17,216 --> 01:34:19,309
- Yeah.
- We couldn't figure that out, either.

1561
01:34:19,417 --> 01:34:22,409
Our investigation proved
that allinol was actually gasoline

1562
01:34:22,554 --> 01:34:25,819
and Axlerod engineered it so when it
got hit by the beam, it would explode.

1563
01:34:25,957 --> 01:34:29,984
Wait a second, Fillmore.
You said my fuel was safe!

1564
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:37,594
If you're implying that I switched
that rot-gut excuse for alternative fuel

1565
01:34:37,735 --> 01:34:41,569
with my all-natural, sustainable,
organic biofuel

1566
01:34:41,673 --> 01:34:47,010
just because I never trusted Axlerod,
you're dead wrong, man!

1567
01:34:47,145 --> 01:34:49,171
It was him!

1568
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:53,307
Once big oil, always big oil, man.

1569
01:34:53,418 --> 01:34:54,818
Tree-hugger.

1570
01:34:55,753 --> 01:34:59,246
The Radiator Springs Grand Prix
is about to begin.

1571
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:01,654
All spectators, clear the starting line.

1572
01:35:04,563 --> 01:35:07,030
I can't wait to get rockin'.
This is gonna be wicked!

1573
01:35:07,166 --> 01:35:08,757
We should do this every year.

1574
01:35:08,867 --> 01:35:11,961
Yeah, I just figured we never found out
who the world's fastest car is.

1575
01:35:12,070 --> 01:35:14,595
Plus, no press, no trophy, just racing.

1576
01:35:14,707 --> 01:35:18,268
- The way I like it.
- Francesco likes it like this, too.

1577
01:35:18,409 --> 01:35:21,970
<i>- Francesco, I'd like you to meet...
- Signorina Sally.</i>

1578
01:35:22,081 --> 01:35:23,412
It is official.

1579
01:35:23,515 --> 01:35:26,039
Lightning McQueen
is the luckiest car in the world.

1580
01:35:26,185 --> 01:35:28,243
Why, thank you.

1581
01:35:28,386 --> 01:35:31,447
Which he will have to be to have
a chance against Francesco today!

1582
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:34,615
See you at the finish line, Mc...
What is that?

1583
01:35:34,859 --> 01:35:37,192
Just something I had made up
for the occasion.

1584
01:35:37,595 --> 01:35:39,564
Is-a good, McQueen. Very funny.

1585
01:35:39,664 --> 01:35:42,462
Was-a funnier when I did it,
but it's-a very funny.

1586
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:45,797
What are you going to do next?
Are you going to take off your fenders?

1587
01:35:45,904 --> 01:35:47,599
Try it. You'll like it.

1588
01:35:47,706 --> 01:35:49,867
So, he's not so good-looking.

1589
01:35:50,007 --> 01:35:52,305
- Yeah. Nice try.
- I'm serious!

1590
01:35:52,444 --> 01:35:54,639
That's why I love you, Sally.

1591
01:35:54,747 --> 01:35:57,511
- Wish me luck!
- You don't need it!

1592
01:35:57,649 --> 01:36:01,448
Ooh-hm!
That Francesco is fine-looking!

1593
01:36:01,552 --> 01:36:03,077
And those open wheels.

1594
01:36:03,221 --> 01:36:06,190
Ooh, I'm gonna have to go get myself
some coolant.

1595
01:36:17,636 --> 01:36:18,796
Go, Lightning!

1596
01:36:37,322 --> 01:36:38,948
- Go, Stickers!
- Right on, man!

1597
01:36:39,091 --> 01:36:41,024
- Go get 'em, tiger!
- Bravo, bravo!

1598
01:36:41,126 --> 01:36:44,458
- Go, Lightning, go!
- Go, McQueen! Whoo-hoo!

1599
01:36:44,563 --> 01:36:46,962
Finn? Time to go.

1600
01:36:47,099 --> 01:36:49,328
Siddeley's gassed, geared
and ready to fly.

1601
01:36:50,202 --> 01:36:53,329
- You're leavin' already?
- We've got another mission.

1602
01:36:53,471 --> 01:36:55,770
Just stopped by here
to pick something up.

1603
01:36:56,908 --> 01:37:00,572
Somethin' tells me you're not
talkin' about souvenir bumper stickers.

1604
01:37:00,712 --> 01:37:03,043
Her Majesty asked for you personally,
Mater.

1605
01:37:03,148 --> 01:37:06,480
- But I told y'all before, I'm not a spy.
- We know.

1606
01:37:06,585 --> 01:37:10,247
Spy or not, you're still the smartest,
most honest chap we've ever met.

1607
01:37:10,389 --> 01:37:13,721
- Don't forget massively charming.
- Well, thanks.

1608
01:37:13,826 --> 01:37:16,920
But as much fun as it was
hangin' with y'all, this...

1609
01:37:17,029 --> 01:37:19,690
This is home.

1610
01:37:19,797 --> 01:37:22,664
That's all right. We understand.
But I'll be back.

1611
01:37:22,768 --> 01:37:24,599
You still owe me that first date.

1612
01:37:24,735 --> 01:37:27,704
If there's ever anything I can do for you,
just let me know.

1613
01:37:27,805 --> 01:37:30,001
Well, I sure appreciate that. Thank you.

1614
01:37:31,376 --> 01:37:34,105
Actually, there is one thing.

1615
01:37:34,645 --> 01:37:36,944
Whoo-hoo!

1616
01:37:37,048 --> 01:37:38,983
Whoo! I'll be doggone!

1617
01:37:43,788 --> 01:37:45,188
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1618
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:49,750
Thanks, Mater!

1619
01:37:57,269 --> 01:37:59,237
Ha-ha-ha! Whoo!

1620
01:38:01,006 --> 01:38:02,837
Impossible!

1621
01:38:03,408 --> 01:38:04,841
- Ha-ha!
- Mater!

1622
01:38:04,976 --> 01:38:07,537
Check it out.
They let me keep the rockets.

1623
01:38:07,645 --> 01:38:09,738
I'll see you at the finish line, buddy!

1624
01:38:09,847 --> 01:38:11,782
Not if I see you first!

1625
01:38:11,884 --> 01:38:13,851
Yippee!
