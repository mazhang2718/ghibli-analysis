1
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,879
Where are you?

2
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,000
Come out! Come out!

3
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,900
Come on out!

4
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,850
I'm coming to get you!

5
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Where are you, you little rascal, I'm coming to get you! Hm.

6
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,608
Where is my little birthday girl, hm?

7
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,400
I'm going to gobble her up, when I find her!

8
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,800
I'm going to eat you, om nom nom

9
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,500
Oh, Fergus! No weapons on the table!

10
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:59,161
Can I shoot an arrow, can I, can I, can I? Please, can I?

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,650
Not with that!

12
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:05,465
Why not use your very own!

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,760
Happy birthday my wee darling!

14
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,200
Now, there's a good girl. Draw all the way back now to your cheek, that's right!

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,599
Keep both eyes open...and...loose!

16
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,400
I missed.

17
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:32,249
Go and fetch it then!

18
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:32,594
A bow, Fergus? She's a lady! Oh!

19
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,913
A will-o'-the-wisp!

20
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,148
They are real!

21
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,800
Merida! Come on, sweetheart!

22
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,032
We're leaving now!

23
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,452
I saw a wisp!

24
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,990
I saw a wisp.

25
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,900
A wisp?

26
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,542
You know, some say, that will-o'-the wisps lead you to your fate.

27
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:47,764
Oh, aye, or an arrow!

28
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:52,846
Come on, let's be off before we see a dancing tattybogle or a giant having a jigger in the bluebells...

29
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,962
Your father doesn't believe in magic.

30
00:03:55,963 --> 00:03:58,378
Well, he should, 'cause it's true!

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,505
Mor'du!

32
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:02,550
Elinor, run!

33
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,032
Come on, you!

34
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,999
BRAVE

35
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,143
Some say, our destiny is tied to the land.

36
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:34,915
As much a part of us as we are of it.

37
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,100
Others say, fate is vowen together like a cloth.

38
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,706
So that one's destiny intertwines with many others.

39
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,849
It's the one thing we search for, or fight to change.

40
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,665
Some never find it.

41
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,198
But there are some, who are led.

42
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,610
The story of how my father lost his leg to the demon bear Mor'du became legend.

43
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,335
I became a sister, to three new brothers! The princes: Hamish, Hubert and Harris.

44
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,869
Wee devils, more like.

45
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,928
They'd get away with murder!

46
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,616
I can never get away with anything!

47
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,420
I'm the princess!

48
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,263
I'm the example!

49
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,400
I've got duties, responsibilities, expectations...

50
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,608
My whole life is planned out!

51
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,100
Preparing for the day I'd become, well, my mother.

52
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,146
She is in charge of every single day of my life.

53
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,005
Hey Robin, jolly Robin, and thou shalt know of mine...

54
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:01,100
Project!

55
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,738
And thou shalt know of mine!

56
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:08,988
Enunciate, you must be understood from anywhere in the room! Or it's all for naught.

57
00:06:09,023 --> 00:06:10,613
This is all for naught.

58
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:11,714
I heard that!

59
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,981
From the top!

60
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,978
A princess must be knowledgeable about her kingdom.

61
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,718
She does nae doodle!

62
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,594
That's a C, dear.

63
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,308
A princess does not chortle!

64
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,950
Does nae stuff her gob!

65
00:06:34,951 --> 00:06:36,750
Rises early!

66
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:37,692
Is compassionate.

67
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,053
Patient.

68
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:39,922
Cautious!

69
00:06:39,923 --> 00:06:40,837
Clean.

70
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:48,298
And, above all, a princess strives for, well, perfection!

71
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:56,177
But every once in a while there's a day when I don't have to be a princess.

72
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,193
No lessons, no expectations, a day when anything can happen!

73
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,891
Day, I can change my fate!

74
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,084
I'm starving!

75
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,702
You're hungry too, I guess?

76
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,897
Oats it is then.

77
00:09:26,423 --> 00:09:30,825
And then, out of nowhere, the biggest bear you've ever seen!

78
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:38,372
His hide littered with the weapons of fallen warriors, his face scarred, with one dead eye.

79
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:40,210
I drew my sword and...

80
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:44,047
Woosh! With one swipe his sword shattered

81
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:50,006
and then chomp! Dad's leg was clean off! Down the monster's throat it went.

82
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,977
Oh, that's my favourite part!

83
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:56,410
Mor'du has never been seen since!

84
00:09:56,411 --> 00:10:02,268
And is roaming the wilds waiting his chance of revenge! Arrrgh!

85
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,889
Let him return. I'll finish what I'd guddled in the first place.

86
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,694
Merida, a princess does not place her weapons on the table

87
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:11,943
Mom!

88
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,526
It's just my bow!

89
00:10:13,527 --> 00:10:16,786
A princess should not have weapons in my opinion.

90
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:21,392
Leave her be! Princess or not, learning to fight is essential.

91
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:23,953
Mom, you'll never guess what I did today.

92
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:24,628
Mhm?

93
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:28,040
I climbed the Queen's Tooth and drank from the Fire Falls!

94
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:33,392
Fire Falls? They say only the ancient kings were brave enough to drink the fire.

95
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,733
What did you do, dear?

96
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,118
Nothing, mom.

97
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,214
Hungry, aren't we?

98
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:39,954
Mom!

99
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:41,184
You'll get dreadful gollywobbles!

100
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:44,517
Oh Fergus! Will you look at your daughter's plate?

101
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,176
So what?

102
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,757
Don't let them lick...

103
00:10:48,758 --> 00:10:51,931
Boys, you're naughty! Don't just play with your haggis.

104
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,914
Oh, now, how'd you know you don't like it if you won't try it?

105
00:10:56,915 --> 00:11:01,868
It's just a wee sheep stomach! It's delicious! Mmm.

106
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:02,701
Mylady.

107
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:04,235
Thank you Maudie.

108
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:13,859
Aha. From the lords Macintosh,  MacGuffin and Dingwall.

109
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,877
Their responses, no doubt.

110
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,996
Stay out of my food, you greedy mongrels! Chew on that, you manky dogs!

111
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:27,908
Fergus?

112
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:31,297
They've all accepted!

113
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:35,493
Who's accepted what, mother?

114
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:38,875
Boys, you are excused.

115
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,777
What did I do now?

116
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:51,299
Your father has something to discuss with you.

117
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:54,095
Fergus?

118
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:02,466
Merida.

119
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:10,674
The lords are presenting their sons as suitors for your betrothal!

120
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:11,353
What?

121
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,569
The clans have accepted!

122
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,647
Dad!

123
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:19,268
What? I...you....she....Elinor?

124
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:22,101
Honestly, Merida. I don't know why are you reacting this way.

125
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:27,241
This year, each clan will present a suitor to compete in the games for your hand.

126
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:29,504
I suppose a princess just does what she's told!

127
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:31,672
A princess does not raise her voice!

128
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,841
Merida, this is what you've been preparing for your whole life!

129
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:39,688
No, it's what you've been preparing me for my whole life!

130
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:41,156
I won't go through with it!

131
00:12:41,157 --> 00:12:42,622
You can't make me!

132
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,471
Merida!

133
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:46,537
Merida!

134
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,325
Boys!

135
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:57,260
Mother!

136
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:58,896
Suitors!

137
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:00,185
Marriage!

138
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:03,253
Once, there was an ancient kingdom.

139
00:13:03,254 --> 00:13:04,761
Oh, mom!

140
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,684
Ancient kingdom.

141
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:09,185
Its name long forgotten.

142
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:14,143
Ruled by a wise and fair king who was much beloved.

143
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:19,264
And when he grew old, he divided the kingdom among his four sons,

144
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:24,277
that they should be the pillars on which the peace of the land rested.

145
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:30,206
But, the oldest prince wanted to rule the land for himself.

146
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:38,335
He followed his own path and the kingdom fell to war and chaos and ruin.

147
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:39,934
That's a nice story!

148
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:42,824
It's not just a story, Merida.

149
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,934
Legends are lessons, they ring with truths.

150
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:47,492
Ah, mom!

151
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,501
I would advise you to make your peace with this.

152
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:51,821
The clans are coming to present their suitors.

153
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:53,401
It's not fair!

154
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:56,637
Oh, Merida, it's marriage. It's not the end of the world.

155
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,109
You're muttering.

156
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,297
I don't mutter.

157
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:12,176
Aye, you do, you mutter, lass. When something's troubling you.

158
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:16,303
I blame you. The stubborness. It's entirely from your side of the family.

159
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:19,249
I take it it all didn't go too well?

160
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,719
I don't know what to do.

161
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,433
Speak to her, dear!

162
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:26,658
I do speak to her! She just doesn't listen!

163
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:28,743
Come on, now.

164
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,814
Pretend I'm Merida. Speak to me. What would you say?

165
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:35,066
Oh, I can't do this!

166
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:37,365
Sure you can!

167
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:39,850
There, there! That's my Queen.

168
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:40,904
Right, here we go.

169
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:45,885
I don't want to get married! I want to stay single and let my hair flow in the wind

170
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:50,065
as I ride through the glen firing arrows into the sunset.

171
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:01,404
Merida. All this work, all the time spent preparing you, schooling you,

172
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:07,907
giving you everything we never had...I ask you, what do you expect us to do?

173
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:11,539
Call off the gathering! Would that kill them?

174
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,710
You're the Queen, you can just tell the lords, the princess is not ready for this.

175
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,843
In fact, she might not ever be ready for this so that's that.

176
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:24,144
Good day to you. We'll expect your declarations of war in the morning.

177
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:30,275
I understand this must all seem unfair, even I had reservations when I faced betrothal.

178
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:33,457
We can't just run away from who we are!

179
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,077
I don't want my life to be over.

180
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:37,822
I want my freedom!

181
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:41,141
But are you willing to pay the price your freedom will cost?

182
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:43,123
I'm not doing any of this to hurt you.

183
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:48,342
If you could just try to see what I do, I do out of love.

184
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:50,373
But it's my life, it's...

185
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:53,907
I'm just not ready.

186
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:56,109
I think you'd see, if you could just...

187
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,256
I think I could make you understand if you would just...

188
00:15:59,257 --> 00:15:59,588
...listen!

189
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:00,625
...listen!

190
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:07,009
I swear, Angus, this isn't going to happen!

191
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:09,435
Not if I have any say in it.

192
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:27,778
MacGuffin!

193
00:16:32,552 --> 00:16:34,009
Dingwall!

194
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,683
Macintosh!

195
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,479
You look absolutely beautiful!

196
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,216
I can't breathe!

197
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,039
Oh, shush. Give us a turn.

198
00:17:01,392 --> 00:17:04,479
I can't move. It's too tight!

199
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,810
It's perfect!

200
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:20,705
Merida...

201
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,729
Mom?

202
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,737
Just...

203
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:31,674
...remeber to smile.

204
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:47,707
Oy, they're coming!

205
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:50,874
Places everyone! Places!

206
00:18:07,098 --> 00:18:09,626
I look fine, woman. Leave me be!

207
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:10,627
???

208
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:33,896
Oy!

209
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:51,453
So, here we are. The four clans.

210
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,101
Gathering.

211
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,302
For...

212
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,610
...the presentations of the suitors.

213
00:19:02,796 --> 00:19:02,796
Clan Macintosh.

214
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:10,685
Your Majesty, I present my heir and sire who defended our land

215
00:19:10,686 --> 00:19:19,010
from the Northern invaders and with his own sword stabbed bloody, vanquished a thousand foes!

216
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:23,697
Clan MacGuffin.

217
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:30,981
Good Majesty. I present my eldest son.

218
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:38,388
Who scuttled Viking longships and with his bare hands vanquished two thousand foes.

219
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:44,937
Clan Dingwall.

220
00:19:48,017 --> 00:19:56,182
I present my only son who was besieged by ten thousand Romans,

221
00:19:56,183 --> 00:20:00,755
and he took out a whole armada singlehandedly.

222
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:03,169
With one arm, he was...

223
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,428
With one arm, he was steering the ship

224
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:12,831
and with the other, he held his mighty sword and struck down a whole attacking fleet.

225
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:13,361
Lies!

226
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:14,123
What?

227
00:20:14,424 --> 00:20:16,884
I heard that! Come on, say it to my face!

228
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,438
Or are you scared simpering jackanapes, 'fraid to muss your pretty hair?

229
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:24,412
At least we have hair!

230
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:26,305
And all our teeth!

231
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:28,534
(thick accent) If he was a wee bit closer, I could lob a caber at him, ye ken.

232
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,870
And we don't hide under bridges, you grumpy old troll!

233
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:41,772
You want a laugh, eh? Wee Dingwall!

234
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:59,811
At him, at him! That's the way to...

235
00:21:01,954 --> 00:21:03,019
All right.

236
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:06,687
Shut it!

237
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:11,344
Now, that's all done.

238
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:14,910
You've had your go at each other, show a little decorum!

239
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,598
And no more fighting!

240
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:01,860
I didn't start it was he...

241
00:22:02,313 --> 00:22:06,193
Mylady Queen, I feel terrible, my humblest apologies.
Sorry....We meant no disrespect.

242
00:22:06,228 --> 00:22:09,440
Sorry, love, I didn't, but...Yes, dear.

243
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:12,390
Now, where were we.

244
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:18,677
Ah, yes. In accordance with our laws, by the rights of our heritage

245
00:22:18,678 --> 00:22:24,855
only the firstborn of each of the great leaders may be presented as champion.

246
00:22:24,856 --> 00:22:25,336
Firstborn?

247
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:29,865
And thus compete for the hand of the princess of DunBroch.

248
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:37,709
To win the fair maiden, they must prove their worth by feats of strength or arms in the games.

249
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:42,438
It is customary that the challenge be determined by the princess herself.

250
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:44,151
Archery, archery!

251
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:50,883
I choose...archery.

252
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:53,720
Let the games begin!

253
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:18,463
Pull!

254
00:23:44,544 --> 00:23:46,849
I have told  you, you're not allowed...

255
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:10,337
It's time!

256
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,523
Archers, to your marks!

257
00:24:14,524 --> 00:24:16,439
Aye, archers to your marks!

258
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,409
And may the lucky arrow find its target.

259
00:24:29,422 --> 00:24:31,169
Oy, get on with it!

260
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:44,894
I bet he wishes he was tossing cabers.

261
00:24:44,895 --> 00:24:46,469
Or holding up bridges.

262
00:24:53,731 --> 00:24:56,247
Noooo!

263
00:24:56,248 --> 00:24:59,048
At least you hit the target, son!

264
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,231
Oh, that's attractive.

265
00:25:05,266 --> 00:25:06,699
I've got it!

266
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,945
Good arm.

267
00:25:07,946 --> 00:25:11,357
And such lovely flowing locks!

268
00:25:11,358 --> 00:25:11,847
Fergus!

269
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:12,588
What?

270
00:25:22,263 --> 00:25:23,850
Oh, wee lamb!

271
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:32,188
Oh, come on, shoot, boy!

272
00:25:34,813 --> 00:25:36,246
Well done!

273
00:25:40,345 --> 00:25:41,676
Feast your eyes!

274
00:25:41,977 --> 00:25:44,078
That's my boy!

275
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:49,762
Well, that's just grand now, isn't it?

276
00:25:49,763 --> 00:25:52,552
Guess who's coming to dinner.

277
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:53,151
Fergus!

278
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,637
By the way, hope you don't mind being called lade Ding...

279
00:26:03,658 --> 00:26:09,001
I am Merida, firstborn descendant of clan DunBroch.

280
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:12,766
And I'll be shooting for my own hand!

281
00:26:14,396 --> 00:26:16,336
What are you doing?

282
00:26:19,555 --> 00:26:20,348
Merida!

283
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:23,735
Curse this dress!

284
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:32,376
Merida! Stop this!

285
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:38,907
Don't you dare loose another arrow!

286
00:26:48,804 --> 00:26:51,307
Merida! I forbid it!

287
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:24,777
I've just about had enough of you, lass!

288
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:26,173
You're the one that wants me to...

289
00:27:26,174 --> 00:27:28,524
You've embarrassed them. You've embarrassed me.

290
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:29,472
I followed the rules!

291
00:27:29,473 --> 00:27:30,210
You don't know what you've done!

292
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,945
I don't care...

293
00:27:31,946 --> 00:27:33,542
There'll be fire and swords if it's not set right.

294
00:27:33,543 --> 00:27:35,142
Just listen!

295
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:38,014
I am the Queen! You listen to me!

296
00:27:38,015 --> 00:27:40,384
Oh, this is so unfair!

297
00:27:40,685 --> 00:27:42,270
Unfair?

298
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:43,702
You're never there for me.

299
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,552
This whole marriage is what you want!

300
00:27:46,553 --> 00:27:48,598
Do you ever bother to ask what I want?

301
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:53,365
No! You walk around telling me what to do, what not to do,

302
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:55,286
trying to make me feel like you.

303
00:27:55,287 --> 00:27:58,078
Well, I'm not going to be like you!

304
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,655
Oh, you're acting like a child.

305
00:27:59,656 --> 00:28:04,420
And you're a beast! That's what you are!

306
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:04,664
Merida!

307
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:06,661
I'll never be like you!

308
00:28:06,662 --> 00:28:07,362
No, stop that!

309
00:28:07,363 --> 00:28:09,745
I'd rather die than be like you!

310
00:28:14,768 --> 00:28:20,130
Merida, you are a princess, I expect you to act like one!

311
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,454
Merida!

312
00:28:29,655 --> 00:28:32,535
Merida!

313
00:28:34,118 --> 00:28:35,030
Oh, dear!

314
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,269
Oh, no. What've I done.

315
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:20,939
Angus!

316
00:30:07,236 --> 00:30:08,156
Come on, Angus!

317
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:11,076
Angus!

318
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:01,946
Why would the wisps lead me here?

319
00:31:28,026 --> 00:31:31,819
Oh, look around. You holler if you see anything you like.

320
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,199
Everything is half off.

321
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:41,126
Who are you?

322
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:43,120
Just a humble woodcarver.

323
00:31:44,214 --> 00:31:46,202
I don't understand.

324
00:31:47,427 --> 00:31:48,417
See anything you like?

325
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:53,789
Perhaps a touch of whimsy to brighten any dank chamber.

326
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:57,040
But, the will-o'-the-wisps! They lead...

327
00:31:57,041 --> 00:32:01,202
Oh, this is one of a kind! I'll make you a deal for this rare prize.

328
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:03,898
Your broom!

329
00:32:05,521 --> 00:32:07,392
It was sweeping by itself!

330
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:08,084
That's ridiculous.

331
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:11,432
Wood cannae be imbued with magical properties.

332
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:14,120
I should know, I'm a wi...whittler!

333
00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:16,862
Of wood.

334
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:20,055
How about this conversation starter?

335
00:32:20,056 --> 00:32:22,211
It's made of yew wood.

336
00:32:22,212 --> 00:32:23,596
Half a stone.

337
00:32:23,897 --> 00:32:26,978
Oh, ah ah, that's daft.

338
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:29,419
Staring is rude!

339
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,966
The crow... crow's talking!

340
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:33,085
That's not all I can do. La la la la.

341
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,048
You're a witch!

342
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:44,408
Woodcarver!

343
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:46,702
That's why the wisps led me here!

344
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:47,986
Woodcarver!

345
00:32:47,987 --> 00:32:49,583
You'll change my fate!

346
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:50,625
WOODCARVER!

347
00:32:50,626 --> 00:32:52,234
You see, it's my mother...

348
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:55,427
I'm not a witch! Too many unsatisfied customers.

349
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,498
If you're not going to buy anything, get out!

350
00:33:02,877 --> 00:33:04,535
No, the wisps led me here!

351
00:33:04,536 --> 00:33:06,279
I don't care!

352
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:10,043
Get out! Shoo! Get! Begone with you!

353
00:33:10,078 --> 00:33:11,522
I'll buy it all!

354
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:12,859
What, what was that?

355
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,864
Every carving.

356
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:21,087
And how are you going to pay for that, sweetie?

357
00:33:21,088 --> 00:33:22,128
With this.

358
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,195
Oh my, that's lovely, that is.

359
00:33:29,196 --> 00:33:30,634
That will set us up for months!

360
00:33:34,185 --> 00:33:39,372
Every carving and one spell.

361
00:33:40,565 --> 00:33:43,428
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

362
00:33:43,629 --> 00:33:46,873
I want a spell to change my mom.

363
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:48,822
That'll change my fate.

364
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:50,994
Done!

365
00:33:53,084 --> 00:33:53,700
Where are you going?

366
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,120
There.

367
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:58,010
What're you doing?

368
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,264
You never conjure where you carve, very important.

369
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:09,291
Last time I did this was for a prince.

370
00:34:10,796 --> 00:34:11,927
Easy on the eyes.

371
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,960
He demanded I give him the strength of ten men.

372
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:20,315
And he gave me this for a spell.

373
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:22,507
A spell that would change his fate.

374
00:34:24,538 --> 00:34:26,181
And did he get what he was after?

375
00:34:26,182 --> 00:34:31,408
Ohoho, yes. I made off with an especially atractive mahogany cheeseboard.

376
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:33,765
Now, what do I need?

377
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:46,179
That'll do.

378
00:35:04,328 --> 00:35:08,052
And, now, let's see.

379
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:10,394
What have we here?

380
00:35:19,387 --> 00:35:20,665
A cake?

381
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:21,740
You don't want it?

382
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:23,375
Yes, I want it!

383
00:35:24,197 --> 00:35:30,181
You're sure, if I give this to my mom, it will change my fate?

384
00:35:30,182 --> 00:35:32,922
Ohh, trust me.

385
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:35,564
It'll do the trick, dearie.

386
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:40,370
Expect delivery of your purchase within a fortnight.

387
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:45,939
What was that thing about the spell?

388
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:53,094
Did you say something...about...the...spell?

389
00:36:23,194 --> 00:36:24,311
Merida!

390
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:24,811
Mom!

391
00:36:24,812 --> 00:36:27,143
Oh...eh...I...eh...

392
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,131
Oh, I've been worried sick!

393
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:30,497
You, you were?

394
00:36:30,498 --> 00:36:33,433
I didn't know where you've gone or when you'd come back!

395
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:36,286
I didn't know what to think! Oh, look at your dress!

396
00:36:37,192 --> 00:36:38,415
Angus threw me.

397
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:39,801
But I'm not hurt!

398
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:41,856
Well, you're home now.

399
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:43,745
So that's the end of it.

400
00:36:44,528 --> 00:36:45,395
Honestly?

401
00:36:45,396 --> 00:36:47,747
I've pacified the lords for now.

402
00:36:48,048 --> 00:36:51,033
Your father's out there "entertaining" them.

403
00:36:51,034 --> 00:36:54,341
Come taste my blade you manky bear for gobbling up my leg!

404
00:36:54,842 --> 00:36:58,533
I'll hunt you, then I'll skin you, hang your noggin on a peg!

405
00:37:01,216 --> 00:37:04,719
Of course, we both know a decision still has to be made.

406
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:10,218
What's this?

407
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:15,021
It's a peace offering. I made it. For you. Special.

408
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:17,385
You made this for me?

409
00:37:24,552 --> 00:37:26,481
Interesting flavour.

410
00:37:26,482 --> 00:37:27,984
How do you feel?

411
00:37:28,485 --> 00:37:29,612
What is that?

412
00:37:29,613 --> 00:37:30,717
Different?

413
00:37:31,287 --> 00:37:34,729
Tart and gamey...

414
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:38,661
Have you changed your mind at all about the marriage and all that?

415
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:40,866
Oh, better.

416
00:37:41,061 --> 00:37:47,098
Now, why don't we go upstairs to the lords and put this whole kerfuffle to rest, hm?

417
00:37:55,844 --> 00:37:56,448
Mother?

418
00:37:56,649 --> 00:38:01,103
I'm woozy suddenly. Oh, my head's spinning like a top!

419
00:38:01,304 --> 00:38:01,802
Mom!

420
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:05,337
Oh, suddenly I'm not so well.

421
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,154
How do you feel about the marriage now?

422
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:10,087
Merida!

423
00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:12,224
Just take me to my room.

424
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,633
To the left, that's good, that's good.

425
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:18,281
A wee bit to the left, that's good.

426
00:38:18,316 --> 00:38:23,240
It's good enough. Now clean out of there boys, I don't want you to spoil my shot.

427
00:38:24,142 --> 00:38:25,240
Mylady Queen!

428
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,049
We've been waiting patiently.

429
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:32,376
My lords, I am out of sorts at the moment

430
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:37,240
but you shall have your answer.

431
00:38:39,008 --> 00:38:40,192
Presently.

432
00:38:40,596 --> 00:38:43,678
Now, if you'll excuse us.

433
00:38:45,862 --> 00:38:48,324
Elinor, look! It's Mor'du!

434
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:52,481
Elinor! Are you all right, dear?

435
00:38:52,482 --> 00:38:56,343
Fine, I'm fine. Go back to avenging your leg!

436
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,659
Aye, you heard her lads.

437
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,355
I dream about the perfect way to make this devil die.

438
00:39:06,856 --> 00:39:10,529
Just take all the time you need getting yourself right, mom.

439
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:14,837
And maybe in a bit you might have something new to say on the marriage?

440
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:17,186
What was in that cake?

441
00:39:18,031 --> 00:39:18,963
Cake?

442
00:39:20,864 --> 00:39:22,104
Mom?

443
00:39:22,247 --> 00:39:24,965
So I'll just tell them the wedding's off then.

444
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:30,486
Mom?

445
00:39:58,793 --> 00:40:00,375
Bear!

446
00:40:34,456 --> 00:40:35,698
Mom?

447
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,752
You're...you're a bear!

448
00:40:42,747 --> 00:40:44,028
Why a bear?

449
00:40:45,296 --> 00:40:48,345
That's scaffy witch gave me a gammy spell!

450
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:52,049
It's not my fault!

451
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,012
I didn't ask her to change you into a bear.

452
00:40:54,013 --> 00:40:59,286
I just wanted her to change...you.

453
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,082
Shh, did you hear that?

454
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:09,423
Something's not right.

455
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,367
There's no point in having a go at me.

456
00:41:14,668 --> 00:41:16,191
The witch is to blame.

457
00:41:16,492 --> 00:41:17,841
Goggly old hag!

458
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:21,079
Eyes all over the place.

459
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,178
God. It's unbelievable!

460
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:28,416
How I'm going to fix this.

461
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:36,100
Everybody, follow me!

462
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:39,169
And you keep a sharp eye!

463
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:43,352
Here we go. Another hunt through the castle.

464
00:41:43,353 --> 00:41:45,084
We haven't even had a dessert yet.

465
00:41:45,164 --> 00:41:49,411
(unintelligible Doric accent)

466
00:41:51,112 --> 00:41:52,873
I have no idea.

467
00:41:53,412 --> 00:41:56,173
Mom, you can't go out there!

468
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,292
Mom!

469
00:41:58,693 --> 00:42:00,029
Wait!

470
00:42:01,307 --> 00:42:02,578
What're you doing?

471
00:42:03,102 --> 00:42:04,013
Dad!

472
00:42:04,014 --> 00:42:05,471
The Bear King?

473
00:42:05,472 --> 00:42:07,531
If he so much as sees you, you're dead!

474
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:11,117
Another one of your entertainments. Where is the end.

475
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:16,094
Oh, and just what exactly are we after, my liege?

476
00:42:16,129 --> 00:42:19,452
Best to humour him. He is, after all, the king.

477
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,722
He is like a hound with that nose of his.

478
00:42:27,057 --> 00:42:30,801
Mom! Wait! We have to...

479
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:32,595
Follow me!

480
00:42:33,288 --> 00:42:34,394
Stop!

481
00:42:34,734 --> 00:42:36,143
Stop!

482
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:41,265
You're covered with fur!

483
00:42:41,266 --> 00:42:42,741
You're not naked!

484
00:42:42,742 --> 00:42:45,414
It's not like anyone's gonna see you!

485
00:42:52,767 --> 00:42:54,024
Now you've done it!

486
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,432
Maudie!

487
00:42:58,834 --> 00:43:00,865
Just calm down, lass. What is it?

488
00:43:02,276 --> 00:43:03,602
Spit it out, Maudie!

489
00:43:03,754 --> 00:43:05,062
A BEAR!

490
00:43:05,063 --> 00:43:06,037
I knew it!

491
00:43:08,029 --> 00:43:09,517
Would you just listen to me!

492
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:12,159
We can't go this way. You'll be seen!

493
00:43:12,902 --> 00:43:14,145
Quick! This way!

494
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:17,528
Mom?

495
00:43:33,516 --> 00:43:34,315
Mom?

496
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:56,811
A witch turned mom into a bear. It's not my fault.

497
00:43:56,812 --> 00:43:59,360
We've got to get out of the castle. I need your help.

498
00:44:00,957 --> 00:44:05,114
All right. You can have my desserts for two...three weeks!

499
00:44:06,831 --> 00:44:09,094
OK, fine. A year.

500
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:15,909
Did you hear that?

501
00:44:24,301 --> 00:44:25,534
There he goes!

502
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:38,776
There he goes!

503
00:44:52,585 --> 00:44:53,784
Come on, mom!

504
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:59,972
Do you think we should lay a trap?

505
00:44:59,973 --> 00:45:01,785
Try shutting yours!

506
00:45:05,261 --> 00:45:05,873
There he is!

507
00:45:19,652 --> 00:45:22,238
I'm sure it went this way.

508
00:45:22,985 --> 00:45:24,818
It must've sprouted wings!

509
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:28,284
It was carried away by a giant birdie.

510
00:45:28,285 --> 00:45:29,366
A dragon, perhaps.

511
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:32,059
Bear in that castle. Doesn't make sense.

512
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,777
It cannae open doors. It's got big giant paws.

513
00:45:35,158 --> 00:45:36,798
Let's just get inside.

514
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:40,355
It's locked.

515
00:45:40,356 --> 00:45:41,636
Dingwall was the last up.

516
00:45:41,637 --> 00:45:43,216
I propped it open with a stick.

517
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:53,700
What'd you see Maudie? Spit it out, Maudie!

518
00:45:54,323 --> 00:45:57,535
Oh, for goodness' sakes, Maudie, would you get a grip?

519
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:06,585
Come on, mom. Quick.

520
00:46:08,267 --> 00:46:09,167
Shhh!

521
00:46:27,572 --> 00:46:29,772
They'll be fine, won't you boys?

522
00:46:30,811 --> 00:46:32,611
Mom, we've got to hurry!

523
00:46:33,363 --> 00:46:34,836
Now, I'll be back soon.

524
00:46:34,837 --> 00:46:38,892
Go on and help yourself to anything you want, as a reward.

525
00:46:56,132 --> 00:46:57,534
Right.

526
00:47:03,628 --> 00:47:06,802
Oh, where are these wisps?

527
00:47:07,072 --> 00:47:08,548
Come out, wisps!

528
00:47:09,468 --> 00:47:10,432
Come on out!

529
00:47:11,868 --> 00:47:14,640
Lead me to the witch's cottage!

530
00:47:15,857 --> 00:47:16,913
I'm here!

531
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:21,809
Fine! Don't come out now that my mom's watching.

532
00:47:23,964 --> 00:47:25,838
I was standing right here!

533
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,288
And the wisp appeared right there!

534
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:32,007
Then a whole trail of them led me off into the forest.

535
00:47:34,212 --> 00:47:34,996
???

536
00:47:48,843 --> 00:47:51,009
Oh, mom! I know this place.

537
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:55,678
The witch's cottage...is this way!

538
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:56,970
Come on! Hurry!

539
00:48:07,258 --> 00:48:09,990
I can't believe it! I found it!

540
00:48:14,593 --> 00:48:17,909
No! She was here.

541
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:21,486
No, really. She was just here.

542
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:25,124
Oh, wait.

543
00:48:29,245 --> 00:48:34,542
No..no...no, no, no!

544
00:48:59,868 --> 00:49:05,957
Welcome to the Crafty Carver, home of bear-themed carvings and novelties.

545
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:08,714
I am completely out of stock at this time.

546
00:49:08,715 --> 00:49:14,045
But if you'd like to inquire about portraits or wedding cake toppers

547
00:49:14,046 --> 00:49:16,425
pour vial one into the cauldron.

548
00:49:16,426 --> 00:49:19,502
If you'd like a menu in Gaelic, vial two.

549
00:49:19,537 --> 00:49:22,158
If you're that red-haired lass, vial three.

550
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,440
To speak with a live homunculus...

551
00:49:25,307 --> 00:49:29,548
Princess! I'm off to the Wickerman festival in Stoneham

552
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:30,997
and I won't be back till spring.

553
00:49:30,998 --> 00:49:34,871
There's one bit I forgot to tell you about the spell.

554
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:39,043
By the second sunrise, your spell will be permanent.

555
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:43,032
Unless you remember these words:

556
00:49:44,233 --> 00:49:52,143
"Fate be changed. Look inside, mend the bond torn by pride."

557
00:49:53,044 --> 00:49:56,501
Fate be changed, mend the bond. What does that mean?

558
00:49:56,889 --> 00:49:58,211
One more time!

559
00:49:58,425 --> 00:50:06,696
"Fate be changed. Look inside, mend the bond torn by pride."

560
00:50:06,697 --> 00:50:12,118
That's it. Ta ta! Oh, and thank you for shopping at the Crafty Carver!

561
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:14,733
No! Where'd you go?

562
00:50:14,734 --> 00:50:17,158
Welcome to the Crafty Carver!

563
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:17,736
What?

564
00:50:20,316 --> 00:50:22,443
Maybe there's a bit about spells, or...

565
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:24,910
...vials...

566
00:50:24,911 --> 00:50:35,165
...I'm off to the Wickerman...clock..I said...Have a lovely day!

567
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:14,073
We'll sort it out tomorrow.

568
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:05,611
My brave wee lassie, I'm here.

569
00:52:05,612 --> 00:52:08,960
I'll always be right here.

570
00:52:31,887 --> 00:52:34,007
Ehm, good morning?

571
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:39,694
So....what's all this supposed to be?

572
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:45,753
What?

573
00:52:53,726 --> 00:52:55,732
Sorry, I don't speak bear.

574
00:53:16,712 --> 00:53:18,926
Find those by the creek, didn't you?

575
00:53:19,127 --> 00:53:21,226
They're Nightshade berries.

576
00:53:23,835 --> 00:53:24,990
They're poisonous.

577
00:53:33,398 --> 00:53:37,112
Where did you get this water? It has worms!

578
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:49,742
Come on!

579
00:53:58,662 --> 00:53:59,971
Breakfast!

580
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:06,478
Oh, wait. A princess should not have weapons, in your opinion.

581
00:54:08,137 --> 00:54:09,975
There you go.

582
00:54:11,542 --> 00:54:12,168
Go on!

583
00:54:15,057 --> 00:54:18,462
How do you know you don't like it if you won't try it?

584
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,489
Where're you going?

585
00:56:41,822 --> 00:56:42,422
Mom!

586
00:56:42,923 --> 00:56:43,908
Come back!

587
00:56:57,189 --> 00:57:00,125
Mom, is that you?

588
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,872
Mom?

589
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,846
You changed.

590
00:57:14,262 --> 00:57:15,543
Like you were a...

591
00:57:16,372 --> 00:57:20,728
I mean, like you were a bear on the inside.

592
00:57:29,665 --> 00:57:31,328
A wisp!

593
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:32,589
Mom!

594
00:57:34,037 --> 00:57:35,209
Stop it!

595
00:57:37,143 --> 00:57:38,831
Mom, no!

596
00:57:41,308 --> 00:57:41,908
Mom!

597
00:57:48,012 --> 00:57:50,205
Oh, jings crivvens help ma boab!

598
00:57:50,874 --> 00:57:56,284
Mom, I know you're scared. You're tired, you don't understand.

599
00:57:56,285 --> 00:57:59,065
But we've got to keep our heads.

600
00:57:59,066 --> 00:58:02,131
Just calm down.

601
00:58:02,432 --> 00:58:03,432
Listen.

602
00:58:33,002 --> 00:58:34,472
They'll show us the way.

603
00:59:03,009 --> 00:59:05,553
Mom! Look!

604
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,545
Why did the wisps bring us here?

605
00:59:44,071 --> 00:59:46,810
Whoever they were, they've been gone for a long, long time.

606
00:59:53,803 --> 00:59:56,835
Fine, mom. Just fine.

607
01:00:06,907 --> 01:00:10,796
It's a....a throne room.

608
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:15,763
You suppose this could've been the kingdom in that story you were telling me?

609
01:00:16,919 --> 01:00:18,465
The one with the princes?

610
01:00:22,403 --> 01:00:23,004
One...

611
01:00:23,813 --> 01:00:25,081
...two...

612
01:00:26,017 --> 01:00:26,853
...three...

613
01:00:26,954 --> 01:00:27,854
...four!

614
01:00:29,053 --> 01:00:30,521
The oldest.

615
01:00:33,492 --> 01:00:35,980
Split, like the tapestry!

616
01:00:41,122 --> 01:00:44,741
The spell! It's happened before.

617
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:51,491
Strength of ten men.

618
01:00:53,046 --> 01:00:55,396
Fate be changed.

619
01:00:57,773 --> 01:00:59,653
Changed his fate.

620
01:01:01,895 --> 01:01:02,781
Oh, no.

621
01:01:03,588 --> 01:01:05,090
The prince became...

622
01:01:11,089 --> 01:01:12,447
Mor'du!

623
01:02:18,537 --> 01:02:21,145
Mom, we need to get back to the castle!

624
01:02:22,018 --> 01:02:24,891
If we don't hurry, you'll become like Mor'du!

625
01:02:24,892 --> 01:02:29,148
A bear, a real bear. Forever!

626
01:02:30,439 --> 01:02:32,999
Mend the bond torn by pride.

627
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,982
The witch gave us the answer.

628
01:02:35,183 --> 01:02:36,871
The tapestry!

629
01:02:46,702 --> 01:02:49,562
Mom! Do you have a better idea?

630
01:03:08,106 --> 01:03:09,075
That'll do.

631
01:03:22,991 --> 01:03:27,732
No more talk, no more traditions, we settle this now!

632
01:03:27,733 --> 01:03:28,834
You're the king!

633
01:03:28,869 --> 01:03:32,477
You decide which one of our sons your daughter will marry.

634
01:03:32,478 --> 01:03:35,506
None of your sons are fit to marry my daughter!

635
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:37,897
Then our alliance is over!

636
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:39,492
This means war!

637
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:45,120
Gonna murder each other!

638
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:47,729
You've got to stop them before it's too late!

639
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,664
I know, I know!

640
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:54,481
But how do we get you through there and up to the tapestry

641
01:03:54,482 --> 01:03:56,413
with the lot of them boiling over like that?

642
01:04:15,578 --> 01:04:17,377
What're you doing, lass?

643
01:04:17,378 --> 01:04:19,162
It's all right, dad.

644
01:04:20,048 --> 01:04:23,846
I..ehm..I have...

645
01:04:25,709 --> 01:04:28,702
Well, you see...I...

646
01:04:28,703 --> 01:04:31,307
I have been in conference with the Queen.

647
01:04:31,308 --> 01:04:32,540
Is that so?

648
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:34,300
Aye, it is.

649
01:04:34,301 --> 01:04:35,387
Well, where is she, then?

650
01:04:35,388 --> 01:04:36,593
She...

651
01:04:36,594 --> 01:04:38,712
How do we know that this isn't some trick?

652
01:04:38,713 --> 01:04:39,876
I'd never...

653
01:04:39,877 --> 01:04:41,118
This is highly irregular!

654
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:42,572
What're you playing at? Where is the Queen?

655
01:04:42,573 --> 01:04:45,102
We'll not stand for any more of this chiggery pie!

656
01:04:45,103 --> 01:04:46,844
That's right. Let's see her.

657
01:04:46,845 --> 01:04:48,091
SHUT IT!

658
01:04:52,066 --> 01:04:55,274
Well, I....

659
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:08,073
Once, there was an ancient kingdom.

660
01:05:08,074 --> 01:05:08,928
What is this?

661
01:05:09,856 --> 01:05:12,519
That kingdom fell into war.

662
01:05:13,293 --> 01:05:15,581
And chaos, and ruin.

663
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:18,764
Oh, we've all heard that tale. Lost kingdom.

664
01:05:18,765 --> 01:05:19,966
Aye, but it's true!

665
01:05:19,967 --> 01:05:23,896
I know now how one selfish act can turn the fate of a kingdom.

666
01:05:23,897 --> 01:05:25,579
Nah, it's just a legend.

667
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:29,565
Legends are lessons. They ring with truths.

668
01:05:30,957 --> 01:05:34,886
Our kingdom is young. Our stories are not yet legends.

669
01:05:35,187 --> 01:05:38,079
But in them are bonds we struck.

670
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,391
Our clans were once enemies.

671
01:05:40,592 --> 01:05:43,758
But when invaders threatened us from the sea,

672
01:05:43,793 --> 01:05:46,887
you joined together to defend our lands.

673
01:05:47,188 --> 01:05:52,349
You fought for each other. You risked everything for each other.

674
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:55,326
Lord MacGuffin. My dad saved your life

675
01:05:55,361 --> 01:05:58,097
stopping an arrow as you ran to Dingwall's aid.

676
01:05:58,098 --> 01:06:00,256
Aye, and I'll never forget it.

677
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:03,297
And lord Macintosh. You saved my dad

678
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:06,476
when you charged in on heavy horse and held off the advance.

679
01:06:06,477 --> 01:06:11,351
And we all know how lord Dingwall broke the enemy line...

680
01:06:11,352 --> 01:06:13,194
With a mighty throw of a spear!

681
01:06:13,195 --> 01:06:16,456
I was aiming at you, you big topsy!

682
01:06:17,366 --> 01:06:20,112
The story of this kingdom is a powerful one.

683
01:06:20,313 --> 01:06:24,927
My dad rallied your forces and you made him your king.

684
01:06:25,228 --> 01:06:29,947
It was an alliance forged in bravery and friendship.

685
01:06:29,948 --> 01:06:31,247
And it lives to this day.

686
01:06:37,096 --> 01:06:38,938
But I've been selfish.

687
01:06:39,389 --> 01:06:42,347
I tore a great rift in our kingdom.

688
01:06:43,412 --> 01:06:45,051
There's no one to blame but me.

689
01:06:46,432 --> 01:06:53,323
And I know now that I need to mend my mistake and mend our bond.

690
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:58,160
And so, there is the matter of my betrothal.

691
01:06:59,737 --> 01:07:02,652
I've decided to do what's right.

692
01:07:02,904 --> 01:07:08,904
And....and....and...

693
01:07:10,031 --> 01:07:14,705
Break...tradition.

694
01:07:19,904 --> 01:07:24,031
My mother...the Queen,

695
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:29,193
feels...in her heart,

696
01:07:29,194 --> 01:07:34,000
that I....that we

697
01:07:34,001 --> 01:07:40,925
be free to...write our own story.

698
01:07:42,438 --> 01:07:46,196
Follow...our...hearts.

699
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:51,492
And find love in our own time.

700
01:07:55,231 --> 01:07:57,964
That's beautiful.

701
01:07:57,965 --> 01:08:01,336
The Queen and I put the decision to you, my lords.

702
01:08:02,337 --> 01:08:06,092
Might our young people decide for themselves who they will love?

703
01:08:07,074 --> 01:08:10,560
Well, since you've obviously made up your minds about this

704
01:08:10,561 --> 01:08:13,553
I have one thing to say. This is...

705
01:08:13,588 --> 01:08:14,634
...a grand idea!

706
01:08:15,035 --> 01:08:17,756
Give us our own say in choosing our fate!

707
01:08:17,757 --> 01:08:18,267
What?

708
01:08:18,268 --> 01:08:21,010
Aye, why shouldn't we choose?

709
01:08:21,011 --> 01:08:23,207
But she's the princess!

710
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:26,142
I didnae pick her out, it was your idea.

711
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:29,437
And you? You feel the same way?

712
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:35,751
(unintelligible Doric accent)

713
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:43,747
Well, that settles it. Let these lads try and win her heart

714
01:08:43,748 --> 01:08:46,168
before they win her hand.

715
01:08:46,169 --> 01:08:47,662
If they can.

716
01:08:47,663 --> 01:08:50,707
I say that we, Dingwall, has a fighting chance.

717
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:54,477
Fine then, seems that once we're agreed. It was my idea in the first place.

718
01:09:06,004 --> 01:09:07,569
Just like your mom.

719
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:09,386
You devil.

720
01:09:15,617 --> 01:09:17,636
Everyone, to the cellar!

721
01:09:17,637 --> 01:09:21,938
Let's crack open the king's private reserve to celebrate!

722
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,475
Psst. Bring the tiny glasses.

723
01:09:45,032 --> 01:09:45,732
The tapestry!

724
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:50,040
Mend the bond.

725
01:09:52,278 --> 01:09:53,546
Mend the bond!

726
01:09:54,526 --> 01:09:55,864
Stitch it up!

727
01:09:55,865 --> 01:09:58,787
This'll change you back. We just need needle and thread.

728
01:10:06,455 --> 01:10:07,467
Mom?

729
01:10:09,445 --> 01:10:14,413
Mom? Not now! No, please, not now!

730
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:16,977
Mom?

731
01:10:19,984 --> 01:10:24,091
We'll boil your head with dumpling bread, to make an ursine stew.

732
01:10:25,344 --> 01:10:31,082
Elinor, dear, you'll never guess who just solved our little suitor problem.

733
01:10:43,118 --> 01:10:45,961
Elinor!

734
01:10:47,445 --> 01:10:48,622
It can't be true!

735
01:10:48,623 --> 01:10:51,001
Elinor! Answer me, lass!

736
01:10:51,002 --> 01:10:53,417
Elinor!

737
01:10:54,346 --> 01:10:55,616
Merida!

738
01:10:57,011 --> 01:10:57,406
What the...

739
01:10:57,407 --> 01:10:59,399
Dad! No! It's not what you think!

740
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,610
Merida, get back!

741
01:11:00,911 --> 01:11:01,901
No!

742
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:06,795
No!

743
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:08,420
Dad, don't hurt her!

744
01:11:11,332 --> 01:11:13,164
Merida, no!

745
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:19,645
No!

746
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:28,921
Mom!

747
01:11:33,298 --> 01:11:35,296
It's all right. I'm all right. It's nothing.

748
01:11:35,297 --> 01:11:37,881
It's just a little scratch.

749
01:11:37,882 --> 01:11:38,762
Mom!

750
01:11:39,063 --> 01:11:42,909
My liege! Fergus!

751
01:11:43,794 --> 01:11:44,894
Bear!

752
01:11:46,037 --> 01:11:46,972
Dad!

753
01:11:46,973 --> 01:11:48,298
Oh, count your stars, lass.

754
01:11:48,299 --> 01:11:50,269
It almost had you. Are you hurt?

755
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:51,786
It's your wife, Elinor!

756
01:12:00,293 --> 01:12:01,692
You're talking nonsense!

757
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:04,804
It's the truth! There was a witch and she gave me a spell.

758
01:12:04,805 --> 01:12:06,117
It's not Mor'du!

759
01:12:06,118 --> 01:12:08,154
Mor'du or not, I'll avenge your mother.

760
01:12:08,155 --> 01:12:10,465
But I'll not risk loosing you too.

761
01:12:10,466 --> 01:12:11,980
No, dad! Just listen to me!

762
01:12:11,981 --> 01:12:16,985
Listen. You can't. It's your wife Elinor!

763
01:12:16,986 --> 01:12:19,495
Maudie. Keep this. And don't let her out!

764
01:12:19,496 --> 01:12:21,105
What about the bear?

765
01:12:21,106 --> 01:12:22,568
Just stay put!

766
01:12:49,252 --> 01:12:51,529
Come on, you sorry bunch of galoots.

767
01:13:00,973 --> 01:13:01,905
Mom!

768
01:13:01,906 --> 01:13:05,767
No. No. Mom.

769
01:13:26,706 --> 01:13:27,406
Maudie.

770
01:13:28,085 --> 01:13:29,507
Maudie!

771
01:13:29,508 --> 01:13:31,347
I need you!

772
01:13:31,348 --> 01:13:32,869
Now!

773
01:13:37,932 --> 01:13:39,495
Oh, no.

774
01:13:40,535 --> 01:13:41,847
Maudie.

775
01:13:47,832 --> 01:13:48,832
Get the key!

776
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:10,928
Maudie!

777
01:14:16,957 --> 01:14:19,255
Needle and thread. Needle and thread. Needle and thread.

778
01:14:38,054 --> 01:14:39,152
There he goes!

779
01:14:39,153 --> 01:14:43,815
Needle and thread. Needle and thread. Ah, you beauty!

780
01:15:09,745 --> 01:15:10,488
One...

781
01:15:11,323 --> 01:15:12,064
...two...

782
01:15:42,508 --> 01:15:44,016
Steady, Hamish!

783
01:15:44,938 --> 01:15:46,019
There he goes!

784
01:16:04,577 --> 01:16:06,458
Back! Back! Get him! Get him!

785
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:10,649
Angus!

786
01:16:13,356 --> 01:16:14,056
No!

787
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:17,608
Hubert, Harris, help Hamish!

788
01:16:24,034 --> 01:16:25,888
Give me a hand over here!

789
01:16:59,334 --> 01:17:02,047
Get back, that's my mother!

790
01:17:02,048 --> 01:17:03,958
Are you out of your mind, lass?

791
01:17:03,959 --> 01:17:05,630
Mom, are you hurt?

792
01:17:12,602 --> 01:17:13,493
Merida!

793
01:17:16,612 --> 01:17:19,319
I'll not let you kill my mother!

794
01:17:20,706 --> 01:17:21,306
Boys!

795
01:17:23,506 --> 01:17:24,655
Boys?

796
01:17:31,055 --> 01:17:32,212
Mor'du!

797
01:17:32,213 --> 01:17:33,652
Kill it!

798
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:38,964
Scoundrel!

799
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:46,320
Come on! I'll take you with my bare hands!

800
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:21,029
Mom!

801
01:19:37,949 --> 01:19:39,451
The second sunrise!

802
01:20:18,934 --> 01:20:19,988
Oh, no.

803
01:20:22,555 --> 01:20:24,335
I don't understand, I...

804
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:36,987
Oh, mom!

805
01:20:38,162 --> 01:20:39,841
I'm sorry.

806
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,528
This is all my fault!

807
01:20:43,723 --> 01:20:45,186
I did this to you!

808
01:20:45,987 --> 01:20:46,944
To us!

809
01:20:54,237 --> 01:20:56,423
You've always been there for me.

810
01:20:57,524 --> 01:20:59,388
You've never given up on me.

811
01:21:01,515 --> 01:21:03,467
I just want you back!

812
01:21:08,915 --> 01:21:11,036
I want you back, mommy!

813
01:21:30,458 --> 01:21:32,026
I love you.

814
01:22:00,398 --> 01:22:02,845
Mom, you're back!

815
01:22:09,053 --> 01:22:10,858
You changed!

816
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:12,187
Oh, darling.

817
01:22:13,388 --> 01:22:15,598
We both have.

818
01:22:16,168 --> 01:22:17,793
Elinor!

819
01:22:22,774 --> 01:22:23,574
Elinor.

820
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:33,077
Oh, dear!

821
01:22:34,203 --> 01:22:37,325
You're back, you're back here!

822
01:22:38,683 --> 01:22:40,471
Oh, mom!

823
01:22:42,607 --> 01:22:43,507
Ehm, dear?

824
01:22:43,945 --> 01:22:46,788
I'm naked. Naked as a wee babby.

825
01:22:47,689 --> 01:22:49,893
Don't just stare at me, do something!

826
01:22:51,088 --> 01:22:53,397
What the...avert your eyes, lads!

827
01:22:53,398 --> 01:22:55,151
Show some respect!

828
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:02,836
Now that's what I call a wee naked babby!

829
01:23:06,557 --> 01:23:09,363
Merida, Elinor, hurry up, we're leaving!

01:23:09,364 --> 01:23:13,406
Mom! Hurry up! ???

831
01:23:42,993 --> 01:23:47,424
Goodbye! All the best! Fair wind to your sales!

832
01:23:53,066 --> 01:23:54,997
How did this...oh!

833
01:24:01,239 --> 01:24:04,635
There are those who say fate is something beyond our command.

834
01:24:05,477 --> 01:24:07,578
That destiny is not our own.

835
01:24:08,561 --> 01:24:10,271
But I know better.

836
01:24:12,331 --> 01:24:14,900
Our fate lives within us.

837
01:24:16,435 --> 01:24:19,633
You only have to be brave enough to see it.
