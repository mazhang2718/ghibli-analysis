<i>The neck bone's connected</i>

2
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,674
<i>To the head bone</i>

3
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,320
<i>The head bone's connected</i>
<i>to the horn bone</i>

4
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,995
<i>The horn bone's right above</i>
<i>the wing bones</i>

5
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,314
- I scared you!
- No, you didn't.

6
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,358
Okay! Remember our field trip rules,
everyone.

7
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,160
No pushing, no biting,
and no fire breathing!

8
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,279
What did I just say?

9
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,880
Eighteen, nineteen...

10
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,156
Okay, we're missing one.
Who are we missing?

11
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,672
Mike Wazowski.

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,670
Thanks, Joe.

13
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,513
Good luck finishing
your crossword puzzle.

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,673
- Sorry, Michael. I didn't see you.
- That's okay.

15
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,355
When I was on the bus, I found a nickel!

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,114
I wish I had pockets.

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,239
Okay, everyone, partner up.
Get your field trip buddy.

18
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,598
Jeremy! You and me? Okay, no biggie.

19
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,720
Hailey? No? Pairing up with Claire?
Great choice. She's a good egg.

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,115
Russell.

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,598
Mike? Wazowski?

22
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,715
We car-pool?

23
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,592
- We're cousins.
- Hey!

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,797
Okay. Good catching up.

25
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,759
Well, Michael, it looks like
it's you and me again.

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,193
Come on, Karen. We're falling behind.

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,959
Please don't call me Karen.

28
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,880
<i>Now, stay close together.</i>

29
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,954
We're entering a very dangerous area.

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,800
Welcome to the Scare Floor.

31
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,155
This is where
we collect the Scream Energy

32
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,152
to power our whole world.

33
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,438
And can anyone tell me
whose job it is to go get that scream?

34
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,831
- Scarers!
- That's right!

35
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,310
Now, which one of you can
give me the scariest roar?

36
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,636
Me, me, me!

37
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,390
Sir! Right here!
Little green guy, two o'clock!

38
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,039
No, it's like this.

39
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,474
Hey, guys, watch this one.

40
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,550
Hey, I got a really good...

41
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,909
Whoa.

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,000
Well, hey there, kids.
Are you on a tour with your school?

43
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,110
- Yeah!
- Yes.

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,194
We're here to learn about Scream
Energy and what it takes to be a Scarer.

45
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,434
Well, hey, you're in luck,
because I just happen to be a Scarer.

46
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,552
I learned everything
I know from my school,

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,359
Monsters University.

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,709
Whoa.

49
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,030
It's the best Scaring School there is.

50
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,316
You wish! Fear Tech's the best.

51
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,350
Okay. You guys watch us and tell me
which school's the best. All right?

52
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,996
MU is.

53
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,160
Let's go, everybody!

54
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,879
<i>West coast coming online.</i>

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,599
<i>Scarers coming out.</i>

56
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,075
Oops. Stop right there.

57
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,073
Don't cross over that safety line.

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,800
Human children are extremely toxic.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,480
Look at that!

60
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,871
Whoa! Hey, guys, watch the eye! Ow!

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,354
Look at that! It's amazing!

62
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,669
I know!

63
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,230
Excuse me. Fellas.

64
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,756
How about we do
tallest in the back?

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,399
Look, he's going to do a real Scare!

66
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,355
- Cool. I want to be a Scarer.
- Yeah. Me, too.

67
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,675
Come on, guys. I want to see.

68
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,840
Out of the way, Wazowski.
You don't belong on a Scare Floor.

69
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,955
Brian! Do not step over the line.

70
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,874
Mrs. Graves,
Michael went over the line.

71
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,192
Michael!

72
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,913
See? I told you. He's fine.

73
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,277
Well, I thought I heard something.

74
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,510
What?

75
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,513
Are you okay?

76
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,677
You could have gotten hurt!

77
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,510
I don't understand
how this could happen!

78
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,672
That was real dangerous, kid.
I didn't even know you were in there.

79
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,717
Wow. I didn't even know
you were in there.

80
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,954
Not bad, kid.

81
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,271
Michael, what do you have
to say for yourself?

82
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,919
How do I become a Scarer?

83
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,673
Monsters University!
Anybody getting off?

84
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,751
Well, everyone,
I don't mean to get emotional,

85
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,355
but everything in my life
has led to this moment.

86
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,159
Let it not be
just the beginning of my dream

87
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,913
but the beginning of all of our dreams.

88
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,957
Gladys, promise me
you'll keep auditioning.

89
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,111
Marie, Mr. Right
is out there somewhere.

90
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,477
Phil, keep using the ointment
till that thing goes away.

91
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,355
I wish you all the best.
Thank you all so much!

92
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,837
I'm welling up with tears. Now, get off.

93
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,360
Hello. How are you doing?

94
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,313
Stroke! Stroke!

95
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,795
Come on, put all you have into it!

96
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,194
Stroke! Stroke!

97
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,514
Okay! First thing on my list,

98
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,157
get registered.

99
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,357
Hey there, freshman. I'm Jay the R.A.,

100
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,239
and I'm here to say
that registration is thataway!

101
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,154
- Okay, Jay.
- Have a great first day.

102
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,080
Hey, I'm Kay!
Here's your orientation packet.

103
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,350
Thanks, Kay.

104
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,320
You can drop your bags off here
and get your picture taken with Trey.

105
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,113
- Say hooray!
- Hooray!

106
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,035
I can't believe it.

107
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,239
I'm officially a college student!

108
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,073
Okay, everyone, I'm Fay,

109
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,631
and I'll be giving you your
orientation tour on this perfect day!

110
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,037
Here are the labs where students learn

111
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,316
to design and build the doors
to the Human World.

112
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,680
Looks like the professor is
about to test a door!

113
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,150
The MU cafeteria serves a full buffet,
three meals a day.

114
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,397
I personally believe we have
some of the best chefs in the world.

115
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,675
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

116
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,880
The campus offers
a wide variety of majors,

117
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,671
but the crown jewel of MU
is the Scaring School.

118
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,677
Welcome to the Debate Team.
We're happy to have you.

119
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,831
I disagree for the following reasons.

120
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,400
True happiness
is a theoretical construct...

121
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,271
Hey there! Keep your eye on the sky
at the Astronomy Club!

122
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,838
Hey, hey, hey!
Come join the Improv Club.

123
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,151
You'll wish you were a...
Never... Always...

124
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,230
Ah, dang it!

125
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,156
MU's Greek Council.
We sponsor the annual Scare Games.

126
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,115
The Scare what now?

127
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,472
The Scare Games!
A super-intense Scaring competition!

128
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,473
They're crazy dangerous,
so anything could happen.

129
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,359
A bunch of guys went
to the hospital last year!

130
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,951
- You could totally die.
- And it's worth it.

131
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,994
You get a chance to prove
that you are the best!

132
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,950
Cool.

133
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,910
Wazowski, Room 319.

134
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,552
You know, your roommate
is a Scaring major, too.

135
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,470
"Hello, I'm your roommate."
Oh, that's too bland.

136
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,478
Don't force it. Just let it happen.

137
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,753
Your lifelong best friend
is right behind this door.

138
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,559
Hey there. I'm your roomie.

139
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,279
Name's Randy Boggs. Scaring major.

140
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,069
Mike Wazowski, Scaring major.

141
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,039
I can tell we're going to be
best chums, Mike.

142
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,312
Take whichever bed you want.
I wanted you to have first dibs.

143
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,954
You just disappeared.

144
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,477
Sorry. If I do that in Scaring class,
I'll be a joke.

145
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,234
No, it's totally great. You got to use it.

146
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,674
- Really?
- Yeah, but lose the glasses.

147
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,439
They give it away.

148
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,196
Okay!

149
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,199
Unpack. Check. Hang posters. Check.

150
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,715
Now I just need to ace my classes,
graduate with honors,

151
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,200
and become the greatest Scarer ever.

152
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,632
Boy, I wish I had your confidence, Mike.

153
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,313
Aren't you even a little nervous?

154
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,959
Actually, no.

155
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,191
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

156
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,829
I just can't wait to get started.

157
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,677
Oh, man! I can't be late on the first day!

158
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,510
Wow.

159
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,154
You got to be kidding me.

160
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,120
I'm so nervous!

161
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,554
Relax. It will be fine.

162
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,676
Good morning, students.

163
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,078
Welcome to Scaring 101.

164
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,074
I am Professor Knight.

165
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,791
Now I'm sure all of you
were the scariest monster in your town.

166
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,273
Well, bad news, kids.
You're in my town now,

167
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,670
and I do not scare easily.

168
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,313
Dean Hardscrabble.
This is a pleasant surprise.

169
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,750
She's a legend.

170
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,311
She broke the all-time Scare Record
with the scream in that very can!

171
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,353
I don't mean to interrupt.

172
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,999
I just thought I'd drop by

173
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,596
to see the terrifying faces
joining my program.

174
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,990
Well, I'm sure my students
would love to hear

175
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,918
a few words of inspiration.

176
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,592
Inspiration? Very well.

177
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,150
Scariness is the true measure
of a monster.

178
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,594
If you're not scary

179
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,951
what kind of a monster are you?

180
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,078
It's my job to make
great students greater,

181
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,230
not make mediocre students
less mediocre.

182
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,756
That is why at the end of the semester
there will be a final exam.

183
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,070
Fail that exam and you are
out of the Scaring program.

184
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,438
So, I should hope
you're all properly inspired.

185
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,154
All right. All right.

186
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,235
Who can tell me the properties
of an effective roar?

187
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,110
Yes?

188
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,877
There are actually five.

189
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,077
Those include the roar's resonance,

190
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,311
the duration of the roar, and the...

191
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,915
Whoops. Sorry.

192
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,834
I heard someone say "roar,"
so I just kind of went for it.

193
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,793
Oh, excuse me, sorry.

194
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,440
I didn't mean to scare you there.
Hey, how you doing?

195
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,399
Very impressive, Mister...

196
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,199
Sullivan. Jimmy Sullivan.

197
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,596
Sullivan.

198
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,751
Like Bill Sullivan, the Scarer?

199
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,599
Yeah. He's my dad.

200
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,838
He's a Sullivan!

201
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,313
I should have known.
I expect big things from you.

202
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,030
Well, you won't be disappointed.

203
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,432
I'm sorry. Should I keep going?

204
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,951
No, no. Mr. Sullivan's covered it.

205
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,111
Everyone take out
your Scaring textbooks

206
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,032
and open them to chapter one.

207
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,112
Hey, bub. Can I borrow a pencil?

208
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,793
I forgot all my stuff.

209
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,998
All right. Yes.
There we go. That will get it.

210
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,720
Yeah.

211
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,073
Come on, Mike. It's a fraternity

212
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,631
and sorority party. We have to go!

213
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,235
If we flunk that Scaring final,
we are done.

214
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,950
I'm not taking any chances.

215
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,434
You've got
the whole semester to study,

216
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,070
but this might be our only chance
to get in good with the cool kids.

217
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,879
That's why I made these cupcakes.

218
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,237
That could have been embarrassing.

219
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,792
When I'm a Scarer,
life will be a nonstop party.

220
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,996
Stay out of trouble, wild man.

221
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,116
Wild man.

222
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,230
What the...

223
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,952
Archie!

224
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,230
Hey! What are you...

225
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,834
Wait... You're shushing me?
Hey! Hey! You can't...

226
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,840
- Where did he go?
- He's dead meat.

227
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,991
- That guy's in big trouble.
- Yeah, he is.

228
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,552
Hey, guys! Over here!

229
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,360
Fear Tech dummies.

230
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,351
- Sorry about that, buddy.
- Why are you in my room?

231
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,590
Your room? This is my...

232
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,633
This is not my room.

233
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,836
Archie! Come here, boy.

234
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,956
Archie?

235
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,157
Archie the Scare Pig.
He's Fear Tech's mascot.

236
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,715
Why is it here?

237
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,996
I stole it. Going to take it to the RORs.

238
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,150
The what?

239
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,836
Roar Omega Roar.
The top fraternity on campus.

240
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,276
They only accept the highly elite.

241
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,999
Okay, I'll lift the bed, you grab the pig.

242
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,514
- Ready? One, two, three.
- What? No, no... What...

243
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,270
That's it. Don't let go.

244
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,596
Careful. He's a biter.

245
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,950
Whoa! Whoa, hey... Whoa!

246
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,476
I got him!

247
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,878
That was awesome!

248
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,919
What am I doing? James P. Sullivan.

249
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,480
Mike Wazowski.

250
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,400
Listen, it was quite delightful
meeting you

251
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,710
and whatever that is,

252
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,837
but if you don't mind,
I have to study my Scaring.

253
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,680
You don't need to study Scaring.
You just do it.

254
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,310
Really? I think there's
a little more to it than that.

255
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,160
But, hey, thanks for stopping by.

256
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,674
Let go of that!

257
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,476
- My hat!
- My pig!

258
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,834
Hey! Come here!

259
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,991
Hey!

260
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,190
Catch it!

261
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,350
Come back here!

262
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,556
Yeah!

263
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,359
Ride it to frat row!

264
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,320
<i>Tentacles and serpent's wings,</i>
<i>they...</i>

265
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,390
Hey!

266
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,112
Go, go, go!

267
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,190
Hey...

268
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,118
Come on! Hey!

269
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,436
Cupcake?

270
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,754
Got it!

271
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,590
Fear Tech's mascot! MU rules!

272
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,393
M-U! M-U! M-U!

273
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,471
Did you see him catch that pig?

274
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,677
You are Jaws Theta Chi material,
freshman.

275
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,910
Thanks. I don't know...

276
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,151
No, no, no. He's an Omega Howl guy.

277
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,675
- Back off. We saw him first.
- No way. We did!

278
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,116
I'll take it from here, gentlemen.

279
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,998
Johnny Worthington,
president of Roar Omega Roar.

280
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,756
What's your name, big blue?

281
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,792
Jimmy Sullivan. Friends call me Sulley.

282
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,391
This guy's a Sullivan?
Like the famous Sullivan?

283
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,119
I can't believe it! That is crazy!

284
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,759
- Chet, calm down.
- I'm sorry.

285
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,719
Sulley, any freshman with the guts
to pull off a stunt like that

286
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,236
has got "Future Scarer"
written all over him.

287
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,796
Hey, did you see me ride the pig?
That took guts.

288
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,396
Slow down, squirt.
This party is for Scare students only.

289
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,835
Sorry, killer,
but you might want to hang out

290
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,593
with someone a little more your speed.

291
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,478
They look fun!

292
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,071
Hey there. Want to join Oozma Kappa?

293
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,350
We have cake.

294
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,240
Go crazy.

295
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,357
Is that a joke?

296
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,114
Sulley, talk to your friend.

297
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,351
He's not really my friend, but sure.

298
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,671
You heard him.
This is a party for Scare students.

299
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,395
I am a Scare student.

300
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,552
I mean for Scare students who actually,

301
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,672
you know, have a chance.

302
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,354
Aw, snap!

303
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,196
My chances are just as good as yours.

304
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,159
You're not even
in the same league with me.

305
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,156
Just wait, hotshot.

306
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,516
I'm going to scare circles
around you this year.

307
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,712
Okay. I'd like to see that.

308
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,160
Don't worry. You will.

309
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,676
Ready position.

310
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,469
Common crouch.

311
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,679
I want to see matted fur
and yellow teeth. Basic snarl.

312
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,798
Show me some slobber.

313
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,037
Drool is a tool, kids. Use it.

314
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,076
Now here is a monster
who looks like a Scarer.

315
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,550
You want a hope of passing
this class, you better eat,

316
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,876
breathe, and sleep Scaring.

317
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,950
Yeah!

318
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,156
Give me another one.

319
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,560
- Fear of spiders.
- Arachnophobia.

320
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,960
- Fear of thunder.
- Keraunophobia.

321
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,032
- Fear of chopsticks!
- Consecotaleophobia.

322
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,759
What is this, kindergarten?
Give me a hard one.

323
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,039
Go Monsters U!
You know what to do!

324
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,075
The answer is C, fangs.

325
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,476
Well done, Mr. Wazowski.

326
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,479
- A bowl of spiders!
- Correct!

327
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,672
- A clown running in the dark!
- Right again.

328
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,832
Warts, boils, and moles, in that order.

329
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,354
Outstanding!

330
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,390
Ogre slump.

331
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,755
Zombie snarl.

332
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,997
Dominant silverback gorilla.

333
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,959
That is some remarkable
improvement, Michael.

334
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,311
One frightening face does not
a Scarer make, Mr. Sullivan.

335
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,273
A Tauntaun Grimace
with Extra Slobber.

336
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,760
- You got it!
- That's what I'm saying.

337
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,154
I am going to wipe the floor
with that little know-it-all.

338
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,799
Yes, you are, big blue.

339
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,840
Hey, wait. What are you guys...

340
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,594
It's just a precaution.

341
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,831
RORs are the best Scarers
on campus, Sullivan.

342
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,917
Can't have a member getting
shown up by a beach ball.

343
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,509
I am on a roll.

344
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,115
I'm going to destroy that guy.

345
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,512
Well, then you'll get this back
right away.

346
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,911
It's time to start delivering
on that Sullivan name.

347
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,400
Today's final will judge your ability
to assess a child's fear

348
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,639
and perform the appropriate Scare
in the Scare Simulator.

349
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,840
The Child Sensitivity Level
will be raised

350
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,833
from Bed-wetter to Heavy Sleeper,

351
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,515
so give it everything you've got.

352
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,398
Dean Hardscrabble is with us
this morning

353
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,231
to see who will be moving on
in the Scaring program

354
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,109
and who will not.

355
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,950
Let's get started.

356
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,914
I am a five-year-old girl
afraid of spiders and Santa Claus.

357
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,040
Which Scare do you use?

358
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,753
That's a Seasonal Creep and Crawl.

359
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,150
Demonstrate.

360
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,672
Results will be posted
outside my office. Next.

361
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,956
Focus.

362
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,118
Johnson, Crackle and Howl.
Yes!

363
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,394
Hey. Do you mind?

364
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,110
Don't mind at all.

365
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,473
Come on, Mike. Let's just move.

366
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,480
Stay out of my way.

367
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,917
Unlike you, I had to work hard
to get into the Scare program.

368
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,437
That's because you don't belong here.

369
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,320
That's what I thought.

370
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,789
I'm so sorry.

371
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,758
It was an accident.

372
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,199
What? This?

373
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,910
My one souvenir
from a lifetime of Scaring?

374
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,360
Accidents happen, don't they.

375
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,833
The important thing is no one got hurt.

376
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,197
You're taking this remarkably well.

377
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,951
Now, let's continue the exams.

378
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,117
Mr. Wazowski, I'm a five-year-old girl
on a farm in Kansas afraid of lightning.

379
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,874
Which Scare do you use?

380
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,753
Shouldn't I go up on the...

381
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,077
Which Scare do you use?

382
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,475
That is a Shadow Approach
with a Crackle Holler.

383
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,716
Demonstrate.

384
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,758
- Stop. Thank you.
- But I didn't get to...

385
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,274
I've seen enough.

386
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,835
I'm a seven-year-old boy...

387
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,870
I wasn't finished.

388
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,079
I don't need to know
any of that stuff to scare.

389
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,195
That "stuff" would've informed you

390
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,954
that this particular child
is afraid of snakes.

391
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,393
So a roar wouldn't make him scream,
it would make him cry,

392
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,359
alerting his parents,
exposing the monster world,

393
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,033
destroying life as we know it,

394
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,873
and of course we can't have that.

395
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,077
So I'm afraid I cannot
recommend that you continue

396
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,720
in the Scaring program. Good day.

397
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,917
Wait, what? But I'm a Sullivan.

398
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,673
Well then, I'm sure your family
will be very disappointed.

399
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,396
And, Mr. Wazowski,
what you lack is something

400
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,119
that cannot be taught.

401
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,119
You're not scary.

402
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,319
You will not be continuing
in the Scaring program.

403
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,195
Please. Let me try the simulator.
I'll surprise you.

404
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,715
Surprise me? I doubt that very much.

405
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,990
<i>Welcome back.</i>

406
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,835
<i>I hope everyone had a pleasant break.</i>

407
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,592
Some say that a career
as a scream-can designer is boring,

408
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,391
unchallenging, a waste
of a monster's potential.

409
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,158
Open your textbooks to chapter three.

410
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,199
We will now plunge into the rich history

411
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,711
of scream-can design.

412
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,869
Out of my way!

413
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,518
Coming through! Sorry.

414
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,434
<i>Welcome to this year's</i>
<i>Greek Scare Games kickoff.</i>

415
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,195
<i>The Scare Games! Yeah!</i>

416
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,351
<i>Okay, relax.</i>

417
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,514
<i>We have a special guest,</i>
<i>the founder of the games,</i>

418
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,831
<i>Dean Hardscrabble.</i>

419
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,910
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

420
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,277
<i>As a student, I created these games</i>
<i>as a friendly competition,</i>

421
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,952
<i>but be prepared.</i>

422
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,520
<i>To take home the trophy,</i>

423
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,957
<i>you must be the most fearsome</i>
<i>monsters on campus.</i>

424
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,116
<i>So good luck,</i>
<i>and may the best monsters win.</i>

425
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,475
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

426
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,914
<i>We're closing down sign-ups,</i>
<i>so we'll see you all...</i>

427
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,950
Wait!

428
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,195
I'm signing up!

429
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,600
What?

430
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,312
<i>You have to be</i>
<i>in a fraternity to compete.</i>

431
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,917
Behold the next winning fraternity
of the Scare Games,

432
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,717
the brothers, my brothers,
of Oozma Kappa!

433
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,834
Hi.

434
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,957
Mr. Wazowski, what are you doing?

435
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,550
You just said the winners are the most
fearsome monsters on campus.

436
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,115
If I win, it means
you kicked out the best Scarer

437
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,914
in the whole school.

438
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,070
That won't happen.

439
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,114
How about a little wager?

440
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,594
If I win, you let me back
in the Scaring program.

441
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,638
And what would that prove?

442
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,475
That you were wrong.

443
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,510
Very well.

444
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,755
If you win, I will let your entire team
into the Scare program.

445
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,956
But if you lose,

446
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,475
you will leave Monsters University.

447
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,714
Deal.

448
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,350
Now all you need to do is find
enough members to compete.

449
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,430
We need six guys, right?

450
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,510
<i>Sorry, chief.</i>

451
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,197
<i>We count bodies, not heads.</i>
<i>That dude counts as one.</i>

452
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,871
Anybody else want to join our team?
Anyone at all?

453
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,076
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm late.

454
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,550
- Can I squeeze by you?
- Randy!

455
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,438
Randy, thank goodness.
I need you on my team.

456
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,315
Sorry. I'm already on a team.

457
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,390
Boggs.

458
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,711
I'm finally in with the cool kids, Mike.

459
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,393
Don't blow this for me.

460
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,076
Do the thing.

461
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,313
Where did he go?

462
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,636
Please, anybody.

463
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,916
I need one more monster.
Just one more!

464
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,993
<i>Yeah, sorry. Doesn't look good.</i>

465
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,515
<i>We have to move on.</i>
<i>Your team doesn't qualify.</i>

466
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,920
Yes, it does!

467
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,357
The star player has just arrived.

468
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,435
No way! Someone else!
Please! Anyone else.

469
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,076
<i>We're shutting down sign-ups, okay?</i>
<i>Is he on your team or not?</i>

470
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,434
Come on! Let's go!

471
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,233
Fine! Yes, he's on my team.

472
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,476
Good luck.

473
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,435
All right, Wazowski, what's the plan?

474
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,552
This is a fraternity house?

475
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,395
Hey there, teammateys!
Come on aboard!

476
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,391
As the president of Oozma Kappa,

477
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,200
it is my honor to welcome you
to your new home.

478
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,791
We call this room "Party Central."

479
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,197
Technically, we haven't
actually had a party here yet.

480
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,636
But when we do, we'll be ready!

481
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,397
The hot cocoa train is coming through!

482
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,312
Next stop... You!

483
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,437
I would like to start us off first by...

484
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,837
So, you guys are Scaring majors?

485
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,239
We were! None of us lasted very long.

486
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,711
I guess we just weren't what
old Hardscrabble was looking for.

487
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,792
Don Carlton, mature student.

488
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,871
Thirty years in the textile industry

489
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,152
and then old dandy Don got downsized.

490
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,152
Figured I could throw myself
a pity party,

491
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,311
or go back to school
and learn the computers.

492
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,276
Hello. I'm Terry with a "Y"...

493
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,319
And I'm Terri with an "l"!
I'm a dance major!

494
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,595
And I'm not.

495
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,592
Five, six, seven, eight!

496
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,070
Seven, eight, turn! And...
Why didn't you turn?

497
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,913
Because we never agreed to do this!

498
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,669
- You said this was going to be cool!
- No one said this was gonna be cool.

499
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,989
- Now I'm embarrassed.
- Now you're embarrassed?

500
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,434
Yes, because it's in front of people!

501
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,920
You should wake up embarrassed.

502
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,195
Hey, hey, hey!

503
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,434
I'm Art! New Age philosophy major.

504
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,751
Excited to live with you
and laugh with you,

505
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,114
and cry with you.

506
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,956
Thought you might like
to keep a dream journal.

507
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,429
Guess that leaves me.

508
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,954
My name's Scott Squibbles.

509
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,599
My friends call me Squishy.

510
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,831
I'm undeclared, unattached,

511
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,550
and unwelcome pretty much
everywhere but here.

512
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,271
Now that we've all been introduced,
as captain of our team...

513
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,000
So, basically, you guys have
no Scaring experience?

514
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,034
Not a lot! But now we've got you!

515
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,630
You're about the scariest fella
I've ever seen.

516
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,313
Even with them pink polka dots.

517
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,436
Thanks.

518
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,759
Actually, I think I bring
the whole package.

519
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,354
Your hands are as big as my face!

520
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,875
He's like a mountain with fur!

521
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,317
Come on. I don't even work out.

522
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,837
Yeah, me neither.
I don't want to get too big.

523
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,633
We thought our dreams were over,
but Mike said if we win,

524
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,234
they're letting us
in the Scaring program.

525
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,358
We're going to be real Scarers!

526
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,319
- The best!
- You betcha!

527
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,039
Yeah! Right.

528
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,829
And here's what you've been
waiting for, fellas.

529
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,071
Your very own Oozma Kappa bedroom.

530
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,312
Great! We're sharing this room?

531
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,153
We'll let you guys get settled.

532
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,675
Anything you need,
you just give a big holler-oonie!

533
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,639
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Are you kidding me?

534
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,276
Look, they don't need to be good.
I'm going to carry the whole team.

535
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,717
Really? And who's going to carry you?

536
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,514
Hey, if you want to go back
to can design,

537
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,875
you know where the door is.

538
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,749
Great.

539
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,276
Guys?

540
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,600
Anybody home?

541
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,314
Hello?

542
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,156
Fellas?

543
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,877
Do you pledge your souls
to the Oozma Kappa brotherhood?

544
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,719
- Do you swear to keep secret...
- ...all that you learn here?

545
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,554
No matter how horrifying?

546
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,955
Hey!

547
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,192
Will you take the sacred oath of the...

548
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,277
- For crying out loud.
- Sweetie!

549
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,238
Turn the lights on
while you're down here!

550
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,800
You're going to ruin your eyes!

551
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,800
Mom! We're doing an initiation!

552
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,959
Scary. Well, carry on.

553
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,997
Just pretend I'm not here.

554
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,196
This is my mom's house.

555
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,992
Do you promise to look out
for your brothers...

556
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,399
...no matter what the peril?

557
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,800
Will you defend Oozma Kappa
no matter how dangerous?

558
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,237
No matter how insurmountable
the odds may be?

559
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,920
From evils both great and small?

560
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,276
In the face of unending pain and...

561
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,800
Forget it! You're in.

562
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,158
Look, we know we're no one's
first choice for a fraternity,

563
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,516
so it means a lot
to have you here with us.

564
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,480
Can't wait to start Scaring
with you, brothers.

565
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,358
- Time for a celebration!
- Yeah!

566
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,076
Grab the couch cushions, gentlemen,
because we're building a fort!

567
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,712
Mom, can we stay up late tonight?

568
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,440
I know you're a princess
and I'm just a stable boy.

569
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,320
Yuck!

570
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,197
- Mom! What are you doing?
- Your grubby paw was in my bed!

571
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,634
Were you kissing my hand?

572
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,520
No. And what about you
with all your shedding?

573
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,080
- I don't shed.
- Really.

574
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,070
Uh...

575
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,714
- Excuse me.
- I just want to get my stuff.

576
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,836
- Would you just...
- Hey. Come on!

577
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,320
...let me get my stuff!

578
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,314
First morning in the house.

579
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,113
That's going in the album!

580
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,079
- Guys! We got a letter!
- A letter?

581
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,640
We never get mail.

582
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,030
- Sorry. It's stuck.
- Would you... Give me that!

583
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,400
Tentacles. They're sticky.

584
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,676
It's the first event
of the Scare Games.

585
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,351
"A child's room is where you scare,

586
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,000
"but avoid the toxicity lurking there."

587
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,276
Wait a minute.
Where do they want us to meet?

588
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,753
Of all the sewers on campus,
this one has always been my favorite.

589
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,240
Art, you've been here before?

590
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,040
I have a life outside of the house,
you know.

591
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,192
Welcome to your worst nightmare,

592
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,794
the Scare Games!

593
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,432
Scare Games! Scare Games!

594
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,314
Yes! Yes, I love it!

595
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,234
I love this energy!

596
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,719
Okay. Okay, everybody.

597
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,360
Let's hear it
for the frats and sororities

598
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,797
competing in this year's games...

599
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,793
Jaws Theta Chi!

600
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,958
Python Nu Kappa!

601
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,350
Slugma Slugma Kappa!

602
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,836
Roar Omega Roar!

603
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,630
Eta Hiss Hiss!

604
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,039
And finally, Oozma Kappa.

605
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,200
Hi, Mom!

606
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,154
Smile!

607
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,876
Let's begin the first competition,

608
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,839
the Toxicity Challenge!

609
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,674
Human children are toxic!

610
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,591
And anything they touch is toxic.

611
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,797
We don't have any human toys,

612
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,510
but thanks to MU's biology department,

613
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,432
we found a close second,

614
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,873
the stinging glow urchin!

615
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,236
Trust me when I say,

616
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,198
you are not gonna
want to touch this bad boy!

617
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,510
I want to touch it.

618
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,953
And you certainly don't want
to touch any of its friends.

619
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,396
Yeah, I want to touch them.

620
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,439
This is the starting line.

621
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,797
The light at the end of the tunnel
is the finish line.

622
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,556
And whoever comes in last
is eliminated from the games.

623
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,393
- Mike...
- What is it?

624
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,716
Does that mean if we lose, we're out?

625
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,314
- Don't worry, Smoothie.
- Squishy!

626
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,914
Squishy. We're not going to lose,

627
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,716
because we have everything
we need to win right here.

628
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,430
Heart.

629
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,473
No! Me. I'm going to win the race for us.

630
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,074
All right, all right. That's very cute,

631
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,231
but move, move, move.
I'm going to win this.

632
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,471
It's an obstacle course.
What are you going to do? Roar at it?

633
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,638
I can get through
faster than you, little guy.

634
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,470
Take your place at the starting line!

635
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,758
This is all about teamwork.

636
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,277
Everybody, stick together.

637
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,516
I'm going to beat you
over that finish line.

638
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,000
Get ready to eat my dust.

639
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,833
Hey, guys, should we huddle up?

640
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,518
Attention, teams. One last thing.

641
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,432
Scarers work in the dark.

642
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,318
- I want to go home!
- On your marks...

643
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,719
Hey, good luck, ladies.

644
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,554
Thanks! We're going to
rip you to pieces!

645
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,717
What?

646
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,990
...get set...

647
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,432
Go!

648
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,875
I'm going to touch them!

649
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,476
Come on!

650
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,515
Guys! We're falling behind a little!
Fellas!

651
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,030
Cheese and crackers!

652
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,440
Son of a moustache!

653
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,513
Salisbury steak, that hurts!

654
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,109
Is that as fast as you can go?

655
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,793
- Just getting started!
- What the...

656
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,669
That's got to hurt!

657
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,200
Terry!

658
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,079
Don't worry, we'll be...

659
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,680
Yikes!

660
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,873
Roar Omega Roar wins!

661
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,552
Take that, Wazowski!

662
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,559
Are you delirious? I beat you!

663
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,075
Get your eye checked!

664
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,590
Way to blow it, Oozmas!

665
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,713
Hey! Second place ain't bad.

666
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,473
Second place, Jaws Theta Chi!

667
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,550
What?

668
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,309
Your whole team
has to cross the finish line.

669
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,630
Third place, EEKs!

670
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,234
- Fourth place, PNKs!
- No.

671
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,640
- Fifth place, HSS!
- No, no, no!

672
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,915
And in last place,

673
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,592
Oozma Kappa.

674
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,277
I can't feel my anything.

675
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,718
Shocker! Oozma Kappa
has been eliminated!

676
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,556
No.

677
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,709
Don't look so surprised, Mr. Wazowski.

678
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,437
It would have taken a miracle
for you to...

679
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,751
Attention, everyone.
We have an announcement.

680
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,753
Jaws Theta Chi has been disqualified.

681
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,394
The use of illegal protective gel
is cause for elimination.

682
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,755
What!

683
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,839
Which means Oozma Kappa
is back in the games!

684
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,794
It's a miracle!

685
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,151
Your luck will run out, eventually.

686
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,951
This is going to be
harder than I thought.

687
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,550
Okay! Listen up, Oozmas.

688
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,597
Now, we're going to have to start
winning these things together,

689
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,395
so that means I'm going to need

690
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,073
each of you guys
to pull your own weight.

691
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,389
- Mike?
- What is it?

692
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,756
We've made a list of
our strengths and weaknesses.

693
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,038
In high school, I was
the master of the silent scare.

694
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,552
I could sneak up on a field mouse
in a pillow factory.

695
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,916
Sorry! They get stickier
when I'm sweaty.

696
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,638
Oh, my gosh, that's terrible.

697
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,997
We're experts in the ancient craft
of close-up magic.

698
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,879
It's all about misdirection.

699
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,080
I have an extra toe.

700
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,310
Not with me, of course.

701
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,760
Guys, one slip-up on the next event,
and we're goners.

702
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,910
So for this to work,

703
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,674
I'm gonna need you
to take every instinct you have

704
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,240
and bury it deep, deep down.

705
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,631
- Done.
- From now on, we are of one mind.

706
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,710
My mind.

707
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,870
Please.

708
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,077
I will tell you exactly what to do,
and how to do it.

709
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,352
Okay, Mike. Seems about right.

710
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,915
All right. Give me scary steps.

711
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,912
Fifty up and down, right now. Let's go!

712
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,674
You're wasting your time.
We need a new team.

713
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,480
We can't just "get a new team"!

714
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,040
I checked this morning.
It's against the rules.

715
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,278
What if we disguised a new team
to look like the old team?

716
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,193
No, no. We are not cheating.

717
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,036
It's not cheating. I'm just, you know,
leveling the playing field.

718
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,356
Okay, so it's kind of cheating,
but what do you want me to do?

719
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,999
They're not exactly
the scariest group in the world.

720
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,713
Oh, a ladybug!
Make a wish! Make a wish!

721
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,034
This is not going to work.

722
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,759
Where are you going? We're training.

723
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,876
I'm a Sullivan.

724
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,992
That's not enough.
You're all over the place.

725
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,070
You're charging ahead when you...

726
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,791
You tell them what to do but not me.

727
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,519
So long, Coach.

728
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,840
Okay, Oozmas...

729
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,795
Boy, we need to get you a bell.

730
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,550
Listen up. "If a kid hears you coming,
they'll call Mom or Dad,

731
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,632
"then you'd better run fast
or things will get bad."

732
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,072
In the next event,
if even one of us gets caught,

733
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,719
we're all out.

734
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,395
So remember, do exactly what I do.

735
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,352
We are at
the halfway point of the second event,

736
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,276
and things are getting interesting.

737
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,195
Got it.

738
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,515
Only two teams left.

739
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,873
Who will make it out with their flag,

740
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,593
and who will be eliminated?

741
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,670
In a real Scare,

742
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,350
you do not want to get caught
by a kid's parent.

743
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,558
And in this event,
you do not want to get caught by

744
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,109
the librarian.

745
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,999
Quiet.

746
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,272
What's so scary
about a little old librarian?

747
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,116
I said, "Quiet."

748
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,392
- Faster.
- Slow and steady.

749
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,278
- Slow and steady.
- Slow and steady.

750
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,396
Slow and steady.

751
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,160
Slow and steady.

752
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,837
- Sullivan!
- Sullivan!

753
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,073
No!

754
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,875
Five, six, seven, eight!

755
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,076
Look over here!

756
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,797
- Is that legal?
- You better believe it, mop top!

757
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,031
The only rule is don't get caught.

758
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,240
Hey! Over here!

759
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,353
- Come and get me!
- Come and get me!

760
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,476
Guys, what are you doing?

761
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,710
They said don't let her catch you.

762
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,314
But they didn't say how!

763
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,920
Move it! Move it! Move it! Come on!

764
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,310
We did it!

765
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,155
No, we didn't. We forgot the flag!

766
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,640
Mike?

767
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,713
- Way to go, Squishy!
- Way to go, Squishy!

768
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,030
How?

769
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,112
Misdirection.

770
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,557
The EEKs have been eliminated

771
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,951
and Oozma Kappa live
to scare another day!

772
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,631
We're OK! We're OK! We're OK!

773
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,913
I've never felt so alive!

774
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,070
We were awesome!

775
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,356
Okay, look. That wasn't real Scaring.

776
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,069
It was better than what you did.

777
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,560
You should've stuck to my strategy.

778
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,870
Whatever.

779
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,599
Talk to me when we start
the real Scaring.

780
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,471
Hey! You guys going to the party?

781
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,713
I think you've got the wrong guys.

782
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,757
- We don't get invited to...
- Party?

783
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,593
The mid-games mixer at the RORs'.

784
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,717
It's for the top Scare Teams.

785
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,916
You're one of us now, right?

786
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,476
See you there!

787
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,752
- Did you hear that?
- I can't believe it!

788
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,638
- Bad idea.
- This is great.

789
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,316
They're finally seeing us
as real Scarers. We're going!

790
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,512
Do young people still dance?

791
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,274
Because my moves are a little rusty.

792
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,238
We forgot to bring a hostess gift.

793
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,039
We can't go in there
without some scented candles.

794
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,835
Calm down. We earned this.

795
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,913
What if there's
a lull in the conversation?

796
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,992
I never know what to... You know...

797
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,190
Say?

798
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,840
How are you so good at this?

799
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,032
You just took on
an angry 50-foot librarian,

800
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,998
and you're afraid of a little party?

801
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,309
Take a deep breath...

802
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,790
...and in you go!

803
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,516
Hello.

804
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,391
- It's Oozma Kappa!
- These guys are crazy!

805
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,631
What you did today was insane!

806
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,870
That was awesome!

807
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,039
Oozma Kappa,
tonight we party like Scarers!

808
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,314
I've never stayed up this late in my life!

809
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,910
Hey, quiet! Quiet!

810
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,154
Quiet down, you can-wranglers.

811
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,672
All right. On behalf of the RORs,

812
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,357
we'd like to congratulate all the teams
that have made it this far.

813
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,190
All, right, let's hear it for the PNKs!

814
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,911
I love that trick! Never gets old. HSS!

815
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,630
Very creepy.

816
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,999
And finally, the surprise team
of the Scare Games,

817
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,876
Oozma Kappa!

818
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,430
Come on over, guys.

819
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,840
Now, I got to admit, fellas,

820
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,351
I thought you were a bunch of nobodies.

821
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,640
But, boy, was I wrong.

822
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,998
Let's hear it for Oozma Kappa!

823
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,197
Oozma Kappa!

824
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,396
Oh!

825
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,030
What?

826
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,273
The most adorable monsters
on campus.

827
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,119
Release the stuffed animals.

828
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,710
Faced!

829
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,311
Don't worry.
Nobody reads the school paper.

830
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,915
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
they read the quad.

831
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,956
Thank you very much.

832
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,599
Okay. Would you like that
with two sleeves or four?

833
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,909
Thanks. Tell your friends.

834
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,514
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

835
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,795
Raising a little money for charity.

836
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,315
Yeah? Well, stop it.

837
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,990
You want us to stop raising money
for charity? That's not cool.

838
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,434
This guy hates charity!

839
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,476
I want you to stop making us
look like fools.

840
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,440
Hey, you're making yourselves
look like fools.

841
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,274
Let's be honest, boys.

842
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,317
You're never going to be real Scarers,

843
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,199
because real Scarers look like us.

844
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,551
But, hey, if you really want
to work for a Scare company

845
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,799
they're always hiring in the mailroom.

846
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,476
Guys, hold on!

847
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,114
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a second.
Don't listen to him.

848
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,919
We just need to keep trying.

849
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,117
No, you need to stop trying!

850
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,556
You can train monsters like this
all you want,

851
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,154
but you can't change who they are.

852
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,150
Mike...

853
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,311
We appreciate everything you've done,
but he's right.

854
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:58,000
No matter how much we train,
we'll never look like them.

855
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,510
We're built

856
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,116
for other things.

857
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,436
Sorry, squirt!

858
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,876
Some monsters just aren't
cut out for the big leagues.

859
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,040
The big leagues.

860
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,750
Guys.

861
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,033
We're going on a little field trip.

862
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,354
My tentacle fell asleep.

863
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,393
- Thanks, Mom.
- Have fun, kids!

864
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,194
I'll just be here listening to my tunes.

865
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,515
Hey, where are we?

866
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,954
The big leagues.

867
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,834
Holy roly-poly.

868
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,990
Wow.

869
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,639
Nice fence.

870
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,200
This is amazing, Mike.

871
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,394
We're not stopping here.

872
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,637
This is crazy.
We're going to get arrested!

873
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,311
<i>All Scare Floors now active.</i>

874
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,156
<i>West coast coming online.</i>
<i>Scarers coming out.</i>

875
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,110
Look at them.

876
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,834
They're going into the human world,

877
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,032
and they don't even look scared!

878
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,556
Wow.

879
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,558
Take a good look, fellas.

880
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,879
See what they all have in common?

881
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,119
No, not really.

882
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,637
Exactly. There's no one type of Scarer.

883
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,032
The best Scarers use their differences
to their advantage.

884
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,875
- Wow.
- Terri? Look.

885
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,796
Hey!

886
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,634
Look at that old feller
racking up the big numbers!

887
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,872
Don, that old fella is
Earl "The Terror" Thompson!

888
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,395
What? Where? That's really him?

889
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,676
He held the Scare Record
for three years!

890
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,872
Third door from the end!

891
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,316
Carla "Killer Claws" Benitez!

892
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,517
Look!
It's "Screaming" Bob Gunderson!

893
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,513
- I still have his rookie card.
- Me, too!

894
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,920
Doesn't have the speed anymore,
but his

895
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,390
- technique is flawless.
- Technique is flawless.

896
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,353
You collected Scare Cards, huh?

897
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,193
Yep. 450 of them.

898
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,079
Impressive.
I have 6,000 still in mint condition,

899
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,674
but, you know, 450 is pretty good, too.

900
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,070
Hey, look at me!
I'm Earl "The Terror" Thompson!

901
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,835
That's great!

902
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,477
That's a pretty good one, Squish.

903
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,715
I've been a real jerk.

904
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,475
So have l.

905
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,796
But it's not too late.

906
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,194
We could be a great team.
We just need to start working together.

907
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,710
Hey!

908
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,710
What are you doing up there?

909
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,715
I can't go back to jail!

910
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,030
Come on!

911
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,520
They're right behind us!

912
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,630
Get back here!

913
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,550
Up there! Get them!

914
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,193
- Thanks, brother!
- Don't mention it.

915
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:56,154
I'm fine, really!
It's just a little heart attack.

916
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,677
I want a piece of that action!

917
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,995
Mom! Start the car!

918
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,312
- What?
- Start the car!

919
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,755
Stop the bar?

920
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,917
The car! Start the car!

921
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,310
Okay.

922
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,874
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

923
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:24,950
Get in! Get in!

924
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,272
- Mom, go!
- Seatbelts.

925
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,511
- Okay, go!
- Does anyone want gum?

926
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,590
Just drive!

927
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,555
Okay. Here we go!

928
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,472
Oh, yeah!
Let's break in somewhere else!

929
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,552
Rise and shine!

930
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,799
Scary feet, scary feet...
The kid is in the bathroom!

931
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,758
Scary feet, scary feet...
Oh, he's back!

932
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:14,710
Wake up!

933
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,754
Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight!

934
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,038
Do I hear thirty-nine?
Come on!

935
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,592
Yes! Okay, Oozma Kappa,
you're looking good.

936
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,118
"To frighten a child
is the point of a Scare.

937
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,999
"If you frighten a teen,
then Scarer beware."

938
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,796
Okay, scare the little kid.

939
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,155
Avoid the teenager!

940
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,520
I'm on the phone!

941
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,876
No one understands me!

942
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,076
Whatever.

943
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,674
But, Daddy, I love him!

944
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,153
<i>First place, Roar Omega Roar!</i>

945
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,232
<i>Second place, Oozma Kappa!</i>

946
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,149
<i>Third place, HSS.</i>

947
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,475
You're lame.

948
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,279
"Someone is coming,
this could ruin your night.

"Stay hidden, take cover,
and stay out of sight!"

950

You got 10 seconds. Go!

951
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,513
Kiosk! Pile of leaves!
Standing out in the open.

952
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,469
And there should be one more.

953
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,517
How did I do?

954
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,275
Not too shabby, Don!

955
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,757
Thanks! I cannot get down.

956
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,515
Zombie snarl!

957
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,592
Angry poodle. Jazz clown.

958
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,796
My Aunt Phyllis.

959
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,916
In the morning.

960
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,235
That's what I'm talking about!

961
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,397
Time to go to work.

962
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,270
You're out!

963
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:16,990
You're out.

964
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,272
Hey, tough luck, Kris Kringle.

965
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,029
Thank you.

966
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,635
Yeah!

967
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,430
Yeah!

968
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,835
<i>We're down to two remaining teams,</i>

969
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,992
<i>Roar Omega Roar and Oozma Kappa!</i>

970
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,193
Which leads us to the final event!

971
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,789
"Every one of your skills
will be put to the test.

972
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,477
"The Scare Simulator will prove
who's the best!"

973
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,156
Tomorrow night you finally get to Scare

974
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,874
in front of the whole school!

975
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,600
Enjoy the attention while it lasts, boys.

976
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:07,478
After you lose,
no one will remember you.

977
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:11,669
Maybe. But when you lose,
no one will let you forget it.

978
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:16,072
Oh, boy. That is a good point.

979
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,714
Hey, Oozmas, you guys are awesome!

980
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,757
You've got to teach us your moves.

981
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,480
Well, then you're gonna
want to talk to this guy.

982
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,797
Sure, I can teach you.

983
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,439
All right. You want to hide
behind the chair?

984
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,556
You have to become the chair.

985
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,199
Thanks for coming, Dean.

986
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,110
Dean Hardscrabble!

987
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,880
If we get back into the Scaring program,

988
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,235
I hope there's no hard feelings.

989
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,029
Tomorrow, each of you must prove
that you are undeniably scary.

990
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,712
And I know for a fact
that one of you is not.

991
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,038
No. He works harder than anyone.

992
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,436
Do you think he's scary?

993
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,160
He's the heart and soul of the team!

994
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,357
Do you think he's scary?

995
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,916
We're going to win this thing
tomorrow, Sull, I can feel it!

996
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,631
We'll finally have our lives
back on track.

997
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,709
Hey, Mike?

998
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,998
You know, you've given me
a lot of really great tips.

999
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,594
I'd love to return the favor sometime.

1000
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,317
Yeah, sure. Anytime.

1001
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,915
- We're doing this now?
- Okay.

1002
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,671
You've memorized every textbook,
every Scare Theory, and that is great.

1003
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,114
Hey!

1004
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,919
But now it's time to forget all that.

1005
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,038
Just reach deep down
and let the scary out!

1006
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,914
Just feel it.

1007
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,469
Exactly. Go wild.

1008
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,911
I don't know. I've kind of
got my own technique.

1009
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,350
Give it a try.

1010
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,874
Good, but bigger!

1011
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,831
Nope. You're thinking again.
From the gut!

1012
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,315
Let the animal out!

1013
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,594
Come on! Dig deep!

1014
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,755
Boys! It's a school night!

1015
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,753
So, how was that?

1016
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,355
Up top.

1017
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,871
You know, it did feel different!
I feel like it's all coming together.

1018
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,873
Yup, this time tomorrow
the whole school is finally going to see

1019
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,758
what Mike Wazowski can do.

1020
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,399

Okay, just like we planned.
I'll go first. Then, Don...

1037
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,397
Hold on. Mike's the one
who started all this

1038
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,600
and I think it's only right
if he's the one who finishes it.

1039

Yes!

Yeah, Mike. Finish strong!

Go Oozmas!

1046

I'm gonna do it.
I'm going to beat this guy.

Hey, Bruiser!
You take it easy on grandpa.

Don't worry about Hardscrabble.

Don't worry about anyone else.

Why? Why did you do this?

You know, just in case.

1116

In case of what?

1117
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,040
You don't think I'm scary.

1118

- Mike...
- You said you believed in me.

1119
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,275
But you're just like Hardscrabble.
You're just like everyone else!

1120
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,676
Look, you'll get better and better...

1121

I'm as scary as you!
I'm as scary as anyone!

01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,159
- I just wanted to help.
- No.

1123
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:55,754
You just wanted to help yourself.

1124
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,030
Well, what was I supposed to do?

1125
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,430
Let the whole team fail
because you don't have it?

1126
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,391
So your calculations were a little off.

1127
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,153
That door took me all semester.

1128
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,119
It's too dangerous.
The professor's just going to shred it.

1129
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,878
There he is, the big guy.

1130
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,350
The first of many trophies, I am sure.

1131
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,190
Sullivan.

1132
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,239
Nice work out there.

1133
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,039
I look forward to having you
back in class.

1134
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,200
Hey, there he is!

1135
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,716
Looks like I was wrong about you.

1136
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,075
You're one of us after all.

1137
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:09,194
Way to go, Sulley!
Welcome back, broham!

1138
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,232
You are one of us now, okay?

1139
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,712
Anytime you want to come hang out
and do whatever, you got a crew.

1140
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,839
You're a ROR, buddy!

1141
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:19,910
Hey!

1142
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,795
Where are you going?

1143
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,115
You did what?

1144
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,159
My team had nothing to do with it.

1145
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,039
It was all me. I cheated.

1146
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,191
I expect you off campus by tomorrow.

1147
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,796
Yes, ma'am.

1148
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,030
You're a disgrace to this university

1149
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,351
and your family name.

1150
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,670
What's going on?

1151
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,160
Someone broke into the door lab!

1152
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,470
What?

1153
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,670
Oh, no.

1154
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,871
Open the door! Don't go in there!

1155
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,396
You look funny.

1156
01:18:58,960 --> 01:18:59,950
What?

1157
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,952
I'm so tired. What's going on?

1158
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,190
It's the middle of the night.

1159
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,480
A little funny green guy.

1160
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,514
I want to touch it! It's so cute!

1161
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,196
James!

1162
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,393
No one goes near that door
until the authorities arrive.

1163
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:36,750
You don't think that could be...

1164
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,877
- It's Mike.
- But he could die out there!

1165
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,635
James, wait! We can help.

1166
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:47,192
Leave it to the old master of sales.

1167
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,316
We got a call in,
but that's the best we can do.

1168
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,911
Don Carlton, sales.
Folks, today is your lucky day.

1169
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,595
How many times have you asked
yourself the following question...

1170
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,400
- Arrest him.
- Pardon?

1171
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:00,630
Spread them, pops!

1172
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,320
- Do you mind?
- Don't move!

1173
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,430
What? Sullivan!

1174
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,876
Don't you dare!

1175
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:06,869
Sullivan! Don't go in there!

1176
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,676
Mike?

1177
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,433
Mike!

1178
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,591
The kids said
they saw something in the cabin.

1179
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,911
- They're calling it an alien.
- It was!

1180
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,356
I saw a little green guy!

1181
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,835
What's the problem, ma'am?

1182
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,510
Mike?

1183
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,600
Bear! A bear in the camp!

1184
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,276
Down this way. All right?

1185
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,953
I heard something over here!

1186
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,594
Mike!

1187
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,193
Come on, buddy.
Let's get you out of here.

1188
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,233
This is all my fault. I'm sorry.

1189
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,432
You were right.
They weren't scared of me.

1190
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,272
I did everything right.

1191
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,432
I wanted it more than anyone.

1192
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:32,192
And I thought...
I thought if I wanted it enough,

1193
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,039
I could show everybody that...

1194
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,709
That Mike Wazowski
is something special.

1195
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:41,640
And I'm just

1196
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,516
not.

1197
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,952
Look, Mike, I know how you feel.

1198
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,032
Don't do that! Please, don't do that!

1199
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,680
- You do not know how I feel.
- Mike, calm down.

1200
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,236
Monsters like you have everything.
You don't have to be good.

1201
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,596
You can mess up over and over again

1202
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,194
- and the whole world loves you.
- Mike...

1203
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:07,830
You'll never know what it's like to fail
because you were born a Sullivan!

1204
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,999
Yeah, I'm a Sullivan.
I'm the Sullivan who flunked every test.

1205
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,355
The one who got kicked out
of the program,

1206
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,911
the one who was so afraid
to let everyone down

1207
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,275
that I cheated.

1208
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,755
And I lied.

1209
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,591
Mike, I'll never know how you feel,

1210
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,232
but you're not the only failure here.

1211
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:35,992
I act scary, Mike, but most of the time

1212
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,914
I'm terrified.

1213
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,158
How come you never
told me that before?

1214
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,236
Because

1215
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,552
we weren't friends before.

1216
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,716
Check the lake!

1217
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,231
I heard something here!

1218
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,234
This way!

1219
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,560
I saw movement!

1220
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,156
Over there!

1221
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,830
Sulley!

1222
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,790
He's cornered!

1223
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,189
No!

1224
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,070
They're still in there!

1225
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:59,079
Until the authorities arrive,
this door stays off!

1226
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,795
No! You can't do that! No!

1227
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,477
Enough! I want this room cleared now!

1228
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,194
You can't do this!

1229
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,234
We got to get out of here!

1230
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,833
- Let them come.
- What?

1231
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,912
If we scare them,
I mean really scare them,

1232
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,879
we could generate enough scream
to power the door from this side!

1233
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,190
What are you talking about?

1234
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,953
I have read every book
about Scaring ever written.

1235
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,030
This could work!

1236
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,680
They're adults. I can't do this.

1237
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,360
Yes, you can. Just follow my lead.

1238
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,556
<i>Mama!</i>

1239
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,230
<i>Mama!</i>

1240
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,751
<i>Mama...</i>

1241
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,236
What the...

1242
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,199
- Now what?
- Phase two.

1243
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,154
Keep together.

1244
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,155
Are you ready?

1245
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,078
- Mike, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1246
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,152
Stop being a Sullivan
and start being you.

1247
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,036
Call for backup.

1248
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,429
Assistance on the north side.

1249
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,996
Repeat, we need assistance
on the north side.

1250
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,833
<i>Ranger,</i>
<i>answer me, what's your 20?</i>

1251
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,435
We need assistance on the north side.
We have a...

1252
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,829
Look! What was it?

1253
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,149
Let's go.

1254
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:44,470
Sulley, come on!

1255
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,950
How?

1256
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,834
How did you do this?

1257
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,235
Don't ask me.

1258
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,232
Move, move, move!
This is a 54-23 in progress.

1259
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:28,470
All right, everybody, clear out.

1260
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,274
Secure the perimeter.

1261
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,477
No child breach.
no child breach.

1262
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,229
You ruined our doors!

1263
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,596
I've been working on my door
all semester!

1264
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:37,670
Let's go, you two.

1265
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,111
- You're alive!
- We are so glad you're safe.

1266
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,916
Hey, wait!

1267
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:45,990
What's going to happen to them?

1268
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:49,152
That's for the university president
to decide.

1269
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,834
But you can be sure
we'll be watching these two.

1270
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,832
Always watching.

1271
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,316
- Expelled?
- Yeah, we really messed up.

1272
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,999
So, you're leaving?

1273
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,556
Yeah, buddy. We have to go.

1274
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,954
Harsh, man.

1275
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,669
I'm sorry, guys.
You'd be in the Scaring program

1276
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:14,876
right now if it wasn't for us.

1277
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,030
What?

1278
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,556
Well, it is
the gosh-darnedest thing.

1279
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,632
Hardscrabble's letting us
into the Scare program.

1280
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:24,790
What?

1281
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,031
She was impressed with
our performance in the games.

1282
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,112
She invited us to join next semester!

1283
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,716
Congratulations, guys!

1284
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,151
And that's not the only piece
of good news.

1285
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,913
Sherrie and I are engaged!

1286
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,477
Who is Sherrie?

1287
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,594
She's my mom.

1288
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:43,593
Well, if it isn't my two favorite fellas!

1289
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,239
Come here. Give me some sugar.

1290
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,639
So uncomfortable.

1291
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,154
Come on, Scott.

1292
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,311
I don't want you to think of me
as your new dad.

1293
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,471
After all, we're fraternity brothers first.

1294
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,630
This is so weird.

1295
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,474
Just think of me
as your big brother

1296
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,080
that's marrying your mother.

1297
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,230
Wait. Hold on.

1298
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:03,518
We're brothers who share
the same mom slash wife.

1299
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,590
That's worse.

1300
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,239
Well, I guess we should be going now.

1301
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,271
Promise me you'll keep in touch.

1302
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:20,080
You're the scariest bunch
of monsters I have ever met.

1303
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:25,956
Don't let anyone tell you different.

1304
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:54,999
So, what now?

1305
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,120
You know, for the first time in my life,
I don't really have a plan.

1306
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:03,157
You're the great Mike Wazowski.
You'll come up with something.

1307
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:07,314
I think it's time I leave the greatness
to other monsters.

1308
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,357
I'm okay just being okay.

1309
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,675
So long, Sull.

1310
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,156
So long.

1311
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:51,476
Wazowski!

1312
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,000
Stop the bus!

1313
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,316
Are you crazy?

1314
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,440
Mike,

1315
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,876
I don't know a single Scarer
who can do what you do.

1316
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,198
I know, everyone sees us together,

1317
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,795
they think I'm the one running the show,
but the truth is,

1318
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,714
I've been riding your coattails
since day one!

1319
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,799
You made the deal with Hardscrabble.

1320
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,509
You took a hopeless team
and made them champions.

1321
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,034
All I did was catch a pig!

1322
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,709
Technically, I caught the pig.

1323
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,999
Exactly! And you think you're just okay?

1324
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,549
You pulled off the biggest Scare
this school has ever seen!

1325
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,718
- That wasn't me!
- That was you!

1326
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,911
You think l could have done that
without you?

1327
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,396
I didn't even bring a pencil
on the first day of school.

1328
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:34,394
Mike, you're not scary. Not even a little.

1329
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:35,914
But you are fearless.

1330
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,595
And if Hardscrabble can't see that,
then she can just...

1331
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,791
I can just what?

1332
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:47,911
Careful, Mr. Sullivan.
I was just warming up to you.

1333
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:49,830
Sorry.

1334
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,754
Well, gentlemen,

1335
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:56,079
it seems you made the front page again.

1336
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,120
The two of you did something together

1337
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,592
that no one has ever done before.

1338
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,154
You surprised me.

1339
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:10,236
Perhaps I should keep an eye out
for more surprises

1340
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,800
like you in my program.

1341
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,719
But as far as the two of you
are concerned

1342
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,832
there is nothing I can do for you now.

1343
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,919
Except, perhaps, wish you luck.

1344
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:29,795
And, Mr. Wazowski,
keep surprising people.

1345
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:43,670
You know, there is still one way
we can work at a Scare company.

1346
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,397
They're always hiring in the mailroom.

1347
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,558
This is better than I ever imagined!

1348
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:58,360
I bet we break the all-time record
in our first year.

1349
01:32:58,440 --> 01:32:59,874
Mike, we're mail guys.

1350
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:03,158
I know. I'm talking about
the record for letters delivered!

1351
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:07,076
All right, newbies, quit goofing around.

1352
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,755
I'll have you know tampering
with the mail is a crime

1353
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,752
- punishable by banishment!
- Yes, sir.

1354
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,433
We're right on it, Mr. Snowman.

1355
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,000
The team of Wazowski and Sullivan

1356
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:17,151
are going to change the world
starting today!

1357
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,230
Say scream!

1358
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,396
- Scream!
- Scream!

1359
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:05,280
Wazowski, good luck on your first day!

1360
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,430
Thanks, Merv.

1361
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,512
- Good luck, Mike!
- Thanks, fellas.

1362
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:16,560
You coming, Coach?

1363
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,400
You better believe it.

1364
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:02,794
I made it! My first day of class!

1365
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:07,796
The school year's over, son.
You missed it.

1366
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:10,836
Great.
