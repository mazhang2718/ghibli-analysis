161
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,833

I heard.

163

Who told you?
Did Tigress tell you?

164
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,670
I heard from Monkey,
and Crane, and Mantis,

165
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,912
and your dad,
and Mrs. Chao from the gift shop,

166

you just passed,

167

and Tigress told me.

168
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,277
Yeah, well, did she also tell you
that it'll never happen again?

169
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,429
Because I'm done.

170
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,590
Teaching or being humiliated?

171

Both! I don't know why you ever
thought I could teach that class.

Oh, I knew you couldn't.

173

What? You set me
up to fail? Why?

174
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,556
If you only do
what you can do,

175
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,393

Of course I do.

179

I'm the Dragon Warrior.

180
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,353
And what exactly does
that mean, Dragon Warrior?

181
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,795
Hmm.

182
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,156
It means, you know,
just going around

183
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,559
and punching and kicking.

184

185

Punching and kicking?

You think that is what

187
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,356
the great Master Oogway
saw for you?

188

A 500-year
prophecy fulfilled

189
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,960
so you could spend
your days kicking butt

190
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,839
and running through town

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,711
Against my better judgment.

195
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,678
More than you can see
in yourself.

196
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,553
Incredible power awaits you.

197
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,919
Power beyond anything
you can imagine.

198
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,516
Wow! What was that?

199
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,954
That was chi.

200
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,314
Wow!

201
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
What's chi?

202
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,636
The energy that flows
through all living things.

203
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,870
So you're saying
if I teach,

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,194
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that?

205

No. I'm saying

Oh.

Mastering chi requires
mastery of self.

209
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,197
Oogway sat alone in a cave

210
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,955
for 30 years
asking one question.
