1
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,020
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

2
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,232
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

3
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,954
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

4
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,372
Coming!

5
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,041
Hang on a second.

6
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,043
Hello?

7
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,211
-Barry?
-Adam?

8
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,882
-Can you believe this is happening?
-I can't. I'll pick you up.

9
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,219
Looking sharp.

10
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,976
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

11
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,478
Sorry. I'm excited.

12
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,481
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud ofyou, son.

13
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,983
A perfect report card, all B's.

14
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,318
Very proud.

15
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,487
Ma! I got a thing going here.

16
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,072
-You got lint on your fuzz.
-Ow! That's me!

17
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:57,826
-Wave to us! We'll be in row 1 18,000.
-Bye!

18
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,287
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

19
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,936
-Hey, Adam.
-Hey, Barry.

20
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,397
-Is that fuzz gel?
-A little. Special day, graduation.

21
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,857
Never thought I'd make it.

22
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,527
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

23
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,694
Those were awkward.

24
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:36,949
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

25
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,784
You did come back different.

26
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,369
Hi, Barry.

27
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,621
Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

28
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,374
-Hear about Frankie?
-Yeah.

29
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,168
-You going to the funeral?
-No, I'm not going.

30
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,337
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

31
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,923
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

32
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,551
I guess he could have
just gotten out ofthe way.

33
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,854
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

34
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,314
That's why we don't need vacations.

35
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,824
Boy, quite a bit of pomp,
under the circumstances.

36
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:25,289
-Well, Adam, today we are men.
-We are!

37
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,665
-Bee-men.
-Amen!

38
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,083
Hallelujah!

39
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,170
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

40
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,840
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

41
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,345
Welcome, New Hive City
graduating class of

42
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,514
9:15.

43
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,809
That concludes our ceremonies.

44
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:51,565
And begins your career
at Honex lndustries!

45
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,191
Will we pick our job today?

46
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,110
I heard it's just orientation.

47
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,195
Heads up! Here we go.

48
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,326
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

49
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,212
-Wonderwhat it'll be like?
-A little scary.

50
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,634
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

51
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,303
and a part ofthe Hexagon Group.

52
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,846
This is it!

53
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,600
Wow.

54
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:32,814
Wow.

55
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,984
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked yourwhole life

56
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:40,155
to get to the point where you
can work for yourwhole life.

57
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,534
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

58
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,703
Our top-secret formula

59
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,999
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

60
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,502
into this soothing sweet syrup

61
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:57,506
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

62
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,925
Honey!

63
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,680
-That girl was hot.
-She's my cousin!

64
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,848
-She is?
-Yes, we're all cousins.

65
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,727
-Right. You're right.
-At Honex, we constantly strive

66
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,939
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

67
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,609
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

68
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,044
-What do you think he makes?
-Not enough.

69
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,798
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

70
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,884
-What does that do?
-Catches that little strand of honey

71
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,138
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

72
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,934
Can anyone work on the Krelman?

73
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,896
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

74
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,734
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

75
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,235
But choose carefully

76
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:05,323
because you'll stay in the job you pick
for the rest ofyour life.

77
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,911
The same job the rest ofyour life?
I didn't know that.

78
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,705
What's the difference?

79
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,626
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

80
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,212
in 27 million years.

81
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,299
So you'll just work us to death?

82
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,800
We'll sure try.

83
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,613
Wow! That blew my mind!

84
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,450
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

85
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,035
One job forever?

86
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,828
That's an insane choice
to have to make.

87
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,248
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

88
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,293
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

89
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,921
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

90
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,673
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

91
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,596
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

92
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,556
Like what? Give me one example.

93
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,896
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

94
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,361
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

95
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,321
Wait a second. Check it out.

96
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,698
-Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
-Wow.

97
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,379
I've never seen them this close.

98
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,422
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

99
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,633
Yeah, but some don't come back.

100
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,301
-Hey, Jocks!
-Hi, Jocks!

101
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,410
You guys did great!

102
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:18,248
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

103
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,542
-I wonderwhere they were.
-I don't know.

104
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,918
Their day's not planned.

105
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,547
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

106
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,216
You can'tjust decide
to be a Pollen Jock.

107
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,926
You have to be bred for that.

108
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,344
Right.

109
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,224
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

110
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,394
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

111
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:45,192
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

112
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,278
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins, too?

113
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,030
Distant. Distant.

114
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,282
Look at these two.

115
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,243
-Couple of Hive Harrys.
-Let's have fun with them.

116
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,871
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

117
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,540
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

118
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:04,669
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

119
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,130
-Oh, my!
-I never thought I'd knock him out.

120
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,090
What were you doing during this?

121
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,051
Trying to alert the authorities.

122
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,677
I can autograph that.

123
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,472
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

124
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,932
Yeah. Gusty.

125
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:20,435
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

126
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,270
-Six miles, huh?
-Barry!

127
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,774
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

128
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,734
-Maybe I am.
-You are not!

129
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,403
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

130
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:35,200
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

131
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,496
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

132
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:52,217
-Hey, Honex!
-Dad, you surprised me.

133
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,928
You decide what you're interested in?

134
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,473
-Well, there's a lot of choices.
-But you only get one.

135
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,726
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

136
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,812
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

137
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:07,732
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

138
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,027
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

139
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,571
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

140
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,992
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

141
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,703
You were thinking ofwhat,
making balloon animals?

142
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,330
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

143
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,625
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

144
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:29,504
-Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
-I'm not trying to be funny.

145
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,341
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

146
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,219
-You're gonna be a stirrer?
-No one's listening to me!

147
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,929
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

148
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,974
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

149
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,310
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

150
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,771
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

151
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,148
Shack up with a grasshopper.

152
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,900
Get a gold tooth
and call everybody "dawg"!

153
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,402
I'm so proud.

154
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,162
-We're starting work today!
-Today's the day.

155
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,247
Come on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

156
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,832
Yeah, right.

157
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:10,837
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

158
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,465
-Is it still available?
-Hang on. Two left!

159
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,883
One ofthem's yours!

160
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,718
Congratulations! Step to the side.

161
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,096
-What'd you get?
-Picking crud out. Stellar!

162
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,222
Wow!

163
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,474
Couple of newbies?

164
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,768
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

165
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,394
Make your choice.

166
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,857
-You want to go first?
-No, you go.

167
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,901
Oh, my. What's available?

168
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,737
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

169
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,532
-Any chance of getting the Krelman?
-Sure, you're on.

170
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,536
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

171
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,038
Wax monkey's always open.

172
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,707
The Krelman opened up again.

173
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,833
What happened?

174
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,670
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

175
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,589
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

176
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:58,051
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

177
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,303
Oh, this is so hard!

178
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,598
Heating, cooling, stunt bee,
pourer, stirrer,

179
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,936
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

180
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,398
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

181
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,149
Barry!

182
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,987
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

183
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,656
What happened to you? Where are you?

184
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,033
-I'm going out.
-Out? Out where?

185
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,618
-Out there.
-Oh, no!

186
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,329
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

187
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,124
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

188
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,875
Another call coming in.

189
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:35,755
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

190
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,174
that gets their roses today.

191
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,467
Hey, guys.

192
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,679
-Look at that.
-Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

193
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,973
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

194
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,142
It's okay, Lou.
We're gonna take him up.

195
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,102
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

196
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,647
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

197
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,232
-Thank you.
-Okay.

198
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,151
You got a rain advisory today,

199
00:12:56,234 --> 00:13:00,280
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

200
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,158
So be careful.
As always, watch your brooms,

201
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,703
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

202
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,665
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

203
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:15,420
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

204
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,339
-That's awful.
-And a reminder for you rookies,

205
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:22,510
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

206
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,762
All right, launch positions!

207
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,768
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

208
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,521
Black and yellow!

209
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:34,772
Hello!

210
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,109
You ready for this, hot shot?

211
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,111
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

212
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,529
Wind, check.

213
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,615
-Antennae, check.
-Nectar pack, check.

214
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:46,201
-Wings, check.
-Stinger, check.

215
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,286
Scared out of my shorts, check.

216
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,873
Okay, ladies, let's move it out!

217
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,637
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

218
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:10,308
All of you, drain those flowers!

219
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,660
Wow! I'm out!

220
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,412
I can't believe I'm out!

221
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,999
So blue.

222
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,509
I feel so fast and free!

223
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,345
Box kite!

224
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,014
Wow!

225
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,448
Flowers!

226
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,789
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

227
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,958
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

228
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,084
Roses!

229
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,795
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

230
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,892
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

231
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,027
That is one nectar collector!

232
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,572
-Ever see pollination up close?
-No, sir.

233
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,658
I pick up some pollen here,
sprinkle it over here.

234
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,494
Maybe a dash over there,
a pinch on that one.

235
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,788
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

236
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,166
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

237
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,751
That's pollen power.

238
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:03,546
More pollen, more flowers, more nectar,
more honey for us.

239
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,756
Cool.

240
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:30,239
l'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Could be daisies. Don't we need those?

241
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,367
Copy that visual.

242
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,036
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

243
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,622
Say again?
You're reporting a moving flower?

244
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,082
Affirmative.

245
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,177
That was on the line!

246
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,846
This is the coolest. What is it?

247
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,516
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

248
00:16:56,599 --> 00:17:00,687
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

249
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,355
Yeah, fuzzy.

250
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,273
Chemical-y.

251
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,526
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.

252
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,737
My sweet lord of bees!

253
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,823
Candy-brain, get offthere!

254
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,616
Problem!

255
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,454
-Guys!
-This could be bad.

256
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,747
Affirmative.

257
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,457
Very close.

258
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,960
Gonna hurt.

259
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,129
Mama's little boy.

260
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,131
You are way out of position, rookie!

261
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,469
Coming in at you like a missile!

262
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,016
Help me!

263
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,437
I don't think these are flowers.

264
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,897
-Should we tell him?
-I think he knows.

265
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,315
What is this?

266
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,405
Match point!

267
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:57,493
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

268
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,962
Yowser!

269
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,867
Gross.

270
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,582
There's a bee in the car!

271
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,586
-Do something!
-I'm driving!

272
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,505
-Hi, bee.
-He's back here!

273
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,298
He's going to sting me!

274
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:04,477
Nobody move. Ifyou don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

275
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,188
He blinked!

276
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,397
Spray him, Granny!

277
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,982
What are you doing?

278
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,410
Wow, the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

279
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,080
I gotta get home.

280
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,759
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.

281
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,511
Can't fly in rain.

282
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,481
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

283
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,195
Ken, could you close
the window please?

284
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,907
Check out my new rÃÂÃÂ©sumÃÂÃÂ©.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

285
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,784
You see? Folds out.

286
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,287
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

287
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,791
What was that?

288
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,503
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

289
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,839
Drapes!

290
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,716
That is diabolical.

291
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,969
It's fantastic.
It's got all my special skills,

292
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,721
even my top-ten favorite movies.

293
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,639
What's your number one? Star Wars?

294
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,182
Nah, I don't go for that

295
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,436
kind of stuff.

296
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,355
No wonderwe shouldn't talk to them.
They're out oftheir minds.

297
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,649
When I leave a job interview,
they're flabbergasted,

298
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,776
can't believe what I say.

299
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,821
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

300
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,533
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

301
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,250
I predicted global warming.

302
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:55,046
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

303
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,882
Wait! Stop! Bee!

304
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,887
Stand back. These are winter boots.

305
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,766
Wait!

306
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,351
Don't kill him!

307
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,562
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

308
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:14,398
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

309
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:19,946
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

310
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,406
I'm just saying all life has value.

311
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,034
You don't know
what he's capable offeeling.

312
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,537
My brochure!

313
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,971
There you go, little guy.

314
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,602
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

315
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,146
Put that on your rÃÂÃÂ©sumÃÂÃÂ© brochure.

316
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,148
My whole face could puff up.

317
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,192
Make it one ofyour special skills.

318
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,237
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

319
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,325
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

320
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,996
-Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
-Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

321
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,206
-You could put carob chips on there.
-Bye.

322
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,583
-Supposed to be less calories.
-Bye.

323
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,050
I gotta say something.

324
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:26,303
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

325
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,390
All right, here it goes.

326
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,445
Nah.

327
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,162
What would I say?

328
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,624
I could really get in trouble.

329
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:01,047
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

330
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,965
I can't believe I'm doing this.

331
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:04,925
I've got to.

332
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,303
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!

333
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,264
No. Yes. No.

334
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,349
Do it. I can't.

335
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:17,146
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

336
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,732
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

337
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,901
Hi!

338
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,652
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,821
-You're talking.
-Yes, I know.

340
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,406
You're talking!

341
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,783
I'm so sorry.

342
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:32,119
No, it's okay. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

343
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,288
But I don't recall going to bed.

344
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,458
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

345
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:42,296
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

346
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,633
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

347
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,094
but they were all trying to kill me.

348
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,471
And if it wasn't for you...

349
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,057
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

350
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,228
That was a little weird.

351
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,355
-I'm talking with a bee.
-Yeah.

352
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:03,150
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

353
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:06,028
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

354
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:09,532
-Wait! How did you learn to do that?
-What?

355
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,951
The talking thing.

356
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:16,038
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

357
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,790
-That's very funny.
-Yeah.

358
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:22,169
Bees are funny. Ifwe didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

359
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:23,295
Anyway...

360
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:27,174
-Can I get you something?
-Like what?

361
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:31,387
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Coffee?

362
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,764
I don't want to put you out.

363
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,350
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

364
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,519
-It's just coffee.
-I hate to impose.

365
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,397
-Don't be ridiculous!
-Actually, I would love a cup.

366
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,023
Hey, you want rum cake?

367
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,525
-I shouldn't.
-Have some.

368
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,652
-No, I can't.
-Come on!

369
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,904
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

370
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,031
-Where?
-These stripes don't help.

371
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,199
You look great!

372
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:55,202
I don't know ifyou know
anything about fashion.

373
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:56,704
Are you all right?

374
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,122
No.

375
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,961
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

376
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,963
He finally gets there.

377
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,717
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

378
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,888
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

379
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,182
"Why would I marry a watermelon?"

380
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,565
Is that a bee joke?

381
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,192
That's the kind of stuffwe do.

382
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,319
Yeah, different.

383
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:31,322
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

384
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,449
About work? I don't know.

385
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:37,912
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

386
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,705
I know how you feel.

387
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,415
-You do?
-Sure.

388
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:45,878
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer
or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

389
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,756
-Really?
-My only interest is flowers.

390
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,509
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

391
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,096
Anyway, ifyou look...

392
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,933
There's my hive right there. See it?

393
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,684
You're in Sheep Meadow!

394
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:03,520
Yes! I'm right offthe Turtle Pond!

395
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:08,442
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

396
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,153
-Why do girls put rings on their toes?
-Why not?

397
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,698
-It's like putting a hat on your knee.
-Maybe I'll try that.

398
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:18,118
-You all right, ma'am?
-Oh, yeah. Fine.

399
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,579
Just having two cups of coffee!

400
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,679
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

401
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,055
Yeah, it's no trouble.

402
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,976
Sorry I couldn't finish it.
If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.

403
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,727
Are you...

404
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,606
Can I take a piece ofthis with me?

405
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,234
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

406
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,362
-Thanks!
-Yeah.

407
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,242
All right. Well, then,
I guess I'll see you around.

408
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,827
Or not.

409
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,662
Okay, Barry.

410
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,707
And thank you
so much again, for before.

411
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,750
Oh, that? That was nothing.

412
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,586
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

413
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,609
This can't possibly work.

414
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,279
He's all set to go. We may as well try it.

415
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,614
Okay, Dave, pull the chute.

416
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,870
-Sounds amazing.
-It was amazing!

417
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,789
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

418
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:48,542
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

419
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,211
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

420
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,464
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

421
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:56,300
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

422
00:27:56,383 --> 00:28:00,220
-Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
-Some of them. But some of them don't.

423
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,847
-How'd you get back?
-Poodle.

424
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,601
You did it, and I'm glad.
You saw whatever you wanted to see.

425
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,394
You had your "experience."

426
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:10,564
Now you can pick out your job
and be normal.

427
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,316
-Well...
-Well?

428
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,567
Well, I met someone.

429
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,320
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

430
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,615
-A wasp? Your parents will kill you!
-No, no, no, not a wasp.

431
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,825
-Spider?
-I'm not attracted to spiders.

432
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,828
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

433
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:27,081
I can't get by that face.

434
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,208
So who is she?

435
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,877
She's human.

436
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,423
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

437
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,425
-Her name's Vanessa.
-Oh, boy.

438
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:41,303
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

439
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,139
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

440
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,474
We're not dating.

441
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,895
You're flying outside the hive,
talking to humans that attack our homes

442
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,982
with powerwashers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

443
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,778
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

444
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,987
This is over!

445
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,614
Eat this.

446
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,033
This is not over! What was that?

447
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:05,911
-They call it a crumb.
-It was so stingin' stripey!

448
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:09,456
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls offwhat they eat!

449
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,458
-You know what a Cinnabon is?
-No.

450
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,920
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

451
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,046
Sit down!

452
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,840
-...really hot!
-Listen to me!

453
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:21,969
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

454
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,472
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

455
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:28,308
There's no yearning. Stop yearning.
Listen to me!

456
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:32,646
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

457
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,481
-Thinking bee.
-Thinking bee.

458
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:38,944
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

459
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,906
There he is. He's in the pool.

460
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,159
You know what your problem is, Barry?

461
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,827
I gotta start thinking bee?

462
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,996
How much longerwill this go on?

463
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,499
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

464
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,169
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

465
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:59,465
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

466
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,176
Would it kill you to make a little honey?

467
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,887
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

468
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,847
Martin, would you talk to him?

469
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,599
Barry, I'm talking to you!

470
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,773
Sugar

471
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,027
Ah, honey, honey

472
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,824
You are my candy, girl

473
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:29,286
And you got me wanting you

474
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,623
Honey

475
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,293
Ah, sugar, sugar

476
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,504
You coming?

477
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,422
Got everything?

478
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,341
All set!

479
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,884
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

480
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,552
Don't be too long.

481
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,891
l just can't believe the loveliness
of loving you

482
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,228
l just can't believe it's true

483
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:58,565
l just can't believe the wonder
of this feeling, too

484
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,067
l just can't believe it's true

485
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,319
Watch this!

486
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,862
Sugar

487
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,366
Ah, honey, honey

488
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,873
Vanessa!

489
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:21,129
-We're still here.
-I told you not to yell at him.

490
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,923
He doesn't respond to yelling!

491
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,259
-Then why yell at me?
-Because you don't listen!

492
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,843
I'm not listening to this.

493
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,262
Sorry, I've gotta go.

494
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,722
-Where are you going?
-I'm meeting a friend.

495
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,433
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

496
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,601
Bye.

497
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:36,979
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

498
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,319
They have a huge parade
offlowers every year in Pasadena?

499
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:49,116
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

500
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:53,620
Up on a float, surrounded by flowers,
crowds cheering.

501
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:57,124
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

502
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:01,962
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

503
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,299
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

504
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:08,135
Yeah, okay, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

505
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:11,638
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

506
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,307
You don't have that?

507
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,311
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

508
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,729
Oh, my.

509
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,814
Dumb bees!

510
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:24,067
You must want to sting all those jerks.

511
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:27,237
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

512
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,948
So you have to watch your temper.

513
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:33,327
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

514
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,331
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

515
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,042
Anger, jealousy, lust.

516
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,296
Oh, my goodness! Are you okay?

517
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,589
Yeah.

518
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,966
-What is wrong with you?
-It's a bug.

519
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,346
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

520
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,598
What was that? A Pick 'n Save circular?

521
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,017
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

522
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,979
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

523
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:03,065
You've really got that
down to a science.

524
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,151
-I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
-I'll bet.

525
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,488
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

526
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,533
How did this get here?
Cute Bee, Golden Blossom,

527
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,786
Ray Liotta Private Select?

528
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,247
-Is he that actor?
-I never heard of him.

529
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,167
-Why is this here?
-For people. We eat it.

530
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,378
You don't have
enough food ofyour own?

531
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:27,047
-Well, yes.
-How do you get it?

532
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,966
-Bees make it.
-I know who makes it!

533
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,885
And it's hard to make it!

534
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,722
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

535
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:38,016
-It's organic.
-It's our-ganic!

536
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,393
It's just honey, Barry.

537
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,061
Just what?

538
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,898
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

539
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:49,152
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

540
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,739
And it's on sale?
I'm getting to the bottom ofthis.

541
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,700
I'm getting to the bottom of all ofthis!

542
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,291
Hey, Hector.

543
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,921
-You almost done?
-Almost.

544
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,175
He is here. I sense it.

545
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,228
Well, I guess I'll go home now

546
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:27,691
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

547
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,609
You're busted, box boy!

548
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,113
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

549
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,074
I can talk. And now you'll start talking!

550
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:39,244
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

551
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,913
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

552
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,791
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

553
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,919
You're too late! It's ours now!

554
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,422
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

555
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,800
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

556
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:56,011
Where is the honey coming from?

557
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,389
Tell me where!

558
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:02,017
Honey Farms!
It comes from Honey Farms!

559
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:26,833
Crazy person!

560
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,163
What horrible thing has happened here?

561
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:08,041
These faces,
they never knew what hit them.

562
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,877
And now they're on the road to nowhere!

563
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,213
Just keep still.

564
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,632
-What? You're not dead?
-Do I look dead?

565
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,885
They will wipe anything that moves.
Where you headed?

566
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:21,930
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

567
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:26,685
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

568
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,520
I'm going to Tacoma.

569
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,689
-And you?
-He really is dead.

570
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,023
All right.

571
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,233
Uh-oh!

572
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,318
-What is that?
-Oh, no!

573
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,404
-A wiper! Triple blade!
-Triple blade?

574
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,115
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

575
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:44,452
Why does everything
have to be so doggone clean?

576
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,705
How much do you people need to see?

577
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,833
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

578
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,086
From NPR News in Washington,
l'm Carl Kasell.

579
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,755
But don't kill no more bugs!

580
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,844
-Bee!
-Moose blood guy!

581
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,146
-You hear something?
-Like what?

582
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,939
Like tiny screaming.

583
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,357
Turn off the radio.

584
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,121
Whassup, bee boy?

585
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,956
Hey, Blood.

586
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,209
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

587
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,461
Wow!

588
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:38,214
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

589
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:39,716
I mean, that honey's ours.

590
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,510
-Bees hang tight.
-We're all jammed in.

591
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:43,762
It's a close community.

592
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:47,807
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

593
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:51,394
-What ifyou get in trouble?
-You a mosquito, you in trouble.

594
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:54,898
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

595
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,943
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

596
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:02,280
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

597
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,491
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

598
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,911
You got to be kidding me!

599
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,581
Mooseblood's about
to leave the building! So long, bee!

600
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,667
-Hey, guys!
-Mooseblood!

601
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,837
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

602
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:38,483
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

603
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,068
What is this place?

604
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,445
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

605
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,030
They are pinheads!

606
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:46,741
Pinhead.

607
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:50,912
-Check out the new smoker.
-Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

608
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,580
The Thomas 3000!

609
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:53,707
Smoker?

610
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:58,211
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

611
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,133
A couple breaths ofthis
knocks them right out.

612
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,722
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

613
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,349
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

614
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,371
Oh, my!

615
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,501
What's going on? Are you okay?

616
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,587
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

617
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,257
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

618
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,010
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

619
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,764
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

620
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,557
That's a drag queen!

621
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,147
What is this?

622
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,533
Oh, no! There's hundreds ofthem!

623
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,629
Bee honey.

624
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:27,092
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

625
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,136
This is worse than anything
bears have done!

626
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,679
I intend to do something.

627
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:32,847
Oh, Barry, stop.

628
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,267
Who told you humans
are taking our honey? That's a rumor.

629
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,103
Do these look like rumors?

630
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:41,815
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

631
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,109
How did you get mixed up in this?

632
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,693
He's been talking to humans.

633
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,487
-What?
-Talking to humans?

634
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,448
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

635
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,033
Make out? Barry!

636
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,284
We do not.

637
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,537
-You wish you could.
-Whose side are you on?

638
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,830
The bees!

639
00:40:56,913 --> 00:41:01,709
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

640
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,504
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

641
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:08,341
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

642
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,885
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

643
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,013
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

644
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,640
I remember that.

645
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:19,519
What right do they have to our honey?
We live on two cups a year.

646
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,313
They put it in lip balm
for no reason whatsoever!

647
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,983
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

648
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,818
Sting them where it really hurts.

649
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,153
In the face! The eye!

650
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,445
-That would hurt.
-No.

651
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,239
Up the nose? That's a killer.

652
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:35,451
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

653
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:40,874
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

654
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,297
No more bee beards!

655
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,177
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

656
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,095
Weatherwith Storm Stinger.

657
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,680
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

658
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,765
And Jeanette Chung.

659
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,687
-Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
-And I'm Jeanette Chung.

660
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,523
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

661
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:09,277
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

662
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,113
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

663
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:17,410
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

664
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:22,749
we'll have three former queens here
in our studio, discussing their new book,

665
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,877
Classy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

666
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,087
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

667
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:31,591
Did you ever think,
"I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this"?

668
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:34,135
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

669
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:37,388
What about Bee Columbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

670
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,225
Where I'm from,
we'd never sue humans.

671
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:43,394
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

672
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,812
How old are you?

673
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:48,233
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

674
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:51,069
which will be the trial
ofthe bee century.

675
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:54,239
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world, too.

676
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,658
It's a common name. Next week...

677
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:01,621
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

678
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,248
Next week...

679
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:07,627
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard them.

680
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,756
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

681
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:16,803
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

682
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:23,017
In tennis, you attack
at the point ofweakness!

683
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,938
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81 .

684
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,817
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage ofthat?

685
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,987
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

686
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,781
-Is that that same bee?
-Yes, it is!

687
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,534
I'm helping him sue the human race.

688
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,829
-Hello.
-Hello, bee.

689
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,122
This is Ken.

690
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:47,375
Yeah, I remember you.
Timberland, size ten and a half.

691
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,836
Vibram sole, I believe.

692
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,838
Why does he talk again?

693
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,799
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

694
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,968
But it's our yogurt night!

695
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,594
Bye-bye.

696
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,140
Why is yogurt night so difficult?

697
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:06,853
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

698
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,188
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

699
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,650
-Frosting...
-How many sugars?

700
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:14,944
Just one.
I try not to use the competition.

701
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,281
So why are you helping me?

702
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,742
Bees have good qualities.

703
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,329
And it takes my mind offthe shop.

704
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:28,624
Instead offlowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

705
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,002
Those are great, ifyou're three.

706
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,628
And artificial flowers.

707
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:36,674
-Oh, those just get me psychotic!
-Yeah, me, too.

708
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:39,135
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

709
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,346
Bees must hate those fake things!

710
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,973
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

711
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:47,226
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

712
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,229
-This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
-I guess.

713
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,523
You sure you want to go through with it?

714
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,485
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able to say,

715
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:58,279
"Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

716
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:04,410
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

717
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:09,040
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

718
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:13,378
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

719
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,300
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

720
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,470
It's pretty big, isn't it?

721
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,598
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

722
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:29,811
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

723
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,648
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

724
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:48,704
-What's the matter?
-I don't know, I just got a chill.

725
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,922
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

726
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,133
You boys work on this?

727
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:06,597
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

728
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:11,102
All right. Case number 4475,
Superior Court of New York,

729
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,771
Barry Bee Benson
versus the Honey lndustry

730
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:15,773
is now in session.

731
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:20,445
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

732
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,113
A privilege.

733
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:27,535
Mr. Benson, you're representing
all the bees of the world?

734
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:41,632
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

735
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:46,804
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

736
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,143
Ladies and gentlemen ofthe jury,

737
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,313
my grandmotherwas a simple woman.

738
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:59,066
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

739
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:04,363
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

740
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:08,326
Ifwe lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

741
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,203
just think ofwhat would it mean.

742
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:13,664
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

743
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:17,043
for the elastic in my britches!

744
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,003
Talking bee!

745
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,547
How do we know this isn't some sort of

746
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:25,301
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

747
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,221
They could be using laser beams!

748
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:31,390
Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning!

749
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:35,144
For all we know,
he could be on steroids!

750
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,190
Mr. Benson?

751
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:47,073
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

752
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:51,285
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

753
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:54,372
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

754
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:57,375
We make it.
And we protect it with our lives.

755
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,835
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

756
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:03,589
who think they can take it from us
'cause we're the little guys!

757
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:06,425
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

758
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:10,888
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have,

759
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:12,807
but everything we are!

760
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:19,522
I wish he'd dress like that all the time.
So nice!

761
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,315
Call your first witness.

762
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,443
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms,

763
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:27,530
-big company you have.
-I suppose so.

764
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:31,200
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

765
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:34,287
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

766
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:37,915
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

767
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:41,919
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

768
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:43,921
-No.
-I couldn't hear you.

769
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,464
-No.
-No.

770
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:49,302
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

771
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:54,181
it seems you thought a bearwould be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

772
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,601
They're very lovable creatures.

773
00:48:56,684 --> 00:49:00,187
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

774
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:01,606
You mean like this?

775
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,194
Bears kill bees!

776
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:10,948
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?

777
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:14,076
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

778
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,955
Okay, that's enough. Take him away.

779
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:28,007
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

780
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,177
-Where have I heard it before?
-I was with a band called The Police.

781
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,971
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

782
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:36,349
-No, I haven't.
-No, you haven't.

783
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:38,893
And so here we have
yet another example

784
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,729
of bee culture casually stolen
by a human

785
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,231
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

786
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,483
Oh, please.

787
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,693
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

788
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:50,655
Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting.

789
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:55,034
Or should I say, Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

790
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,455
That's not his real name? You idiots!

791
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:04,001
Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations
on your Emmy win

792
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,962
for a guest spot on ER in 2005.

793
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:08,923
Thank you. Thank you.

794
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,718
I see from your rÃÂÃÂ©sumÃÂÃÂ©
that you're devilishly handsome

795
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:16,013
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

796
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:18,849
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

797
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,103
Not yet it isn't.
But is this what it's come to for you?

798
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,188
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees

799
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:28,693
so you don't have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

800
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:31,278
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

801
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,490
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

802
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:39,203
Why doesn't someone just step
on this creep, and we can all go home?

803
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,956
-Order in this court!
-You're all thinking it!

804
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,541
Order! Order, I say!

805
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:45,960
-Say it!
-Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

806
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:54,760
I think it was awfully nice
ofthat bear to pitch in like that.

807
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:57,138
I think the jury's on our side.

808
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,516
Are we doing everything right, legally?

809
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,767
I'm a florist.

810
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:05,396
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

811
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,814
To a great team!

812
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,443
Well, hello.

813
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,445
-Ken!
-Hello.

814
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,447
I didn't think you were coming.

815
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:19,285
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... The battery.

816
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:24,206
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

817
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,876
Oh, that was lucky.

818
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:32,089
There's a little left. I could heat it up.

819
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,467
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

820
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,348
So, I hear you're quite a tennis player.

821
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:44,935
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

822
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:50,900
That's where I usually sit. Right there.

823
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,781
Ken, Barry was looking at your rÃÂÃÂ©sumÃÂÃÂ©,
and he agreed with me

824
00:51:56,864 --> 00:52:01,118
that eating with chopsticks
isn't really a special skill.

825
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:04,205
You think I don't see what you're doing?

826
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:07,958
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

827
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,085
Do we?

828
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:14,673
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

829
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:17,468
That's just what I was thinking
about doing.

830
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:22,556
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

831
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,896
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

832
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,731
Yeah, you do that.

833
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,820
Look at that.

834
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:50,835
You know, I've just about had it
with your little mind games.

835
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,420
-What's that?
-Italian Vogue.

836
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,172
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

837
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:56,590
A lot of ads.

838
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,008
Rememberwhat Van said,

839
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,261
why is your life
more valuable than mine?

840
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:03,472
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

841
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,434
I think something stinks in here!

842
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,019
I love the smell of flowers.

843
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:12,189
How do you like the smell offlames?

844
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:13,315
Not as much.

845
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,958
Water bug! Not taking sides!

846
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:36,463
Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

847
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,257
I've got issues!

848
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:45,806
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

849
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,892
-You're bluffing.
-Am I?

850
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,154
Surf's up, dude!

851
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,488
Poo water!

852
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,577
That bowl is gnarly.

853
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,080
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

854
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:12,583
Kenneth! What are you doing?

855
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:16,086
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

856
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,172
We need to talk!

857
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,090
He's just a little bee!

858
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:25,095
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

859
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:30,225
Long time? What are you talking about?
Are there other bugs in your life?

860
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:33,646
No, but there are other things
bugging me in life.

861
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:35,439
And you're one ofthem!

862
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,651
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

863
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:42,863
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

864
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:44,698
Goodbye, Ken.

865
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:50,120
And for your information,

866
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:55,292
I prefer sugar-free,
artificial sweeteners made by man!

867
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:58,796
I'm sorry about all that.

868
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:02,549
I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!

869
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:07,513
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

870
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:10,224
I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well.

871
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,142
Are you okay for the trial?

872
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:15,688
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

873
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:19,733
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

874
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:21,151
Good idea!

875
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:24,530
You can really see why he's considered
one ofthe best lawyers...

876
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:25,280
Yeah.

877
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:30,452
Layton, you've gotta weave some magic
with this jury,

878
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,496
or it's gonna be all over.

879
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:36,917
Don't worry. The only thing I have to do
to turn this jury around

880
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:40,713
is to remind them
ofwhat they don't like about bees.

881
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:43,257
-You got the tweezers?
-Are you allergic?

882
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,176
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

883
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:51,015
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

884
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:56,311
What exactly is your relationship
to that woman?

885
00:55:57,938 --> 00:55:58,897
We're friends.

886
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,274
-Good friends?
-Yes.

887
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,527
How good? Do you live together?

888
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,070
Wait a minute...

889
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:06,780
Are you her little

890
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,866
bedbug?

891
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:12,911
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

892
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:16,790
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

893
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,918
-Yeah, but...
-So those aren't your real parents!

894
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,754
-Oh, Barry...
-Yes, they are!

895
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:23,088
Hold me back!

896
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:26,175
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

897
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:27,634
He's denouncing bees!

898
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:30,304
Don't y'all date your cousins?

899
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,140
-Objection!
-I'm going to pincushion this guy!

900
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:38,145
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

901
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,569
Oh, I'm hit!

902
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,738
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

903
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,448
Order! Order!

904
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,743
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

905
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:56,789
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

906
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:59,333
You see?
You can't treat them like equals!

907
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,335
They're striped savages!

908
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:06,006
Stinging's the only thing they know!
It's theirway!

909
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,134
-Adam, stay with me.
-I can't feel my legs.

910
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:14,223
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

911
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,100
from my heaving buttocks?

912
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,937
I will have order in my court. Order!

913
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,522
Order, please!

914
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:26,318
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

915
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,904
took a pointed turn
against the bees yesterday

916
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:32,825
when one of their legal team
stung Layton T. Montgomery.

917
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:49,508
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

918
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,343
-Is there much pain?
-Yeah.

919
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,180
I...

920
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,559
-I blew the whole case, didn't I?
-It doesn't matter.

921
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:01,478
What matters is you're alive.
You could have died.

922
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:04,314
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

923
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:09,319
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

924
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:12,239
Look, there's a little celery still on it.

925
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:14,867
What was it like to sting someone?

926
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,327
I can't explain it. It was all...

927
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,914
All adrenaline and then...
And then ecstasy!

928
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:25,210
All right.

929
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:27,337
You think it was all a trap?

930
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:30,632
Of course.
I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.

931
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,634
What were we thinking? Look at us.

932
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:35,095
We're just a couple of bugs
in this world.

933
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,514
What will the humans do to us
ifthey win?

934
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:38,849
I don't know.

935
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:42,352
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

936
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:46,023
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

937
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,441
Oh, my.

938
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:52,529
Could you get a nurse
to close that window?

939
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:54,573
-Why?
-The smoke.

940
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,283
Bees don't smoke.

941
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:59,328
Right. Bees don't smoke.

942
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:04,208
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

943
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,585
That's it! That's our case!

944
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,503
It is? It's not over?

945
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:10,547
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

946
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:13,634
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

947
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:19,723
And assuming you've done
step 29 correctly,

948
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:20,974
you're ready for the tub.

949
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,357
Mr. Flayman.

950
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,942
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

951
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,736
Where is the rest ofyour team?

952
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,155
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

953
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,908
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

954
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,702
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

955
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,580
I actually heard a funny story about...

956
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:46,291
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

957
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:49,044
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

958
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:53,840
How much longerwill we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

959
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:58,387
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

960
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:02,808
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

961
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:06,395
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

962
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,772
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

963
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,233
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

964
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,568
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

965
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:16,405
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

966
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:19,658
Show me the smoking gun!

967
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,995
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

968
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:25,414
Here is your smoking gun.

969
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,002
What is that?

970
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,545
It's a bee smoker!

971
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,631
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

972
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:38,051
This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.

973
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:46,435
Look at what has happened

974
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:50,689
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

975
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,858
Is this what nature intended for us?

976
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:55,819
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

977
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,322
in man-made wooden slat
work camps?

978
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:03,118
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

979
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:09,041
-What are we gonna do?
-He's playing the species card.

980
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:13,670
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

981
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:16,965
Free the bees! Free the bees!

982
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:18,508
Free the bees!

983
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:21,511
Free the bees! Free the bees!

984
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:25,515
The court finds in favor of the bees!

985
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,059
Vanessa, we won!

986
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:30,145
I knew you could do it! High-five!

987
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:32,230
Sorry.

988
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:35,359
I'm okay! You know what this means?

989
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:37,819
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

990
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:40,322
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

991
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:47,704
This is an unholy perversion
ofthe balance of nature, Benson.

992
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:49,456
You'll regret this.

993
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:52,709
Barry, how much honey is out there?

994
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:54,586
All right. One at a time.

995
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,380
Barry, who are you wearing?

996
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:59,174
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

997
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,386
-What if Montgomery's right?
-What do you mean?

998
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:06,598
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

999
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:12,396
Congratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

1000
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:16,191
First, we'll demand a complete
shutdown of all bee work camps.

1001
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:21,154
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

1002
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:22,864
every last drop.

1003
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:26,952
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

1004
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:29,996
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

1005
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,999
We're all aware
ofwhat they do in the woods.

1006
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,419
Wait for my signal.

1007
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:38,547
Take him out.

1008
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:43,427
He'll have nausea for a few hours,
then he'll be fine.

1009
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:47,013
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

1010
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:49,015
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

1011
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:52,436
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

1012
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:56,231
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

1013
01:02:58,233 --> 01:02:59,526
Can't breathe.

1014
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,572
Bring it in, boys!

1015
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:07,701
Hold it right there! Good.

1016
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:10,662
Tap it.

1017
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:17,461
Mr. Buzzwell,
we just passed three cups,

1018
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:19,171
and there's gallons more coming!

1019
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:23,133
-I think we need to shut down!
-Shut down? We've never shut down.

1020
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:28,430
Shut down honey production!
Stop making honey!

1021
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:34,603
Turn your key, sir!

1022
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:47,574
What do we do now?

1023
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,413
Cannonball!

1024
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:03,256
We're shutting down honey production!

1025
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,508
Mission abort.

1026
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:08,094
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

1027
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,603
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

1028
01:04:58,687 --> 01:04:59,646
Oh, yeah?

1029
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,482
What's going on? Where is everybody?

1030
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,819
-Are they out celebrating?
-They're home.

1031
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:09,155
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

1032
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:12,325
I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

1033
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:13,910
At least we got our honey back.

1034
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:18,164
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

1035
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:22,711
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

1036
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:26,798
This was my new desk.
This was my new job.

1037
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,342
I wanted to do it really well. And now...

1038
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:32,345
Now I can't.

1039
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:45,859
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

1040
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,153
I thought their lives would be better!

1041
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:51,865
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

1042
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:54,993
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

1043
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,746
-What did you want to show me?
-This.

1044
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:01,041
What happened here?

1045
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:03,418
That is not the half of it.

1046
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,676
Oh, no. Oh, my.

1047
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:14,387
They're all wilting.

1048
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,556
Doesn't look very good, does it?

1049
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,974
No.

1050
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:20,769
And whose fault do you think that is?

1051
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:24,689
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

1052
01:06:24,773 --> 01:06:28,318
-Bees?
-Specifically, me.

1053
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:32,572
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

1054
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:37,661
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

1055
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:40,580
That's ourwhole SAT test right there.

1056
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:44,209
Take away produce,
that affects the entire animal kingdom.

1057
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:46,336
And then, of course...

1058
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,171
The human species?

1059
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:53,176
So ifthere's no more pollination,

1060
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,720
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

1061
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:59,140
I know this is also partly my fault.

1062
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,397
How about a suicide pact?

1063
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,898
How do we do it?

1064
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:10,068
-I'll sting you, you step on me.
-Thatjust kills you twice.

1065
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,486
Right, right.

1066
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:16,199
Listen, Barry,
sorry, but I gotta get going.

1067
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,667
I had to open my mouth and talk.

1068
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,629
Vanessa?

1069
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,552
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

1070
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,638
To the final Tournament of Roses
parade in Pasadena.

1071
01:07:38,722 --> 01:07:42,642
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

1072
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:46,146
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

1073
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:50,692
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

1074
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,861
I know. Me neither.

1075
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:58,575
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

1076
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:03,163
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

1077
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:05,165
Roses!

1078
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:07,667
Vanessa!

1079
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,961
Roses?

1080
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,296
Barry?

1081
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:14,466
-Roses are flowers!
-Yes, they are.

1082
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:17,510
Flowers, bees, pollen!

1083
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,972
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

1084
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:25,101
Maybe not.
Could you ask him to slow down?

1085
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,895
Could you slow down?

1086
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:30,648
Barry!

1087
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:34,694
Okay, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

1088
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:36,112
Yes, it kind of is.

1089
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:39,199
I've ruined the planet. I wanted
to help you with the flower shop.

1090
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:40,867
I've made it worse.

1091
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,369
Actually, it's completely closed down.

1092
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,371
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

1093
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,373
But I have another idea,

1094
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,709
and it's greater
than my previous ideas combined.

1095
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:51,586
I don't want to hear it!

1096
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:56,508
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

1097
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:59,803
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

1098
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:03,473
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

1099
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:04,682
-Bees.
-Park.

1100
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:05,892
-Pollen!
-Flowers.

1101
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,436
-Repollination!
-Across the nation!

1102
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:12,398
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, California.

1103
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,610
They've got nothing but flowers,
floats and cotton candy.

1104
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:16,986
Security will be tight.

1105
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,822
l have an idea.

1106
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:20,657
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

1107
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,992
Official floral business. It's real.

1108
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,537
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

1109
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,121
Thank you. It was a gift.

1110
01:09:28,248 --> 01:09:30,583
Once inside, we just pick the right float.

1111
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:33,920
How aboutThe Princess and the Pea?

1112
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:37,215
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

1113
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:38,591
Yes, I got it.

1114
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,679
-Where should I sit?
-What are you?

1115
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:44,597
-I believe I'm the pea.
-The pea?

1116
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,349
It goes under the mattresses.

1117
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,185
-Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
-I'm getting the marshal.

1118
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:52,272
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

1119
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,317
Let's see what this baby'll do.

1120
01:09:57,861 --> 01:09:59,821
Hey, what are you doing?

1121
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:06,160
Then all we do is blend in with traffic,
without arousing suspicion.

1122
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:12,208
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

1123
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:13,251
Stop! Security.

1124
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:15,545
-You and your insect pack your float?
-Yes.

1125
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,131
Has it been in your possession
the entire time?

1126
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,508
Would you remove your shoes?

1127
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:22,886
-Remove your stinger.
-It's part of me.

1128
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,930
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

1129
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:36,149
Then ifwe're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

1130
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:38,943
Can you believe how lucky we are?

1131
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:41,112
We have just enough pollen
to do the job!

1132
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,780
I think this is gonna work.

1133
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:44,115
It's got to work.

1134
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:46,618
Attention, passengers,
this is Captain Scott.

1135
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,995
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

1136
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,789
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

1137
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:54,459
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water.

1138
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:55,835
They'll never make it.

1139
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,004
I gotta get up there and talk to them.

1140
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,380
Be careful.

1141
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:04,510
Can I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

1142
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:08,556
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

1143
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,520
Captain, I'm in a real situation.

1144
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,314
-What'd you say, Hal?
-Nothing.

1145
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:18,066
Bee!

1146
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:20,985
Don't freak out! My entire species...

1147
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:26,908
What are you doing?

1148
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:34,874
-Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
-Who's an attorney?

1149
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,084
Don't move.

1150
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:42,256
Oh, Barry.

1151
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:46,010
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

1152
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:50,515
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

1153
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:52,266
And please hurry!

1154
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:56,354
What happened here?

1155
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:59,732
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

1156
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:02,944
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

1157
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:05,488
-Is that another bee joke?
-No!

1158
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,198
No one's flying the plane!

1159
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:11,452
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

1160
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:14,872
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

1161
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:16,124
Where's the pilot?

1162
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:18,710
He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.

1163
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:22,005
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

1164
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,715
As a matter offact, there is.

1165
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,717
-Who's that?
-Barry Benson.

1166
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,052
From the honey trial? Oh, great.

1167
01:12:28,136 --> 01:12:30,722
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

1168
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:32,807
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

1169
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,183
I can't fly a plane.

1170
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:36,728
-Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
-Yes.

1171
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:38,521
How hard could it be?

1172
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:42,400
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

1173
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:49,490
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

1174
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:52,410
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

1175
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:55,163
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

1176
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:56,414
That's Barry!

1177
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:59,959
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

1178
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:02,253
and an incapacitated flight crew.

1179
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:03,421
Flowers?

1180
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:07,800
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

1181
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:10,136
with absolutely no flight experience.

1182
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:13,097
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

1183
01:13:13,181 --> 01:13:17,435
I'm quite familiarwith Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

1184
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:19,103
They've done enough damage.

1185
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:21,064
But isn't he your only hope?

1186
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:23,941
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

1187
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:25,943
Theirwings are too small...

1188
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:28,362
Haven't we heard this a million times?

1189
01:13:28,446 --> 01:13:32,158
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."

1190
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,951
-Get this on the air!
-Got it.

1191
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:35,828
-Stand by.
-We're going live.

1192
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:39,123
The way we work
may be a mystery to you.

1193
01:13:39,207 --> 01:13:43,086
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

1194
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,296
But let me tell you about a small job.

1195
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:48,216
Ifyou do it well,
it makes a big difference.

1196
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:51,219
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

1197
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:55,139
That's why l want to get bees
back to working together.

1198
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:56,766
That's the bee way!

1199
01:13:56,849 --> 01:14:00,144
We're not made of Jell-O.
We get behind a fellow.

1200
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:02,563
-Black and yellow!
-Hello!

1201
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,152
Left, right, down, hover.

1202
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:09,987
-Hover?
-Forget hover.

1203
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:12,615
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

1204
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,328
Barry, what happened?

1205
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:20,331
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

1206
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:23,459
-That may have been helping me.
-And now we're not!

1207
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:26,129
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

1208
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:33,845
All ofyou, let's get behind this fellow!
Move it out!

1209
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:35,930
Move out!

1210
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,857
Our only chance is if l do what I'd do,

1211
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,817
you copy me
with the wings ofthe plane!

1212
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:48,901
Don't have to yell.

1213
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,529
I'm not yelling! We're in a lot oftrouble.

1214
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:55,199
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

1215
01:14:55,283 --> 01:14:58,119
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

1216
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,089
I can't do this!

1217
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:13,718
Vanessa, pull yourselftogether.
You have to snap out of it!

1218
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:14,969
You snap out of it.

1219
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:16,137
You snap out of it.

1220
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,472
-You snap out of it!
-You snap out of it!

1221
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:21,142
-You snap out of it!
-You snap out of it!

1222
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,539
-You snap out of it!
-You snap out of it!

1223
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:45,917
-Hold it!
-Why? Come on, it's my turn.

1224
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,127
How is the plane flying?

1225
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:49,670
I don't know.

1226
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:51,505
Hello?

1227
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:54,675
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

1228
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:56,093
The Pollen Jocks!

1229
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:58,095
They do get behind a fellow.

1230
01:15:58,179 --> 01:15:59,764
-Black and yellow.
-Hello.

1231
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:03,100
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

1232
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:05,937
Where? I can't see anything. Can you?

1233
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,272
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

1234
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:10,775
Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.

1235
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:12,777
-Thinking bee.
-Thinking bee.

1236
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:16,113
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1237
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:18,950
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

1238
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:21,744
-What?
-I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

1239
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:24,121
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

1240
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:25,539
Bring the nose down.

1241
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:31,963
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1242
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:36,133
-What in the world is on the tarmac?
-Get some lights on that!

1243
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:40,054
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1244
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:42,473
-Vanessa, aim for the flower.
-Okay.

1245
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:43,975
Cut the engines.

1246
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:46,644
We're going in on bee power.
Ready, boys?

1247
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:47,895
Affirmative!

1248
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:53,234
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

1249
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:54,986
Land on that flower!

1250
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:56,654
Ready? Full reverse!

1251
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:57,905
Spin it around!

1252
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:03,244
-Not that flower! The other one!
-Which one?

1253
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,538
-That flower.
-I'm aiming at the flower!

1254
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:10,251
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

1255
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:13,170
made of millions of bees!

1256
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:16,257
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

1257
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:18,592
Rotate around it.

1258
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:22,596
-This is insane, Barry!
-This is the only way I know how to fly.

1259
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:26,684
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

1260
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:30,187
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

1261
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:32,315
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

1262
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:37,737
Aim for the center!
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

1263
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:49,957
Come on, already.

1264
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:58,215
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

1265
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:00,718
-Yes. No high-five!
-Right.

1266
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:03,721
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

1267
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:08,267
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

1268
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:10,895
-Thank you.
-But we're not done yet.

1269
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:21,238
Listen, everyone!

1270
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:23,824
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

1271
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:26,911
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

1272
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:29,080
That means this is our last chance.

1273
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:34,335
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

1274
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,963
Ifwe're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment!

1275
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:39,673
What do you say?

1276
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:44,678
Are we going to be bees, or just
Museum of Natural History keychains?

1277
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:46,305
We're bees!

1278
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:47,556
Keychain!

1279
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,435
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

1280
01:18:51,519 --> 01:18:53,437
Hold on, Barry. Here.

1281
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:55,022
You've earned this.

1282
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:03,572
Yeah!

1283
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:11,372
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit.
All I gotta do are the sleeves.

1284
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:16,794
Oh, yeah.

1285
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,629
That's our Barry.

1286
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:24,218
Here comes the sun

1287
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:27,388
Here comes the sun

1288
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:31,434
And l say, it's all right

1289
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:36,063
Little darling

1290
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:40,192
lt's been a long, cold, lonely winter

1291
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:47,074
Little darling
lt feels like years since it's been here

1292
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:50,578
Here comes the sun

1293
01:19:52,163 --> 01:19:57,251
Here comes the sun
And l say, it's all right

1294
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:06,427
Little darling

1295
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:10,514
The smiles returning to the faces

1296
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,142
Little darling

1297
01:20:13,601 --> 01:20:17,438
lt seems like years since it's been here

1298
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:21,275
Here comes the sun

1299
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:24,403
Here comes the sun

1300
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:28,199
And l say, it's all right

1301
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:30,242
Mom! The bees are back!

1302
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:43,214
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes!

1303
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:45,549
If anybody needs to make a call,
now's the time.

1304
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:48,093
I got a feeling
we'll be working late tonight!

1305
01:20:57,186 --> 01:21:02,399
Little darling
l feel the ice is slowly melting

1306
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:05,569
Here's your change.
Have a great afternoon!

1307
01:21:05,653 --> 01:21:07,321
Can I help who's next?

1308
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:12,201
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

1309
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:16,789
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

1310
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:20,918
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

1311
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,503
I had no idea.

1312
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:24,797
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

1313
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,259
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

1314
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:29,343
Sorry I'm late.

1315
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:30,553
He's a lawyer, too?

1316
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:35,432
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

1317
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,351
Have a great afternoon!

1318
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:41,605
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

1319
01:21:41,689 --> 01:21:44,066
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

1320
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,944
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Can I help who's next?

1321
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:50,114
All right, scramble, Jocks!
It's time to fly.

1322
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:52,032
Thank you, Barry!

1323
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:57,037
That bee is living my life!

1324
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:58,247
Let it go, Kenny.

1325
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,916
-When will this nightmare end?
-Let it all go.

1326
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:05,713
Here comes the sun

1327
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:07,131
Here comes the sun

1328
01:22:07,214 --> 01:22:09,466
-Beautiful day to fly.
-Sure is.

1329
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:13,178
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out ofthat office.

1330
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:17,057
lt's all right

1331
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:45,297
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

1332
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,174
-Thinking bee!
-Me?

1333
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:51,261
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Get smart and start thinking bee!

1334
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:52,304
Gee!

1335
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,848
-Flying here and buzzing there
-l'm loving the views

1336
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:59,186
Listen to me, cousin
Every buzzer must choose to be a bee

1337
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:02,522
-Or not to be
-Start thinking bee

1338
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:05,525
-Barry, you got no occupation
-You mean like pollination?

1339
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:08,195
-Hey, now, that's thinking bee!
-Start thinking bee

1340
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:10,447
Listen, fella
Ain't you been on the tour?

1341
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:13,283
-Your stripes are black and yella
-l just want to be sure

1342
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:15,786
-To be a bee
-Start thinking bee

1343
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:18,622
-Can't l wait and see?
-No, Barry, that's not to be

1344
01:30:18,705 --> 01:30:21,541
Be a busy little bee
Not a tizzy little bee

1345
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:24,628
Hold it. Let's just stop for a second.
Hold it.

1346
01:30:24,711 --> 01:30:28,298
l'm sorry. l'm sorry, everyone.
Can we stop here?

1347
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:31,802
l'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

1348
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:34,971
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

1349
01:30:35,055 --> 01:30:37,182
l had virtually no rehearsal for that.
