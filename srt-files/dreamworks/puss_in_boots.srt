1
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:45,850
<i>Through the years I have been known by many names.
Diablo Gato, The Furry Lover...</i>

2
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,650
<i>... Chupa Cabra, Frisky Two Times ...</i>

3
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,650
<i>... and then The Gingerhead man.</i>

4
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,250
<i>But to most I am Puss in Boots,</i>

5
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,950
<i>Outlaw!</i>

6
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,450
I'll never forget you, Margarita ...

7
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,850
I mean ... Rosa.
Sorry. I think maybe I should go.

8
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,650
You cannot run forever, Puss in Boots!

9
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,250
<i>What can I say? I was a bad kitty.</i>

10
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,550
<i>... just a fugitive from the law,
forever running</i>

11
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,750
<i>Searching for a way to clear my name.</i>

12
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,950
<i>And I would get that chance
on this one fateful night.</i>

13
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,250
Kitty-kitty!

14
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,750
Raoul, look what the cat dragged in.
Oh, wait! That is the cat!

15
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,450
Bottle of leche, please.

16
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,050
<i>What are you doing here,  Senor ?
Did you lose your ball of thread</i>

17
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,750
So funny!

18
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,950
One leche coming up!

19
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,050
<i>I am not looking for trouble.</i>

20
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,250
I am but a humble gato
in search of his next meal.

21
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,650
Perhaps you gentlemen
can let me find a simple score.

22
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,950
The only thing you'll find tonight
is trouble, Puss in Boots.

23
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,050
Well perhaps if one of us
were to tell the law

24
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,950
that you're in town,
we could split the reward.

25
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,650
You made the cat angry...
You do not want to make the cat angry!

26
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,450
The church if St. Michael has just put up
a golden statue of,

27
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,950
The Virgin of Guadalupe.

28
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,050
I do not steal from churches!

29
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,050
Well, the boys orphanage has been donated
silver candlesticks,

30
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,750
they would look very lovely in your home!

31
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,950
I do not steal from orphans!

32
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,950
- Uh...what about Jack and Jill?
- Shh! Are you crazy?

33
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,650
The what?

34
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,150
The murderous outlaws, Jack and Jill,
have gotten their hands on magic beans.

35
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,650
Do not joke with me about magic beans!

36
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,150
I searched half my life for them.
They do not exist.

37
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,550
No, cat...
We have seen them!

38
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,850
These are the beans of legends...

39
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,650
Grows the vine to the land of giants.
And the golden goose...

40
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,750
golden goose...

41
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,750
Yeah, it's like this could set you up for life.

42
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,250
All nine of them. Show him the golden eggs!

43
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,650
No!

44
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,450
Please uh...you have uh...shown enough.

45
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,950
Only a cat with a death wish
would steal the beans from Jack and Jill.

46
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,050
The only wish I have
is to repay an old debt.

47
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,550
and this is my chance.

48
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,450
Now ...

49
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,150
Where to I find this Jack and Jill?

50
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,350
Sorry, we have no rooms.

51
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,450
I think one just overcomed.

52
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,950
We'd like a complimentary continental breakfast.

53
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,650
And do not even think about
skimping on them baby muffins!

54
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,550
Jack and Jill Mr. and Mrs..

55
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,150
We do not have any baby muffins!

56
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:15,250
- You know, Jill, I've been thinking
- Uuhh! Get it out.

57
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,650
I um...once we're done
with this magic bean business

58
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,850
and got ourselves all them beautiful golden eggs.

59
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,450
Mmhmm. Go on.

60
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,750
Why don't we cut down on
some of the hijackin' and murderin'.

61
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,750
I mean it's fun and all, but uh...

62
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,350
... I want a baby.

63
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,550
<i>- A baby what, Jack?
- A baby of ours, Jill.</i>

64
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,750
<i>We'll raise it wild,
like a squirrel or somethin'.</i>

65
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,050
Holy frijoles ...
They do exist!

66
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,350
Ever since you fell on that hill and
broke your crown, you've been talking crazy

67
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,050
Hey, what gives?

68
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,850
No!

69
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,150
You, you ... you stop where you are!

70
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,650
Those beans are mine!

71
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,750
Me?

72
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,250
You, snap me?

73
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,350
You snap me?!

74
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,950
You looking for something?

75
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,950
No.

76
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,150
<i>No hablo Ingles.</i>

77
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,850
You are going to pay for that!

78
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,950
Chupacabra!

79
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,750
- Chupacabra!
- You are crazy, woman!

80
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,050
Those magic beans were my score.

81
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,550
<i>You just caused me a chance
of getting the golden eggs, mi amigo.</i>

82
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,250
Put up your paws up!

83
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,750
Very well ...

84
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,650
If it is to be a dance fight,

85
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,050
Then I will tuesday night dance fight you
to the death!

86
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,150
How dare you do the litter box on me!

87
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,150
Can you feel me?

88
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,050
Fear me if you dare!

89
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,550
You hit me in the head with a guitar?

90
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,850
You ... you are a woman?

91
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,550
Amateur!

92
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,550
Wow! Senorita, wait!

93
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,050
Let me buy you some leche!
I am a lover not a...fighter.

94
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,950
Hello? You are hiding from me?

95
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:05,950
I like to play the games too.
I sense in you a kindred spirit.

96
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,450
I smell something familiar.

97
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,350
something dangerous.

98
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,250
something breakfasty.

99
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,650
It's been a long time, brother.

100
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,150
Maldito Huevo!

101
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,950
Humpty Alexander Dumpty...

102
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,050
How dare you show your face to me!

103
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,550
I know you're angry,
you have every right.

104
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,650
But it is good to see you, Puss!

105
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,650
Are those new boots?

106
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,050
No! They are the same boots
I wore when you betrayed me.

107
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,850
Be...betrayed you?

108
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,550
You left me cracked in pieces on a bridge,
surrounded by soldiers.

109
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,050
They wrote a song about it.

110
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,450
And how did we get on that bridge
in the first place?!

111
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,550
Because we were brothers and
brothers are supposed to look after each other. Not...

112
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,050
Humpty

113
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,950
Remember why we're here

114
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,850
I should have known.

115
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,450
I had the magic beans in
my grasp and you sent this very...

116
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,850
attractive devil woman to interfere

117
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,450
You are a curse on my life!

118
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,350
Woh! Woh! Wait! Here me out, okay?

119
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,050
Yes, yes! I sent Kitty to bring you here,

120
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,750
But she is no ordinary thief.

121
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:42,350
She's Kitty Softpaws.
The softest touch in Spain

122
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,550
That's a lot of heel for a guy,
don't you think?

123
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,250
Look, with Kitty's skill,
your sword and my brain ,

124
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,050
we've got a fighting chance here.

125
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,250
Puss, come on!

126
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,850
You of all people know that nobody
is ever ripped off the giant's castle

127
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,850
and lived to tell the tale.

128
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,450
You want to survive,
you need a plan.

129
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,350
And I've studied this job my whole life,

130
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,850
you know that.

131
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,250
Alright, let's...let's...let's be honest,

132
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,050
without me you don't even know
where to plant the beans, Puss.

133
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,550
But Jack and Jill do, they're on their way!

134
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,950
We go up the beanstalk outlaws

135
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,950
and we come down legends.

136
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,350
So what do you say? Partner?

137
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,750
No, never again.

138
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,850
I'm sorry, okay?
How long are you going to hold a grudge?

139
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,850
It's been seven years!

140
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,350
That's like 35 cat years!

141
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,350
You need me!

142
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,050
And I...I need you, Puss.

143
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,850
You got any idea what they do
to eggs in San Ricardo prison?

144
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:03,050
I'll tell you this, my friend.
It ain't over-easy!

145
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,750
<i>Adios, Humpty Dumpty.!</i>

146
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,150
This is bad, this is bad!

147
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,550
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
I know how to speak meow.

148
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,750
Such story,

149
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,750
with your twisted lies...

150
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,050
I should crack you open for it

151
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,150
<i>Look what I found</i>

152
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,150
Someone forgot his money!

153
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,350
You are dangerous ...

154
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,550
Humpty says you like danger.

155
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,250
Just think of all trouble
we can get into ...

156
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,250
The two of us, together,

157
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,950
We can steal a lot of golden eggs.

158
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,950
- And... You owe me.
- I owe you?

159
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:30,850
- You hit me in the head with a guitar.
- I regret the guitar.

160
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:36,050
Okay, I forgive you.
So ... You're in?

161
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:42,150
Only there's one tini tiny
itty bitty problem.

162
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,650
- And what is that?
- You work ... for the egg!

163
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,550
Oh, come on, Puss!

164
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,950
What happened between you and Humpty
that was so bad?

165
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:00,450
I am afraid with me and
Humpty the scars are too deep.

166
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,250
It all started a long time ago.

167
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,450
Oh, no! No! No! No! You really don't have to
tell me your whole life story, please!

168
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,750
You may want to sit.

169
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:20,450
- It is at times quite...painful.
- Okay, here we go.

170
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,250
It was the year
in which the rain had not fallen.

171
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,250
<i>The wind was big and
the basket was small.</i>

172
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,450
<i>For days I bounced along</i>

173
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:38,150
<i>A hungry little kitten with no milk,
no mama and no litter box.</i>

174
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:42,350
<i>Until I came to rest at a home
for lost children..</i>

175
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,250
<i>Her name was Imelda .</i>

176
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,850
<i>and like a mother she took me
into her heart </i>

177
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,750
<i>and raised me as her own.</i>

178
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,050
Silensio ...

179
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,150
Silensio!

180
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,350
<i>She was an angel of kindness...</i>

181
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,450
Silensio!

182
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,050
<i>... most of the time.</i>

183
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,750
I would like to introduce a new boy joining us.

184
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,350
It's okay, pequeno. You show the face.

185
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,850
Go on ...

186
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,950
<i>- And uh...that was the moment I met...
- Humpty Alexander Dumpty.</i>

187
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,550
Hey, whiskers!
You sit in the middle Boy Blue chair.

188
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,950
Come on! Is this necessary?

189
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,050
What don't you pick up somebody
your own size?

190
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,850
Who asked you, breakfast?

191
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,750
Remember what Imelda says, Boy Blue?

192
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,150
If you going to blow your top,
you blow your horn instead, right?

193
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,750
- Let spin him!
- Please don't spin me!

194
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,450
Not again! I'm gonna yolk!

195
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,350
<i>Eventough he took my beans,
the egg stood up for me.</i>

196
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,450
<i>and I decided that I would always
have his back.</i>

197
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,850
That was very impressive! Thanks!

198
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,150
Hey eggboy!

199
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,750
<i>It was something about this strange
little egg that uh...intrigued me....</i>

200
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,450
Oh, it's you...

201
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,950
I've been collecting for months now.

202
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,450
You never know when we're get lucky,
you know what I mean?

203
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,750
Magic beans,
It's what they are.

204
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,750
Hello?

205
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,250
You going to tell all the other kids
that I believe in magic now?

206
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,150
Is that what you're gonna do?

207
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,150
No? What's your name?

208
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,250
Well you don't say much, do you?

209
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,850
Well I think I'll call you Sparky.

210
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,950
Whiskers?

211
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,850
Zoltar!

212
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,750
How about Puss?

213
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,150
<i>Humpty's mind was full of
imagination and invention.</i>

214
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,050
What is it? 15 feet down there?

215
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,750
Here we go. Give me a pu...

216
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,750
I am flying!

217
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,750
<i>He spoke of legends and adventures
beyond my wildest dreams.</i>

218
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:46,550
Oh, when I find those magic beans,
they'll grow a vine straight up into the clouds ,

219
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,850
where a terrible and a fearsome giant
hoards his greatest treasure, the golden goose

220
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,750
Oh, the golden goose.

221
00:24:53,850 --> 00:25:00,950
Just one...just one of her golden eggs
could set me for life.

222
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,650
It's my destiny, Puss.

223
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:09,150
I can't really explain it,
but I just feel like I belong up there.

224
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,250
Well, this is awkward.

225
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,350
This is kind of uh...
a solo dream here

226
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,250
I don't really need a dead weight, you know?
Hold me down

227
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,250
What are you doin'? Oh man, that's good.

228
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,850
The...the...the eye thing that you're doin',
that is really splendid.

229
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,250
Okay, let me just think for a second, alright?

230
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:41,950
Okay, uh...this is crazy
but I am considering a partnership.

231
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,850
I just need to know one thing.

232
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:50,350
- Can you commit?
- Si, I can commit.

233
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,650
Oh, you can talk!

234
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,450
Could you help me up?

235
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:04,350
First rule of bean club,
you do not talk about bean club.

236
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,550
Second rule of bean club,

237
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,550
you don't talk about bean club.

238
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,850
- You ready?
- Ready.

239
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,050
From this day forth, it shall be known.

240
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,550
Never alone, always together.

241
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,050
- Humpty and Puss...
- Brothers forever.

242
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,250
<i>And from that moment on ,</i>

243
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,650
<i>we were united on a great adventure
to find the magic beans.</i>

244
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,150
Help me up!

245
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,550
Paint me!

246
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,550
<i>Humpty was the brain...</i>

247
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,450
- Good gracious!
- I never saw him!

248
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,450
It's really hurt!

249
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,150
<i>...and I was the skill.</i>

250
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,550
Well, we got red beans, we got green beans,
coffee beans, lima beans

251
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,550
but no Magic Beans.

252
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,850
- Would you care for a jelly bean?
- Oh, thank you.

253
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,350
<i>Finding them meant everything to us.</i>

254
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,750
Oh, I Almost forgot the most important thing.

255
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,350
That's me and you, Puss...

256
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,250
me and you.

257
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,050
<i>But we never did find them.</i>

258
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,450
<i>And as the years passed,
the quest for magic beans </i>

259
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,650
<i>seemed more and more
like a dreams of a child.</i>

260
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,650
<i>As teenagers, Humpty and I
looked for trouble</i>

261
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,450
<i>and often found it.</i>

262
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,750
Third time this month, Imelda.
Next time, it's jail time.

263
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,850
But they're just kids...

264
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,650
They are thieves!

265
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:42,550
You are better than this.
I believe in you with all my heart.

266
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,650
Please do not let me down.

267
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,250
I hate this place!
I can not wait for us to get out of here!

268
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,850
Throw a rock! It'll make you feel better.

269
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,550
Oh boy! we should go.

270
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,950
<i>an instinct, I reacted</i>

271
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:21,750
- He saves the commandante's mother!
- He saves the commandante's mother!

272
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,250
You saved my mother!

273
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,350
Senor Puss,

274
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,250
He is a hero!

275
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:39,750
Today we see the courage and bravery!

276
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:46,450
<i>Little did I know that one moment
would change my whole life.</i>

277
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,350
These are for you, my boy.

278
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:54,050
Wear them as a symbol of honor and justice.

279
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,850
I will make you proud, mama.

280
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,950
You already have. My Puss in Boots.

281
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,950
<i>How strange it was to be a cat in boots,</i>

282
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,650
<i>but woh, I look good!</i>

283
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,850
<i>And as the light of my path grew brighter,</i>

284
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,750
<i>Humpty's road grew ever darker.</i>

285
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,750
Gracias, Commandante!

286
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,950
Be careful of the company you keep.

287
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,650
I know. I know. I never should have tried
something without you.

288
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,150
You're not stealing lollipops anymore, Humpty.
This is getting serious.

289
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,750
You're right!
We have to be smarter about this.

290
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,250
Here, look. We need to think bigger.

291
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,050
I've been casing the silver smith
and it's perfect.

292
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,650
You and me, in and out, fifty seconds tops!

293
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,250
Will you put that away!

294
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,450
This is our home,
these people have done nothing to us.

295
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,950
Our home?
Okay, yeah. I get it now.

296
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:02,550
You get some fancy boots
and now you're too good for me?

297
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:06,350
- That is not true.
- We weren't born here. We're orphans...

298
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,550
- and all we got is each other. You understand?
- We are better than this.

299
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,150
- But we're partners.
- We are brothers!

300
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,550
But I am not stealing anymore.

301
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,850
<i>But Humpty would not give up so easily.</i>

302
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,150
I'm in trouble, Puss!

303
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,550
It's boy blue and his gang
I owe him some money.

304
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,850
They're coming for me,
just get me over this wall!

305
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,250
We got to go!
Help me up the wall! Hurry!

306
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,450
Okay, I got everything!
We did it! Come on, let's go!

307
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,250
- How could you do this to me?
- I did you a favor!

308
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,250
- We can finally get out of here.
- This is the money of the people.

309
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,750
This is all they have!

310
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:04,250
- You disgrace those boots.
- Comandate, please! I can explain.

311
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,750
Arrest them!

312
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,750
Hurry up! Go to the bridge!

313
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,050
- You tricked me!
- I had too! You left me no choice!

314
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,850
Mama ...

315
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,550
Pequeno

316
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,450
Watch out!

317
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,150
Oh no ...

318
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,450
Puss, I can't get up.
Puss, help me I can't get up!

319
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,450
Freeze!

320
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,950
- Puss, save me!
- Save yourself!

321
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,950
<i>I lost everything I cared about that day.</i>

322
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:24,350
<i>My brother, my honor, my home...</i>

323
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:30,950
<i>All I thought about was
the disappointment in my mama's eyes.</i>

324
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,950
And I have been running ever since.

325
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,550
The egg betrayed me.

326
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,450
His lies cost me everything.

327
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,150
I'm awake!

328
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,750
You think I don't want to fix the past?

329
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,850
I can't get down.

330
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:12,050
Listen, a day...a day doesn't go by
when I don't think about what I lost.

331
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,050
I lost my best friend ...

332
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,550
my only friend.

333
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,050
And I get it now, I got greedy and
desperate and I let you down.

334
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,150
I let myself down.

335
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,150
All I'm asking for, Puss, is a second chance.

336
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:32,350
Give me that second chance
and I'll help repay you back San Ricardo.

337
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:38,250
Please, Puss. Let me show you
what our friendship mean to me.

338
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,950
- I will do it.
- Oh, that's great!

339
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,550
I will do this for my mother
and for San Ricardo.

340
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,050
Not for you.

341
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,750
We are not partners
and we're not friends.

342
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:00,950
Okay and I...I promise this time
I will not let you down.

343
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:05,850
Yes! I think we got our bean club back!

344
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:31,350
- This plan better work.
- Listen, you just need to worry about your part. .

345
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,150
Don't screw it up!

346
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,850
- What?
- Again with the mask?

347
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,250
I don't need style advice from Mr. Dusty Boots.

348
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,150
Come on, Puss! Now!

349
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,650
Our biological clocks are tickin', darlin'.

350
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,450
You gotta start lookin' at the big picture.

351
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,950
What's the problem?

352
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,950
Listen, I put a lot of work into my body.

353
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:05,250
I look good and I am not
just gonna throw it away.

354
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,450
- What?
- Look!

355
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,250
Excellent!

356
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,450
I have no time to be at home
with no diapers and veggie stocks.

357
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,550
You don't have to, Jill.
I will be the stay at home dad.

358
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,150
We have 10 hungry piggies there on the back.

359
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,150
You can practice on them.
Just pull over, feed them!

360
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,450
You've got to hurry!

361
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:40,450
- Why are you not using your claws?
- Would you please just shut up? I'm on it!

362
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,850
- Just use your claws!
- Be quiet!

363
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,850
- Your claws!
- I don't have any claws, right?

364
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,450
Was that 'em hog?
There, there, sleepy sleepy big fat piggy...

365
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,550
You babysit.

366
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,750
Soft paws.

367
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,950
Well ...

368
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,950
Hello beans of legend!

369
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,750
Let's go!

370
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,250
Look at what we have here, Jill.

371
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:35,750
- You mess with our baby!
- And you took my beans!

372
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,550
Soft paws bomb!

373
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,050
You'll gonna pay for this, cat!

374
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,850
Signal the egg!

375
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:53,850
Yes!

376
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,250
- Okay!
- Ready?

377
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,250
Set ... Go!

378
00:37:37,284 --> 00:37:39,703
Well let's find out!

379
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,850
Alright, cat! Give me them beans!

380
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:45,350
Is it true, a cat always lands on its feet?

381
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,950
No! That is just a rumor spread by dogs!

382
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,750
See I told you I won't let you down!

383
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,950
You think this is over?

384
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,450
Hey, that was close!

385
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,550
Now!

386
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,250
We just gonna make it to that bridge!

387
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,950
Hang on!

388
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,150
Humpty, There is no bridge!
- Trust me.

389
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,550
Humpty!

390
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,750
We're going to die!

391
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,650
- I hate cats.
- This is war!

392
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:15,350
Giants Castle, here we come!

393
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,850
i must hand it to the egg.
This was a team effort.

394
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,350
Humpty's team had its claws ...

395
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,850
I mean flaws...
What i meant was...

396
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,450
Not claws, he's not a cat.

397
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,650
Not to say there is anything wrong ...

398
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,050
- I don't want to talk about it!
- Got it.

399
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,250
Okay, We should be close.

400
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,250
Keep your eyes up for
any strange cloud activity.

401
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,350
I am called Kitty Softpaws

402
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:45,850
because I'll steal you blind
and you'll never even know I was there.

403
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,850
Kitty,

404
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,550
you're not as good as they say.

405
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,850
You're better!

406
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,350
I will respect your privacy.

407
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,050
All right. I'll tell you.

408
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:18,750
I was just a stray, but I had beautiful claws.

409
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,150
One day a really nice couple took me in,

410
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:28,150
gave me milk every morning, loved me.

411
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:34,650
Maybe I scratched her curtains
or play too rough with the hamster.

412
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:40,250
I don't know why they did it,
but they took my claws.

413
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,450
Cat people are crazy.

414
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,550
Stop! Stop the cart!
I think this is it!

415
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,850
Can you believe it, Puss?
After all this years...

416
00:41:12,632 --> 00:41:15,051
That is a strange cloud.

417
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,750
Here! I want you to plant them.

418
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:32,250
Okay, this is it! It's happening! Hurry!

419
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,850
This way!

420
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,750
Come on!

421
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:43,450
Right Here!

422
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,150
Now, place the beans.

423
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,250
Place beans carefully please
not on top of each other!

424
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,150
Magic is very delicate.

425
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:59,350
Ok, good! Very good.
Now, just stand back.

426
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:43,950
What's happening here?

427
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:47,350
- Maybe the magic rubbed off in your pocket.
- That's impossible!

428
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,250
Okay. Okay. Let's not panic.

429
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,550
You know I read somewhere that plants
have feelings, so ...

430
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,450
come on. Say something nice to it.

431
00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:00,950
Okay. Let me just think for a second.
Hi, little plant!

432
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,550
Uh...guys

433
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,750
Humpty!

434
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:29,650
- I do not see him. Did you see him?
- I don't see him anywhere.

435
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,250
You sound...weird.

436
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:39,550
It's the thin air!
Come on in, it feels great!

437
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,650
The cloud, it tickles my nose.

438
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:52,150
It's because the upper vest.
Who knew?

439
00:44:58,850 --> 00:44:59,950
Come on!

440
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:19,150
Gotcha!

441
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,450
Meow!

442
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,750
Hey Puss, what do you think?
Do I shave?

443
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:31,250
Let me show you something.

444
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:43,050
Somewhere down there, there are two little kids.
I don't know, maybe orphans,

445
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:47,850
and they're laying on a hill staring at the clouds
dreaming about the future.

446
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,850
That was me and you, Puss.

447
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,050
Me and you.

448
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:59,550
Boys, you might wanna take a look at this.

449
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,950
The giants castle!

450
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:12,250
- Okay, time to suit up.
- Humpty!

451
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:15,050
I'll fit right in with the golden eggs!

452
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:23,350
- Brilliant or what, huh?
- Humpty, you're not wearing underwear!

453
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,950
What? Are you embarrassed? I'm not.

454
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,350
Puss remember when everyone
was laughing at bean club?

455
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:35,250
And who is laughing now? We are!

456
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:04,150
That is our target.

457
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,650
- Hey, you don't sound like an elf anymore.
- It's because the air pressure in here is normal.

458
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,050
Let's go!

459
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,050
So here is the plan:
You two get the golden eggs

460
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:19,050
- I will fight the giant.
- There's no giant to fight.

461
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,670
- The giant's been dead for years.
- What? You didn't do the reading, did you? Oh, boy!

462
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,050
Jack and the Beanstalk.

463
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:26,050
Chapter 14,
Giant takes a big dirt nap.

464
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,350
Ah, ankle burn!

465
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,050
- What was that?
- They call it The Great Terror.

466
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:36,650
It's the monster that guards the golden goose.

467
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,350
Legend has it that if you look at it,
you'll turn to stone.

468
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:42,750
But nobody really knows,
because nobody's walked away from it alive.

469
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:44,950
Follow me and keep quite.

470
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:57,550
- Shh! Humpty!
- I can't...I can't help it!

471
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:01,250
Everything's rubbing and pinching!
I need powder!

472
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,750
How are we gonna got across?

473
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,350
Champagne!

474
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:25,950
Cheers!

475
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,350
Do not worry! I will protect you!

476
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:45,650
What you gonna do?
Hit it in the head with a guitar?

477
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,550
Please, stop bringing up the guitar.

478
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:08,650
Catch me!

479
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:12,850
Hurry!

480
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:15,350
Hide!

481
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:17,750
Don't look at it!

482
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,150
Be quiet!

483
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,550
You got to get it together!

484
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:34,950
- Come on!
- Okay.

485
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:53,450
Look at this! It's egg paradise!

486
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,650
Oh, it's so beautiful. I feel like I belong here!

487
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,050
Golden Eggs!

488
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:08,950
It'll be a lot of chicken!

489
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:13,650
I thought they were going to be like chicken size!

490
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:18,150
Can you imagine laying one of this?
Ouch!

491
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:19,850
Puss!

492
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,050
- How do you suppose to get these out of here?
- I do not know!

493
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,050
Oh my!

494
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,050
The Golden Goose!

495
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,050
Just look at her!

496
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,650
Isn't she beautiful?

497
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,350
My sweet darling!

498
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:57,250
I think she likes you!

499
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,450
Let's just take her.

500
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:05,450
Wait a minute! That's the goose of legend.
We do not know what happens if we take her.

501
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:08,050
I know what happen
if we don't take her.

502
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,650
We got nothing!

503
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:14,250
Guys! Guys! It's a gold pooper!
We're taking it!

504
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,950
Almost there!

505
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:28,950
Hang on!

506
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,650
It's coming!

507
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,350
Run!

508
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:17,250
Kitty!

509
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,050
What are you doing?

510
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,050
Hang on!

511
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:51,150
Come here you!

512
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:56,150
Gotcha!

513
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,650
She's mine now!

514
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,150
Hello!

515
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:18,550
No! Fly little gosling, fly!

516
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,850
Desn't meant to be this way!

517
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,750
- Puss?
- No.

518
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,150
I'm sorry!

519
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,850
Thanks, Ranger.

520
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,950
We should maybe cut that down.

521
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:14,050
Look at that! You finally got
that family you wanted, Jack.

522
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,950
You here that? I think it just called me daddy.

523
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:21,950
- Oh! He looks just like you, Jack.
- Thank you.

524
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,250
Well, what is it?

525
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,150
I do believe that's our cue.

526
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,450
To paying back San Ricardo!

527
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:56,350
To being rich!

528
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,150
You!

529
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:14,650
Me?

530
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,650
Yeah, yeah, baby!

531
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:20,650
One, two, cha-cha-cha!

532
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,850
Three, four, cha-cha-cha!
One, two ...

533
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:25,150
What?

534
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,765
There is one word for you, Kitty Softpaws.
Me-wow!

535
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:35,750
I know you have quite a reputation with the ladies,
Mr. Frisky Two Times.

536
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:38,850
I've also been knowns as The Fury Lover!

537
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:43,050
But that was before I met you.

538
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,950
You don't know me, Puss.
I'm not who you think I am.

539
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:48,650
I'm all about the score.

540
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:53,550
Come on! Look me in the eyes
and tell me all you care about is the gold?

541
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:57,550
- Puss ...
- Kitty ...

542
00:55:58,450 --> 00:55:59,550
Oh my God!

543
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:03,050
New partners!

544
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:05,750
Do not fall for his animal magnetism!

545
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:07,650
Stay focused!

546
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:09,950
What?

547
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:21,550
So, I have been thinking, Miss Softpaws,

548
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,050
that when we go our separate ways

549
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:27,250
we can go our separate ways together.

550
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,350
Puss, you have to go now!

551
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:35,050
You do not have to push me away anymore.
You can trust me.

552
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:35,950
But ...

553
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:41,150
Give it up for the legend of San Ricardo!
Humpty and Puss, we did it!

554
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:45,950
- I'm calling it a night, guys.
- Kitty, stay up with us

555
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:50,150
No, I feel a... hairball coming on.

556
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,150
Okay, yeah! Have fun with that!

557
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,750
We should give her some privacy.

558
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:01,150
I never thought we would get here,

559
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:07,150
after all we went through.
To pull this off together.

560
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:11,850
It is good to have my brother back.

561
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,785
Yep, it sure is. Well, we have a big day tomorrow.
Really exciting stuff.

562
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:23,050
We should get some rest.

563
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,450
Good night, Humpty!

564
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,550
Que nesta!

565
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,750
I'm still alive!

566
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:15,650
Jack and Jill!

567
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,750
Kitty!

568
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,050
Humpty?

569
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,550
I will find you!

570
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:29,950
Get out of here!

571
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,450
Be gone!

572
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:30,050
What do you...what do you want?
Gold? I have gold!

573
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:33,350
Jack, egg's tryin' to bribe us.

574
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:37,550
- Hah, with our own gold.
- Come on now. All we want is a little breakfast.

575
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:40,350
- No! No! No! Please!
- How do you like your eggs, pumpkin?

576
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,550
Humpty! No!

577
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:51,950
- Hello, Puss!
- Surprise!

578
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:55,950
What is going on?

579
00:59:56,050 --> 01:00:00,150
It's a surprise party and the surprise
is on you!

580
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:03,050
Looks like cat's out of the bag.

581
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:06,750
- You were in cahoots?
- Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

582
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:14,350
I spend a lot of time in the prison
preparing for this.

583
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:17,150
- You set me up?
- Oh, yeah! Set you up? Of course!

584
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,150
You think this was all about getting the gold

585
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:20,950
and clearing your name?

586
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:26,550
This little adventure was about one thing.

587
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:29,250
Revenge!

588
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:35,150
You never knew it, Puss. But I was always there.

589
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:58,450
You wanted to repay and old debt, Puss?

590
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,150
Well so did I.

591
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,250
Why would you do this?

592
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:05,050
You left me on that bridge! You abandoned me
when I needed you the most!

593
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:07,750
- What happened to brothers forever?
- I trusted you!

594
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:08,950
Well now you're finally gonna know
what it feels like.

595
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:12,950
You know? To trust someone
and have them stab you in the back!

596
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:14,650
Guards!

597
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:19,950
Puss in Boots, you are under arrest
for the robbery of the San Ricardo bank.

598
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:22,150
Consider this the final meeting of bean club.

599
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,350
I should scramble you with onions!

600
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:27,550
You should never have come back!

601
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:32,050
Pequeno! Wait!

602
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:37,350
- Do not fight them, please.
- Mom, listen to me! I can explain.

603
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:41,550
No! Puss, not more running!

604
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:46,350
Please stop breaking my heart
and face what you have done.

605
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:53,950
I'm sorry, Mama. I let you down.

606
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:59,250
Paws where we can see them!

607
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:02,050
Turn around... slow!

608
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:05,950
Guard!

609
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:15,850
Step into the carrier! Quietlike!

610
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:26,950
Attention, attention everyone,
If you could move a little closer!

611
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:33,050
Ladies and gentlemen, I present
legendary the golden goose of legend!

612
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:40,350
Kitty? Not you too.

613
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:47,750
Gold for everyone!

614
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:52,950
We got some fresh hot gold here,
folks!

615
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:56,850
Step right up!
Get it hot!

616
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:14,250
One hat. One belt. And two boots...

617
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:17,150
... Once a symbol of honor.

618
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:21,350
One bottle of catnap...

619
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:24,250
Uh...it is for my glaucoma.

620
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:31,250
This is where you belong, outlaw!

621
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:36,050
And this is where you will stay forever.

622
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:56,750
Don't stop on my account.

623
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:12,950
It looks like the egg got what he wanted.

624
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:16,250
- You talking about Humpty?
- Ublee..ublee...umm! Don't say his name!

625
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:19,850
I used to share this cell
with that smelly thing.

626
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:23,150
Happiest day of my life was when he left.

627
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:26,050
till I realized he stole my magic beans.

628
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:29,350
Wait! Wait! Wait! You had the beans?
Who are you?

629
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,850
Hey! What's your name?

630
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:36,550
Uuh! Andy Beanstalk,
my parents call me Jack.

631
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:40,650
I traded the family cow for them beans.

632
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:44,150
Of course it wasn't my family's cow,
some others family's family cow.

633
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,850
That's why I got eight to ten year.

634
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:49,750
Always know which cow's you're...

635
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:55,250
Crazy man! Wake up!
What else do you know?

636
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:59,150
We're all goners! Thanks to that little stinky.

637
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:04,350
I told him! I told him not to take the goose,
but all he wanted was his revenge.

638
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:06,550
Don't take the goose. Why?

639
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:14,650
The Great Terror! That's the golden goose's mom.

640
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:15,850
Oh, no.

641
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:22,050
And she will be out for blood
when she comes back for her baby!

642
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:25,750
Guard! San Ricardo is
in terrible danger!

643
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,550
- You must listen to me!
- Quiet you!

644
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:54,150
Shut up!

645
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:14,350
Open the door ...

646
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:22,950
Drop the weapon!

647
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:26,050
Very good!

648
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:28,250
Step aside!

649
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:32,050
No! Diablo gato!

650
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:35,050
Nice try!

651
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:49,550
I hope you can forgive me.

652
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:52,050
Apology accepted!

653
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:54,850
I don't really have time for you.

654
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:57,650
I have to save the town from The Great Terror.

655
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:01,650
Wait, Puss!
Don't you see, I'm here because...

656
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:05,050
I am here because you made me realize

657
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:09,350
that there is something I can care about more than gold.

658
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:14,450
- Some thing?
- Okay, someone.

659
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:17,550
He's about two feet tall, wears high heels.

660
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:21,150
- Handsome?
- He's very handsome!

661
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:23,150
A real beefcake?

662
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,349
- A stallion? Yes.
- Tiger? Oh, brother ...

663
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:30,250
But, this does not make us even.

664
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:31,650
Freeze!

665
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:35,350
- Yes it does!
- No, it doesn't!

666
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:43,350
I saved you!
You owed me one.

667
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:46,050
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

668
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:50,050
So now you owe me two.

669
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:57,350
- Oh, you are a lot of work.
- I know, but I am worth it!

670
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:04,050
You are not getting away, Puss in boots!

671
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:06,350
Oh boots!

672
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:10,150
- Kitty!
- Now we're even!

673
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,950
This is your San Ricardo weather report.

674
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:23,650
The chances of giant goose
destroying the town ...

675
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:25,850
100%
... 100%.

676
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:33,150
<i>never alone. Always together.</i>

677
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:37,050
<i>- Humpty and Puss ...
- Brother forever</i>

678
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:43,550
Come on, sweetie. Let's get out of here
come before Momma shows up.

679
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:47,750
I shall make you into an egg salad sandwich!

680
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:50,150
Aah! That is disgusting!

681
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:53,950
- Give me the goose, Humpty!
- No can do, I'm afraid.

682
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:55,950
See the mama's on her way and when she gets here,

683
01:08:56,150 --> 01:09:00,250
it's bye bye San Ricardo and everything
you ever cared about.

684
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:03,650
Revenge on me is one thing;
but why Imelda?

685
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:06,450
Why the orphanage?
This is our home!

686
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:08,250
You mean your home!

687
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,550
I...I never belonged here.

688
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,150
We had a plan to get out of here,

689
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:17,850
but then you became a hero
and you picked this place over me.

690
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:21,950
You left me with nothing!

691
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:29,950
Humpty, I'm sorry I hurt you.

692
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:35,950
But do not take it out on these people.
You are better than this.

693
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:38,650
No, I'm not.

694
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:41,050
Oh, come on! I know the real Humpty.

695
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:45,650
The way you saw the world,
the inventor, the dreamer.

696
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,350
What happened to that guy?

697
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:55,750
I think it's too late!

698
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:58,150
It is never too late to do the right thing.

699
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:00,450
Together, we can save San Ricardo.

700
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:10,750
I can forgive you, Humpty, if you help me now.
I'll try!

701
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:14,786
- Really? After everything put you through?
- Prove to me there is still a good egg in you!

702
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:02,050
Run!

703
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:14,750
Googles ... check.

704
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:17,450
Get the baby over the bridge.
I'll get the mother to follow.

705
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:20,250
Give me a puuuu!

706
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:45,550
Mother Goose!

707
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:54,950
Wait! Just follow me and
I'll lead you to your baby!

708
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:02,250
No! Not that way!

709
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:06,550
Pequeno! Help!

710
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:08,050
Hang on!

711
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,050
I got you!

712
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:19,050
That's my boy!

713
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:27,750
Come with me, mamam goose!
I know where your baby is! Here!

714
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:44,850
- Humpty, Pick up the pace!
- I'm trying, Puss! I'm trying!

715
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:53,250
Sorry, Egghead.
We want more than just egg.

716
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:55,150
So how about give us that goose?

717
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,550
Humpty!

718
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:04,050
- Nice moves!
- What would you do without me?

719
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:10,550
Freeze!

720
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:16,850
Commandante! I can explain!

721
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:22,550
Gato, you are going back to jail,
if it's the last thing I do!

722
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:24,250
Humpty, hurry!

723
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:27,050
We're almost there!

724
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:53,750
- Puss! Help!
- Humpty! Hang on!

725
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:08,050
Here we are again. Right, Puss?

726
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:13,850
I will not leave you behind this time, Humpty.

727
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:24,050
I'm sorry, Puss.

728
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:28,850
I've made a mess out of everything.
I am a rotten egg!

729
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:36,550
I'm not...I'm not a person. I'm not a bird,
I'm not even a food.

730
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:39,750
I don't know what I am!

731
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:44,750
You are what you have always been, my brother!

732
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,850
Brothers forever!

733
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:06,350
- You can't save us both!
- Yes, I can. Just hang on!

734
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:12,950
Puss, you have to save the baby,
or the mama will destroy San Ricardo.

735
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:17,150
It's the right thing to do.

736
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:22,750
I will not let you go, Humpty!

737
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:27,550
I know you won't, so I won't make you choose.

738
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:30,850
Humpty!

739
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:55,450
I'm very sorry. She's okay!

740
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,650
Humpty,

741
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:27,250
I always knew that you were good inside.

742
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:43,750
Goodbye, Humpty.

743
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:59,150
It's him, Puss in boots!

744
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:03,150
- He saved us from the giant goose!
- His sword is like lightning!

745
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:05,150
They said he has ten lives!

746
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:08,950
His boots are made
of the finest leather!

747
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:11,450
He drinks whole milk.

748
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:16,450
Good legend!

749
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:20,050
He is no outlaw. He saved us!

750
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:22,850
Meow!

751
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:26,750
A gift for you, Mama.

752
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:32,650
I have to go,
the soldiers are coming for me.

753
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:38,150
I am so proud of you, my son.

754
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:45,050
Today you faced the past with bravery and honor.

755
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:48,039
You earned those boots and the people know
that you are San Ricardo's greatest hero.

756
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:57,050
I did it for you, Mom.

757
01:17:57,450 --> 01:18:03,650
- You will always be in my heart!
- And you in mine.

758
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,950
Gato!

759
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:09,850
Here he is! I see him!

760
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:57,450
- I will see you again, Kitty Softpaws!
- Sooner than you think.

761
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:08,250
She is a bad kitty!

762
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:17,050
<i>This is the story of a cat who became a hero,</i>

763
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:21,750
<i>An outlaw dedicated to justice
and a lover of beautiful women.</i>

764
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:28,250
<i>A great, great lover...
Really, it is crazy</i>

765
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:31,550
<i>I am Puss in Boots</i>

766
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:36,350
<i>And my name would become legend.</i>
