1
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:36,637
Oh, no!

2
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:38,639
Come on!

3
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,825
Come on, baby.

4
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:00,094
Grab it!

5
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,339
All right.

6
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:17,746
What…?

7
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:22,617
Ow!

8
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,127
Hmm. Vincent.

9
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,497
No, no, bad idea.
Bad idea!

10
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,342
Hmm?

11
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:30,151
Aah!

12
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:58,979
Just take what you need.

13
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,349
Just take what you need.

14
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:09,090
Mm-hmm.

15
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:29,743
What's…?

16
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,215
Mmm.

17
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,131
Whuh?

18
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:57,337
- RJ?
- Uh, no?

19
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,639
The moon's not full.

20
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,845
You woke me up a week early?

21
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:06,780
Oh, no.

22
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:12,019
Don't tell me you're dumb enough to
actually try and steal my stuff.

23
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,588
RJ, I'm gonna have to kill you.

24
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,225
Please, I'm just a desperate
guy trying to feed his family.

25
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:20,961
- You don't have a family.
- I meant a family of one.

26
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:24,832
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Look, it's still in the cave.

27
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,734
So, technically, not stolen.

28
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,403
Oh, no!

29
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,373
No!

30
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,645
Slow!

31
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:41,781
Stop!

32
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,750
Whew!

33
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:47,287
That was close.

34
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:56,063
Vincent, wait!
I can get it all back!

35
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:59,132
That's right! If you eat
me, you'd have to do it.

36
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,835
But I can get it.
All of it!

37
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:05,005
- My red wagon?
- Redder! Ow.

38
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:07,908
- The blue cooler?
- Blue cooler. On my list!

39
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:09,376
- Gotta be blue?
- Yes!

40
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:12,279
And I want my Spuddies.
I love those things.

41
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,183
'Cause with a Spuddie,
enough just isn't enough.

42
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:19,152
So true. Painfully true.
And I'll tell you what.

43
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:22,089
I'm gonna get you the giant
picnic pack, family-fun size.

44
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,993
- They have that?
- I'm pretty sure.

45
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:29,129
All right, RJ.
I'm going back to sleep.

46
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,099
When that moon is full,
I'm waking up.

47
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,569
And all my stuff had better
be right back where it was.

48
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,140
But that's just one week! That's
impossible for one guy!

49
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:42,309
A week's perfect.
I'll get some helpers.

50
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,779
Full moon, all my stuff. And don't
even think about running away.

51
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,920
Because if you do, I will
hunt you down and kill you.

52
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,725
OK! OK, buddy! You just rest easy,
all right, 'cause I'm on it.

53
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:03,730
Hey, in a week from now, we're gonna
be laughing about this thing. Huh?

Oh, boy,
that's cold! That's cold!

72
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,397
The one place
I didn't have a shell.

73
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,444
Wow.

74
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,218
Spring.

75
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,587
That means there's only
274 days left till winter.

76
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:10,823
Everybody, wake up!
Hibernation's over.

77
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,159
Oh, morning!

78
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,627
- Morning, Hammy.
- I gotta go wee-wee!

79
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,996
Oh, not in the lake
we drink from!

80
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,699
Let's go, all right, the rest of you.
It's spring!

81
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,901
That means we gotta get to work.

82
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,971
Finished. No, wait!

83
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:28,041
Come on, everybody. Wake up.
Don't make me come in there.

84
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,442
Ya'll better listen.

85
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,444
I've been holding
something in all winter,

86
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,446
and I'm about to let it out.

87
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:36,783
- I'm up, I'm up!
- She means it. Let's go!

88
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,285
Thank you, Stella.

89
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:41,354
Oh, I can clear a room, Verne.
Come on, that much I can do.

90
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,656
- Good morning.
- Good morning, everyone!

91
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,959
- How'd you guys sleep?
- Just a super-duper morning.

92
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,461
Oh, jeepers.

93
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:51,698
Whoa, not lookin' so good
around the eyes there, hon.

94
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,234
Bucky and Quillo were up
every three or four weeks.

95
00:08:54,235 --> 00:08:55,902
And Spike kept poking me.

96
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,737
Yeah. Well, he's kinda pokey.

97
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,706
He's the sharpest
of the bunch there.

98
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,242
You know what? How 'bout
I take the day shift?

99
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:04,077
Oh, Lou, that'd be just super.

100
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:10,049
All right, kids, you heard your mother,
and now you listen to me. Shape up.

101
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,251
Oh, boy.

102
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:13,353
This is what I was afraid of.

103
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:16,756
Where's the food? Is there any left?
I'm hungry, so is there any left?

104
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:21,261
We ate all the food, Hammy. During the
winter? We gotta go get some more now.

105
00:09:21,262 --> 00:09:23,563
Oh, right! I buried
some nuts in the woods.

106
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,633
I know where they are.
I'll be right back. Bye!

107
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:33,473
- That's enough.
- Dad, it was just snow.

108
00:09:33,474 --> 00:09:35,708
But it could have been
a predator.

109
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,178
Isn't playing dead
a little… weak?

110
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:40,680
Heather, how many times
must I say it?

111
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,350
Playing possum is what we do.

112
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:45,752
We die so that we live!

113
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:47,887
I'm the boss of you, OK?
So calm down.

114
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:51,558
That's what we need to find you this
year, don't you know? A good fella.

115
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:55,395
- A good fella? A good fella?
- Uh-oh. Jeepers, here we go.

116
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:57,364
Why does everyone think
I need a man, huh?

117
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:59,799
I look like a nest
and smell like a swamp.

118
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,034
So when you find
a fella who's decent,

119
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:05,673
good with kids and has no
sense of smell, call me.

120
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:16,483
- Um, hello?
- I don't care who started it.

121
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:17,950
Uh…

122
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,652
Oh, look, food.

123
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:23,190
Well, I think you know
what this means.

124
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:25,558
- Verne.
- Just a minute, Hammy.

125
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,529
This means we were nine
berries away from starvation.

126
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,798
Sorry.
That was a little intense.

127
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,667
I meant really serious
hunger pains.

128
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,169
Verne!

129
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,506
Not finished, Hammy.
Morning, Lou, Penny.

130
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:41,241
- Thanks.
- Hey, kids.

131
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,909
- What I want to tell you is…
- Verne!

132
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,579
I'm not done, Hammy. If you
have to go again, just go.

133
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,282
OK. So all I'm saying
is we cut it a little close.

134
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:52,185
So this year we need to make
sure that we fill the log…

135
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:55,722
- All the way to the top.
- Exactly. All the way to the top.

136
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:58,157
- Because what are we?
- Foragers!

137
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,127
- And what do we forage?
- Food!

138
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,896
- Right.
- Super, Verne, really super.

139
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,632
- OK, Hammy.
- Huh?

140
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:07,200
- What is it?
- What is what?

141
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,835
What is it you want to tell me?

142
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,203
Hmm? Oh. Oh!

143
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,839
What was it, what was it,
what was it, what was it?

144
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,041
Wait. Right on the tip
of my tongue. Oh, yeah!

145
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,410
There's a weird thing
I've never seen before.

146
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,747
It's really scary.
Follow me.

147
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:25,184
OK. Meeting called on account
of weird scary thing.

148
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,354
Let's go.

149
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:29,957
Hmm. Foragers…

150
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,826
Hammy, what weird thing?

151
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:37,798
Oh. That weird thing.

152
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,561
It never ends!

153
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,298
Whoa!

154
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:14,166
Hey!

155
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,569
It never ends that way too!

156
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,405
- Jeepers, Lou.
- Whoa.

157
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:20,340
Yeah, jeepers
is the word there, hon.

158
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:23,844
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Man, that's big.

159
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,382
- What is this thing?
- Heather, no!

160
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,684
- I'm scared.
- Me too, Mama.

161
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:35,755
Shh! It's OK, it's just a…
What is this thing, Lou?

162
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,292
I… Well, it's a…
It's… Verne?

163
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:41,594
Well, it's, uh…
it's obviously…

164
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,229
…some kind of bush?

165
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,232
I'd be less afraid of it if I
just knew what it was called.

166
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,401
- Let's call it Steve!
- Steve?

167
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:50,403
- It's a pretty name.
- Steve sounds nice.

168
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:52,204
I'm a lot less scared of Steve.

169
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,007
Oh, great and powerful Steve!

170
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:58,545
- What do you want?
- I don't think it can speak.

171
00:12:58,546 --> 00:13:00,146
I heard that, young man!

172
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,516
- You get over here right now!
- OK.

173
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,051
Hammy, get back here.

174
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:07,854
- Steve is angry!
- It came from the other side of Steve.

175
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:11,023
I mean the bush.
I mean… Jeez!

176
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,962
There's only one way we're gonna
find out what this thing is,

177
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:19,032
and what this is all about.
I'm gonna go check it out.

178
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,935
Aah!

179
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,905
Ay yai yai.

180
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,775
Uh… Aah!

181
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:30,643
Steve ate Verne!

182
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,713
All right, Steve,
you brought this on yourself.

183
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:39,151
Stella, don't! I'm not
eaten, I just tripped.

184
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,457
I'm gonna go over there.
Just don't anybody move.

185
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,302
Kids, come on,
hurry up! You'll be late!

186
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:03,242
Gary, come on, breakfast!

187
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,652
What is this place?

188
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,497
Oh, hey there, little…

189
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:25,932
Ohh!

190
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:28,868
…fella. Ugh!

191
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,572
Oh!

192
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:35,307
Hi.

193
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,176
Aah!

194
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:40,179
Oh!

195
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,288
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

196
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,091
Ow.

197
00:14:57,164 --> 00:15:00,000
Whoa! Ohh!

198
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:10,477
Operator. Can I help you?

199
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:13,146
No, I can talk.
I'm just driving.

200
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:29,529
Aaah!

201
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,397
Verne's back.

202
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:32,599
- Verne!
- Jeepers!

203
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,534
- You OK?
- Help him up.

204
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:37,403
- What was over there?
- Freaky pink primates!

205
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,339
They must have come while we
were hibernating. It was awful.

206
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,576
They had wheels on their feet
and these sticks, and they were

207
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:47,079
whacking me with these sticks like
it was some sort of sick game.

208
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,850
You should have died! You
should have laid down and died.

209
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:53,085
- Dad.
- That's not the worst part.

210
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,722
Half the forest is gone.

211
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:58,124
The oak trees
and the berry bushes,

212
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,227
they're just…
they're just gone.

213
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,595
Jeepers.

214
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:04,196
What'll we do for food?

215
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,934
How are we gonna live?

216
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,336
I don't know.
But here's what I do know.

217
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:14,340
We will be fine as long as no
one goes over Steve again.

218
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:19,111
It's called a hedge, and it is not
to be feared, my amphibious friend.

219
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:22,448
It is the gateway
to the good life.

220
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,551
Uh, I'm a reptile, actually.

221
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:26,686
But, you know,
it's a common mistake.

222
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,454
And, uh, you are?

223
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:31,858
Oh. Where are my manners.
I'm RJ.

224
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:34,961
Don't think I'm prying, but I
couldn't help overhearing,

225
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:39,699
and I can shed a little light on what
this whole hedge situation is about.

226
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,601
You see, what was
once mere wilderness

227
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:46,305
is now 54 acres of man-made,
manicured, air-conditioned paradise.

228
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:49,475
Except for that little-bitty speck.
You are here.

229
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:53,045
No, no, that's a good thing.
You're hibernators, right?

230
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,648
You gather up food,
store it for the winter?

231
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,784
- Uh-huh. We fill the log!
- Hammy.

232
00:16:57,785 --> 00:17:00,787
Really? This log?
This cave-like log?

233
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:03,723
- All the way to the top.
- Ozzie.

234
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:05,592
Let me ask ya,
how long's it take?

235
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:09,128
- You know, to fill the log?
- Two hundred and seventy-four days.

236
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:12,865
- Ohh! Ever done it in a week?
- That's impossible.

237
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,601
Not if we work together.

238
00:17:14,602 --> 00:17:17,403
You've got the food gathering
skills, I've got the know-how,

239
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,505
- and they have the food!
- How much food?

240
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:23,142
Loads of food. Heaps of food.
Food out the wazoo!

241
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:26,012
Well, whatever kind of food
comes out of a wazoo,

242
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:28,047
I don't think
we're interested in eating.

243
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,349
I don't know, the guy's
making a lot of sense to me.

244
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,753
- I think we should listen.
- Yeah, I'm OK with wazoo food there.

245
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:37,023
No, you're not.
The tail is tingling.

246
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:40,292
- Why didn't you say so?
- Hold on, hold on. The what is what?

247
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:43,395
When something doesn't feel right,
my tail tingles. Let me tell you,

248
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,398
everything you've said so far
is driving my tail crazy.

249
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,637
Listen. Verne, right? This isn't
something you need to be afraid of.

250
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:53,873
Well, I am.
And for good reason.

251
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:55,474
This is not a birthmark.

252
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,310
That's because you went
over there without a guide.

253
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,747
Thanks for stopping by.
We're not interested.

254
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:04,550
Not interested in the most
delicious food you've ever tasted?

255
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:05,752
- No!
- Come on.

256
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:08,788
Not interested!

257
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:11,490
OK. I get it.

258
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:17,764
I understand. This is something
that you're just not open to.

259
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:20,367
Wow!

260
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,372
Whoa!

261
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:28,240
- Oh, my!
- Jeepers.

262
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,209
What is that?

263
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,112
That, my friend, is a magical
combination of corn flour,

264
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:38,084
dehydrated cheese solids,
BHA, BHT and good old MSG,

265
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:42,288
a.k.a., the chip.
Nacho cheese flavor.

266
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:45,357
- Over here! Toss me one of those!
- More please! More.

267
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,359
Yeah, Verne, those were good!

268
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,362
It's all good. And we're
going over there. Tonight!

269
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,365
Yeah!

270
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,868
Welcome to suburbia.

271
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:59,171
- Wow!
- Look at that!

272
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:03,575
Hey, Mom, look at us!
Look at us!

273
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:06,578
Oh, my!
Hon, look at this.

274
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,314
Jeepers.

275
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,415
How's that tail, Verne?

276
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,951
Listen, if anybody
in this family gets hurt,

277
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:13,920
I'm holding you responsible.

278
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:18,057
They're having a good time. I'll
take responsibility for that.

279
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:19,826
- This is neat.
- Look at that.

280
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,627
- Hey, Spike, look at that.
- Hey, Verno,

281
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:24,997
I took a few clippings out of my
quills to do a little comparison.

282
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,300
Look at this, the grass seems
to be greener over here.

283
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:31,137
Verne, are you certain
you came to the same place?

284
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:33,005
Yeah, 'cause the raccoon says…

285
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,974
OK, enough about him.
I get it.

286
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:39,178
So he can do a couple of tricks. I mean,
it's not like he can walk on water.

287
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,315
Hey, everybody!
This way to the food!

288
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:46,085
- That thing's huge!
- What is that?

289
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:49,188
That is an SUV.
Humans ride around in it

290
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,091
because they are slowly
losing their ability to walk.

291
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:55,661
- Jeepers, it's so big!
- How many humans fit in there?

292
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:58,230
Usually? One.

293
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:02,034
Hi, this is Gladys Sharp.
Your president?

294
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,003
Of the homeowner's
association? Right.

295
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,537
- Jeepers.
- What is that?

296
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,141
Easy, easy, don't worry.
That's just a human being.

297
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,911
And they are just as scared
of us as we are of them.

298
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:15,181
Now, if a human does happen
to see you, just lay down,

299
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:18,818
roll over and give your privates
a good licking. They love it.

300
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:22,721
The charter, which you signed, says the
grass is supposed to be two inches,

301
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,292
and according to my measuring
stick, yours is 2.5.

302
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:30,496
Could we just get the food and go?
Really, do they have it or not?

303
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:34,733
Didn't you see it? It was in the box.
They've always got food with them.

304
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,737
We eat to live,
these guys live to eat.

305
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,739
Let me show you
what I'm talking about.

306
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,275
The human mouth
is called a "pie hole."

307
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:46,012
The human being
is called a "couch potato."

308
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:48,714
That is a device to summon food.

309
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:51,717
That is one of the many
voices of food.

310
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:54,486
That is the portal for
the passing of the food.

311
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:58,090
That is one of the many food
transportation vehicles.

312
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,359
Humans bring the food,
take the food,

313
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,795
ship the food,
they drive the food,

314
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:07,133
they wear the food! That gets the food hot.
That keeps the food cold.

315
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:09,869
That…
I'm not sure what that is.

316
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,503
Aah!

317
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:13,906
What do you know? Food!

318
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:17,476
That is the altar
where they worship food.

319
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:20,012
That's what they eat
when they eat too much.

320
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:22,681
That gets rid of guilt
so they can eat more food.

321
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:25,551
Food! Food! Food! Food!

322
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:27,186
Food!

323
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:30,422
So you think they have enough?

324
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:34,426
Well, they don't. For humans,
enough is never enough!

325
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:38,297
And what do they do with
the stuff they don't eat?

326
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:42,801
They put it in gleaming,
silver cans,

327
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,171
just for us.

328
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,774
Sweet jeepers.

329
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:51,078
Dig in!

330
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:55,181
- Good, isn't it?
- OK.

331
00:21:55,182 --> 00:22:00,452
- Wow.
- Share there, everyone, share.

332
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:05,691
That's a diaper. And that
does come out of a wazoo.

333
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:09,161
So, what do you think?
Was I right or was I right?

334
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,297
And these things
are just the scraps!

335
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:14,500
Wait'll you see what comes in
the boxes, packages and cans!

336
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:17,136
I'm telling you, stick
with me, and in one week

337
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:19,838
we will gather enough food to…

338
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,174
- To feed a bear.
- What?

339
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:25,078
Just a figure of speech.

340
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:30,816
Halt! Intruders! Intruders!
Get out, all of you.

341
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:33,719
What is it, baby?

342
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,923
- What are you doing?
- You said to lick our…

343
00:22:36,924 --> 00:22:39,691
No! Nix that! Run!

344
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,193
- Run!
- Get outta here!

345
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,795
Run!

346
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,364
- Shoo!
- To the hedge!

347
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,367
Get out of here!
I just mopped this patio!

348
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,337
Filthy vermin!

349
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,208
Verne's right,
that was horrible.

350
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,110
- You kids OK?
- Stay close.

351
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:02,114
- We'll find other food, right?
- See? That's what I was talking about!

352
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:04,116
These humans
don't want us around.

353
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:07,353
So we scared her, and she overreacted.
No biggie.

354
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:10,556
No biggie? Oh, that is
what we call a biggie.

355
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:13,926
Come on, think about the food. It
was worth it for that food, huh?

356
00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:15,661
That stuff is to die for!

357
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:19,098
Let me rephrase that.

358
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:21,833
No, to die for.
You nailed that part.

359
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:26,172
Look, maybe our little forest life
looks primitive to a guy with a bag.

360
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:28,040
- What?
- But I think I speak

361
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,242
for the whole family
when I say we want nothing

362
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:34,146
to do with anything
that's over that hedge.

363
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:36,382
- Oh, come on!
- I'm done.

364
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:40,119
You haven't even tried doughnuts yet!
You wanna store fat?

365
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,988
That is the way
to store some fat.

366
00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:44,256
You'll be sweatin'
through the winter!

367
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:48,660
- We'll eat the bark, right?
- OK, all right, you guys sleep on it!

368
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:52,299
Good idea. I'm gonna
check back with you.

369
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:55,667
Shoot!

370
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,971
Almost had 'em.

371
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,978
- Good night, Heather.
- Good night.

372
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:07,546
- Good night, Ozzie.
- Good night.

373
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:09,081
- Good night, Lou.
- Good night.

374
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:10,482
- Night, Penny.
- Good night.

375
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,184
- Good night, Hammy.
- Good night.

376
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:13,752
- Night, Bucky.
- Good night.

377
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,854
- Good night, Spike.
- Good night, Uncle Verne.

378
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:18,190
- Good night, Quillo.
- Night, Uncle Verne.

379
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:20,492
When we wake up, only 273
days left till winter.

380
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:24,564
- That's enough, Verne.
- Good night, 273.

381
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,434
Spuddies…

382
00:24:28,435 --> 00:24:33,539
Cooler… Wagon…
Redder wagon.

383
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,841
Time's up, RJ.

384
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:38,477
But I have
six more days! No!

385
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,079
No! Aaah!

386
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:45,217
OK. Four paws, fur.

387
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:48,087
Still alive, still alive.

388
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:51,090
So, what are you saying? You want
me to take 'em to his house?

389
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:53,159
- No.
- Then what are you saying?

390
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,161
Jimmy was pushing me on the bus.

391
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,429
- He likes you.
- No way, he's a creep.

392
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,798
Next time he shoves you,
beat him up.

393
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,701
Yes!

394
00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:09,375
OK, kids, dive in. There it is.
Bark for breakfast!

395
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,278
- I want a doughnut!
- I want pizza.

396
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:13,646
No, you don't.

397
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:34,066
OK. This is great.

398
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,241
Granted, it takes
some time to chew.

399
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:45,077
But that…

400
00:25:45,078 --> 00:25:47,146
That was very satisfying.

401
00:25:47,147 --> 00:25:50,616
And, by the way,
lots of fiber in there too.

402
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:52,351
Mmm!

403
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:56,122
- Lots.
- I gotta admit, that does look tasty.

404
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:57,956
What are you doing here?

405
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:02,461
I'm here to help you with your…
foraging thing.

406
00:26:02,462 --> 00:26:03,829
Look, Verne,

407
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,832
you said a word yesterday
about your little gang here.

408
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:10,202
It starts with an F,
do you remember what it was?

409
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:12,271
- Family?
- Right, right, that.

410
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:14,606
You know,
that got me right here.

411
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,908
You see, Verne, I used
to have all of that.

412
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,812
My own place,
surrounded by loved ones,

413
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,514
universal remote.

414
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:25,217
But then all that
went away with…

415
00:26:25,218 --> 00:26:26,852
…the weed hacker
incident.

416
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:28,120
Oh, God.

417
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:31,190
Oh, come here.

418
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:33,525
Yeah, that feels good,
doesn't it?

419
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:35,927
- Oh, brother.
- Jeepers, Verne.

420
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,330
We could always use the
extra hand there, you know.

421
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:42,534
The weed hacker, Verne.
The weed hacker.

422
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:44,336
OK.

423
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:49,074
Not your problem.
I'll just go.

424
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,842
This is me…

425
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,211
…going.

426
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:53,979
- Been nice.
- Don't hit.

427
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,547
Really nice getting to know you.

428
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:58,384
Hey, I'm sure I'll see you
around the forest.

429
00:26:58,385 --> 00:27:00,619
- Take care.
- All right, all right.

430
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,855
Hey, uh, RJ?

431
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,591
You can… you can stay.

432
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:08,527
- Come here, ya big lug!
- No.

433
00:27:08,528 --> 00:27:10,962
I knew beneath this hard,
crispy outside

434
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,131
there was a soft,
nougat-y center in there.

435
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:17,169
- Do you mind if I call you Uncle Verne?
- With every bone in my body.

436
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:20,172
Great. Hey,
can I work with Hammy?

437
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:22,107
Wanna help me find my nuts?

438
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:24,243
Very tempting, Hammy,
very tempting.

439
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:27,145
But first,
I want to show you this.

440
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,114
You like this cookie?

441
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,616
Ohh ho ho ho!

442
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:33,285
- Well, this cookie's junk!
- I like a cookie.

443
00:27:33,286 --> 00:27:34,820
Easy, easy. Don't worry.

444
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,122
I know where we can get
some cookies so valuable

445
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:42,093
that they are hand delivered
by uniformed officers.

446
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:45,464
- The Doyles' is the yellow house.
- They only ordered one box.

447
00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:47,733
There they are. America's
most coveted cookies.

448
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:51,703
Love Handles, Skinny Mints,
Neener Neeners and Smackeroons.

449
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:54,873
- And guess what? They're all yours!
- Hoo hoo! Aah!

450
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:58,076
Whoa, Hamilton.
Hold on there, fella.

451
00:27:58,077 --> 00:28:00,279
I love your energy,
but you can't take 'em.

452
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,248
- You said they're mine.
- They will be,

453
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:06,685
if we successfully marry your manic
energy to my brilliant plan!

454
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,487
- You with me, kid?
- I… I… I…

455
00:28:08,488 --> 00:28:10,356
The I's have it!
Let's ride.

456
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:13,058
Mrs. Johansson
was allergic to chocolate.

457
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:14,893
- Really?
- Yeah, if she eats it,

458
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:18,864
- her face explodes or something.
- That is, like, so unfair.

459
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:21,032
- Wait, wait. How many boxes of…?
- Hey!

460
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,402
You stay away from those cookies.
They're mine!

461
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:25,437
- Ahem!
- Aah!

462
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:28,307
This guy's not coming, is he?
I don't want him to.

463
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:30,976
Oh, we have so much work to do.

464
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:33,445
Come on, step into my office.
Now, listen up.

465
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:37,383
What we're going for here is a
vicious, man-eating, rabid squirrel.

466
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,385
- Can you handle that?
- Um, excuse me?

467
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,420
Yes… Hammy.

468
00:28:41,421 --> 00:28:45,824
OK. Rabbits aren't vicious. They're
all cute and cuddly, so…

469
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:48,193
Rabid, not rabbit.

470
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,929
Oh… What?

471
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,732
- OK. So first we're gonna muss the hair.
- Ow, ow, ow!

472
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,901
That's looking good.
All right, now we're gonna…

473
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:58,670
We're gonna
mat the fur a little bit.

474
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:01,340
A little puff on the tail…
Stop it! Puffier.

475
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:02,674
Liking that a lot.

476
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:06,011
Show me that wild look
in your eye. Come on!

477
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:11,650
- Oh! I can burp my ABCs! A, B, C.
- Hammy!

478
00:29:11,651 --> 00:29:15,253
I just really need you
to focus right now, OK?

479
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,522
- OK.
- Thank you.

480
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:19,057
Let's see. There we…
Hang on a minute.

481
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:22,260
Not that, not that.
No, no. Aha!

482
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,697
- Nice!
- Ooh!

483
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:27,500
Hammy?

484
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:35,173
Done! Now, come on.
I'll be right behind you.

485
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:38,009
Go on, get out there.
Shoo, shoo!

486
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:43,048
I am a crazy rabid squirrel!
I want my cookies!

487
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:45,651
I'm rabid!

488
00:29:45,652 --> 00:29:48,019
I'm foaming at the mouth.

489
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:52,023
I'm foaming,
very scary rabid squirrel.

490
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,425
Rabies!

491
00:29:53,426 --> 00:29:55,327
- Hey, it's working!
- Behind you!

492
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,229
I know.
You're right behind me…

493
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,865
Got it! Stand back!

494
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:03,402
- No, no, no, no! Oh, no!
- Take that!

495
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:04,770
Walk it off!
Walk that one off!

496
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:07,005
What's going on?
Is that Hammy?

497
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:09,875
- Everything's under control. Go back.
- You call that under control?

498
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:11,810
- He's under attack!
- He's working!

499
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:14,279
- I'm coming, Hammy!
- Verne! No!

500
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,683
What are you doing?
Watch out!

501
00:30:22,355 --> 00:30:27,225
- Hold still! I got it! Stay still.
- Help me! Get off of me!

502
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:29,595
- Yuck!
- Gross!

503
00:30:29,596 --> 00:30:32,130
- Eww! Nasty!
- Eww, eww! Oh, my God, this is so gross!

504
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,499
Verne!

505
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,068
That was great! You, my
friend, are a natural.

506
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:40,939
Or, should I say, au naturel.

507
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,642
Huh?

508
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:45,611
Oh.

509
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:47,979
Hammy, you were awesome, my man!

510
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:52,117
You had me scared. I was about to come
out and beat you with a book myself.

511
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:55,821
You're all right, aren't ya? Of
course you are. You are Hammy!

512
00:30:55,822 --> 00:30:59,190
Those bruises are gonna heal. You
know what? Chicks dig scars.

513
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,192
- There!
- Over there!

514
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,696
That's where the squirrel attacked us!
He has rabies or something.

515
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,998
There was this gross,
naked, amphibian thing.

516
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:10,035
- Reptile.
- It's OK, girls.

517
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:13,038
Go inside, have a cookie,
turn on the TV and calm down.

518
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,506
Thanks, Mom.

519
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:18,243
I'm sorry, Janis, did I just
hear them say "rabidsquirrel"?

520
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:20,412
Oh, I think they might
just be overreacting.

521
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:24,315
What if they're not? What if we have
a potential pandemic on our hands?

522
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,585
Vermin running loose,
spreading disease

523
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:29,988
and lowering
our property values?

524
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:33,391
Yeah. I have a casserole
in the oven. Gotta run.

525
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,427
Fine. Worry about
your casserole,

526
00:31:35,428 --> 00:31:40,066
and I'll worry about the end of
suburban peace and tranquility!

527
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:45,471
That's right. Don't push.
Plenty for everybody.

528
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:47,706
Got a box right over here
for ya, Penny.

529
00:31:47,707 --> 00:31:49,708
That is good. Eat up!

530
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:52,310
Anything that tastes this good
has to be good for you.

531
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:55,614
Feel buzzing in the back of your skull?
That's called a sugar rush.

532
00:31:55,615 --> 00:32:00,351
It's what keeps humans going, why they
don't hibernate. Add a little of this,

533
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:04,355
and what usually takes you
all summer will take us a week.

534
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,991
I like it! I like it!

535
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:10,129
Hold on, Hamsquad. The last
thing you need is caffeine.

536
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,032
That's right.
Come on, dig in.

537
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:17,235
Because this, my friends,
is just the beginning.

538
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,737

Ozzie!

563
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:18,924
- Whoa, Mom! You hit a possum.
- Oh, my goodness.

564
00:34:18,925 --> 00:34:20,325
Do you think it's dead?

565
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:22,127
Oh, no.

566
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:24,395
- Wow!
- Touch it.

567
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,997
- Can I poke him?
- No!

568
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:28,166
These poor little creatures.

569
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,669
- What's going on?
- Come check it out.

570
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,806
Debbie? I don't remember seeing
a permit app for a gathering.

571
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:37,275
Groups of more than one
who wish to get… Aah!

572
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:40,278
Timmy, get the shovel
from the car.

573
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:47,786
Lights fading,
limbs growing cold.

574
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:51,089
- I see a tunnel.
- Oh, no.

575
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,963
Mother, is that you
beckoning me into the light?

576
00:34:57,964 --> 00:35:00,598
Must move toward the light.

577
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,569
- What do you think he's doing?
- Maybe we knocked his brains loose.

578
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,239
You went too far. Let's get
out of here and leave this…

579
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,808
This…

580
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:12,711
- Nice catch, Verne.
- Yes! Yes!

581
00:35:12,712 --> 00:35:17,448
- You're dangerous. You're insane!
- Sweet music, I'm going home!

582
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:22,754
Goodbye, cruel world!

583
00:35:22,755 --> 00:35:24,956
Ooh! Ooh!

584
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:29,294
Rosebud.

585
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,233
- Now can I poke him?
- No!

586
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:38,904
You see? This is exactly why
I called the exterminator.

587
00:35:38,905 --> 00:35:41,539
To kill them before
they get hurt like this.

588
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,374
Everybody,
get out of here right now!

589
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,977
Right! Kids, grab those handles.
Get the stuff.

590
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:49,380
- What?
- Here we go. I threw out my back.

591
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:54,821
- Let's go.
- Get down.

592
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,839
Oh, no.

593
00:36:18,077 --> 00:36:22,280
I believe someone phoned
about an animal problem?

594
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:25,083
The solution
is standing before you.

595
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:28,586
Dwayne LaFontant is here.

596
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:32,523
Where have you been? I'm throwing a
"Welcome to the Neighborhood" party,

597
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:35,693
and so far Debbie's car has killed
more animals than you have.

598
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,363
Stand down, sister.

599
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:39,798
I personally guarantee

600
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:43,001
that there will not be a
living thing at this party.

601
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:45,237
The Verminator is on the job.

602
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:48,373
Leave it. Leave it!

603
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:51,109
What do we have here?

604
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,545
Didelphis marsupialis
virginianus.

605
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,047
Approximately ten pounds.

606
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:59,818
Male.

607
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:01,719
- I think he's dead.
- Oh, really?

608
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,290
Do you, in fact, have an
associates degree from Vermtech?

609
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,258
I think he wants you
to think he's dead.

610
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:09,027
- Go! Go!
- Move, move!

611
00:37:09,028 --> 00:37:11,930
- That's it! Run! Go!
- …voluntary shock state.

612
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:14,365
Look at him closely.
You can see him breathing.

613
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:17,668
I certainly hope he's not in any pain.

614
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:20,405
- What the…?
- Aah! Kill it! Kill it!

615
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:23,374
Thank you all for coming!
You were a great audience!

616
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,911
Oh, man!

617
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:30,315
All right, what am I
up against here?

618
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:33,751
Possum, porcupine,
skunk, squirrel,

619
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,788
raccoon…
amphibian.

620
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:39,791
- Reptile.
- No.

621
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:41,994
Reptile.

622
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:48,800
That's what I call a
super-duper performance there.

623
00:37:48,801 --> 00:37:50,268
- I wanna do it again!
- Beyond super.

624
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:52,403
They were riveted.
You were awesome!

625
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,705
All right!

626
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:58,878
Dad. I just gotta say, that was, uh…
that was pretty good.

627
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:02,313
Props for the Ozman!

628
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:04,816
- Ozman!
- Yeah! Yeah!

629
00:38:04,817 --> 00:38:07,585
But let's not forget
our brilliant leadership:

630
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:09,320
RJ.

631
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:10,521
RJ!

632
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:12,290
Brilliant!

633
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,961
RJ, come this way.
We wanna show you something.

634
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:18,196
- Yeah, sure.
- Sweet.

635
00:38:18,197 --> 00:38:20,866
- What a team!
- That raccoon knows what he's doing.

636
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:23,369
You're my hero there, fella.

637
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:29,140
- Over here, this way.
- RJ, come on!

638
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:31,877
Yeah, we wanna show you
something. Come on, hurry!

639
00:38:31,878 --> 00:38:34,013
Check it out.

640
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,118
Your new home!

641
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:46,892
And look, we got
a place for you right here!

642
00:38:46,893 --> 00:38:48,159
That's for me?

643
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,031
Yeah, is this anything
like what you had, RJ?

644
00:38:53,032 --> 00:38:56,234
This isn't anything
like what I had, Lou.

645
00:38:56,235 --> 00:38:59,837
- Here, I'm not supposed to drink this.
- Thanks.

646
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:04,075
- Is that my bag?
- Yeah, we brought it in here

647
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:06,011
so you wouldn't have
to sleep in that tree.

648
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:08,479
Really? Wow.

649
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,482
Hey, RJ, check this out!
We totally hooked up the TV.

650
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:15,987
- I hot-wired the HD converter.
- We get a thousand channels!

651
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:18,189
Can you take the remote
before my dad does?

652
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,260
Wow. A universal remote?

653
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:27,398
This is nice, guys.
Really nice.

654
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:30,635
We now return to
A Scoundrel Among Us.

655
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:32,570
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

656
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:35,140
We let you into our family,
and you've deceived us.

657
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:39,510
I gave you my heart, and you
ripped it into a million pieces.

658
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:42,480
Get real, Kevin.
When you feel like a dirtbag,

659
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:44,649
it's because you're a dirtbag.

660
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:49,487
Right? So just own it, just say
it out loud. "I am a dirtbag."

661
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:53,158
Dirtbag. I don't think
that guy's a real doctor.

662
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:56,494
What do you think there,
RJ? RJ?

663
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:01,766
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, RJ.

664
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:06,037
What are you doing, man? You
are getting in way too deep.

665
00:40:06,038 --> 00:40:07,772
Just get the food.

666
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:09,975
Feed the bear.
Get the food.

667
00:40:09,976 --> 00:40:11,476
Feed the bear.
Whaah!

668
00:40:11,477 --> 00:40:14,045
Where's the food?
Where's the food?!

669
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:24,755
Verne. What are you doing?

670
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,657
Getting things back
to the way they were.

671
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:29,694
- No, don't. How about I just leave?
- Good.

672
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:32,430
You leave, and I return this
stuff to the rightful owners.

673
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,032
What?! Why?

674
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:36,601
Because we've angered
the humans.

675
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:38,869
And we don't wanna end up
like that rabbit.

676
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:44,009
Hence, I'm giving this back
so they won't kill us.

677
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:47,745
Verne, you don't understand!
We need this stuff!

678
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,480
No, we don't!

679
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:51,682
You can't take it!

680
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:52,883
Yes, I can!

681
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:54,952
- Let go!
- You let go!

682
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,955
- I have to have it.
- No!

683
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,192
Stop!

684
00:41:10,436 --> 00:41:14,172
Verne. Move slow, keep your
voice low and follow me.

685
00:41:14,173 --> 00:41:17,708
- What?
- Shh!

686
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,444
- No.
- Shh!

687
00:41:19,445 --> 00:41:24,615
No. I'm not falling for any
more of your smooth talk!

688
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:28,953
I don't know what you're up to,
but my entire shell is tingling.

689
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:30,955
Know what? I'm listening
to it this time,

690
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:33,091
- and I'm putting my foot down.
- No, no.

691
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:36,494
Play?

692
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:39,630
Huh? Oh! Huh?

693
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:41,866
Play!

694
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,234
Play! Play! Play!

695
00:41:43,235 --> 00:41:46,837
Play! Play! Play!
Play! Play!

696
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,107
Aaah! Oof!

697
00:41:49,108 --> 00:41:51,176
Play!

698
00:41:58,217 --> 00:42:00,552
Let's play!

699
00:42:03,422 --> 00:42:04,822
Play!

700
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:07,092
Jeez… Aah!

701
00:42:07,093 --> 00:42:09,527
Play! Play! Play!
Play! Play! Play!

702
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:13,231
- Down, boy. Sit. Roll over!
- Play!

703
00:42:13,232 --> 00:42:15,301
- Play dead!
- Play!

704
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:20,037
Attaboy, Verne. Save the food.
I'll lose the dog.

705
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,239
- Play.
- Huh?

706
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,840
Play, play, play, play.

707
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:24,343
Play, play, play, play.

708
00:42:28,147 --> 00:42:32,083
Oh, no! No, no, no, no.

709
00:42:32,084 --> 00:42:34,352
You're dropping
all the food, man!

710
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:37,822
- Here, catch.
- Play!

711
00:42:37,823 --> 00:42:39,591
Are you hungry?
Look, food.

712
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:44,462
- Oh, my back!
- Whoa!

713
00:42:44,463 --> 00:42:46,564
Look, people!
Play with them!

714
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:49,367
- Look out!
- Stop! What's he doing?

715
00:42:49,368 --> 00:42:52,170
- What was that?
- Play, play, play, play.

716
00:42:52,171 --> 00:42:55,274
I'm all right,
I'm fine. It's OK. It's…

717
00:42:59,111 --> 00:43:01,213
Verne, unhook the chain.

718
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,585
Play!

719
00:43:08,954 --> 00:43:10,421
No.

720
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:11,922
Yes.

721
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,325
Bad.

722
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:17,763
- Oh, boy.
- Wow!

723
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:27,673
Verne, I told you
to unhook the chain.

724
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:48,160
Garbage cans are not to be
on the curb before eight…

725
00:43:49,195 --> 00:43:51,463
Aah!

726
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,843
You're the devil.

727
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:11,617
Ow! Oh! Ow!

728
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:23,428
No! No!

729
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:25,162
Verne, you all right there?

730
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,465
- Gimme a hand, Oz.
- Sure, sure.

731
00:44:27,466 --> 00:44:29,234
- What happened?
- What happened?

732
00:44:29,235 --> 00:44:32,903
It's gone.
The food! Gone!

733
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:34,138
- What?
- Gone?

734
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:37,475
- How's it gone?
- Ask him!

735
00:44:37,476 --> 00:44:40,578
- Verne?
- I returned it

736
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:43,180
- to its rightful owner.
- What?

737
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:45,650
We, like, worked
our tails off, you know?

738
00:44:45,651 --> 00:44:48,886
Like, a lot. And the food
we gathered was totally…

739
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:51,856
You know. And you're…
You're all, whatever.

740
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:54,959
Yeah, Verne, what were you thinking?
The log was full!

741
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,928
- Full of junk.
- So, what are you saying there?

742
00:44:57,929 --> 00:45:02,733
That the food we gather our way isn't
as good as the food we gather your way?

743
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:05,169
Your way?
You mean his way.

744
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,338
Can't you see RJ
is just using you?

745
00:45:07,339 --> 00:45:11,008
Verne! Shame on you.
RJ wouldn't do that.

746
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:13,878
You have got to trust me on this.
Don't you understand

747
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:15,746
there's something
wrong with him?

748
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:18,583
My tail tingles
every time I get near him.

749
00:45:18,584 --> 00:45:21,919
So we're supposed to go hungry
because your butt's vibrating?

750
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,590
I'm starting to think that tingle
is just you being jealous.

751
00:45:25,591 --> 00:45:27,992
- Jealous? Of him?
- Yeah.

752
00:45:27,993 --> 00:45:31,662
He's embracing the future there,
and you're just holding us back.

753
00:45:31,663 --> 00:45:34,231
I hold you back, all right.
From extinction.

754
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,800
See what you've done here?

755
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:38,135
If they listened to half the
stuff you're telling them,

756
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:42,039
they'll be dead within a week. You are
only interested in taking advantage

757
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,910
because they're too stupid
and naive to know any better.

758
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:50,949
I'm not stupid.

759
00:45:53,685 --> 00:45:56,921
OK, I didn't mean…
Uh…

760
00:45:56,922 --> 00:45:58,757
I meant ignorant.

761
00:45:59,825 --> 00:46:04,161
To the ways over…
over there.

762
00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:07,164
Come on, you guys. You know
I didn't mean it like that.

763
00:46:07,165 --> 00:46:08,999
Don't… don't do this.

764
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,637
Stella? Ozzie?

765
00:46:12,638 --> 00:46:14,873
Hammy?
You know I didn't…

766
00:46:17,509 --> 00:46:21,846
- Hammy…
- I'm not stupid.

767
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:25,516

797
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:09,720
- Is it done?
- Affirmative.

798
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:12,289
Did you put this one in?
This Depelter Turbo?

799
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:14,058
That's a contraband item, ma'am,

800
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:17,795
as it is illegal
in every state, except Texas.

801
00:48:17,796 --> 00:48:20,197
I don't care if it's against
the Geneva Convention.

802
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:23,468
- I want it!
- I thought you might.

803
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:26,538
So I took the liberty
of installing it for you.

804
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:32,443
Adios, animal infestation.

805
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:35,580
Aah!

806
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:37,649

00:48:57,869 --> 00:49:00,838
- Shouldn't have taken all that food.
- What?

812
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,640
I shouldn't have taken
all that food.

813
00:49:02,641 --> 00:49:05,943
I was just trying to return
things to the way they were.

814
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:09,079
I was just being cautious.
'Cause that's what I am.

815
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,915
I'm naturally tentative.

816
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:13,684
There's even places
in my shell I haven't been.

817
00:49:13,685 --> 00:49:16,286
You, on the other hand,
you're like… cool.

818
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,923
And crazy and fearless.

819
00:49:18,924 --> 00:49:22,593
I think they're right.
I think I'm just jealous.

820
00:49:22,594 --> 00:49:24,929
Verne, believe me,

821
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:27,765
you should not be jealous of me.

822
00:49:27,766 --> 00:49:31,602
You got a good thing here. You're trying
to do what's best for your family.

823
00:49:31,603 --> 00:49:34,639
And I think you're
what's best for them now.

824
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,474
What about your tail?

825
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:42,179
My head says listen to my tail, my tail
says listen to my head, and I just…

826
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,815
…end up
with an upset stomach.

827
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,984
That's why you need
to be in charge now.

828
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:50,087
- You don't know what's going on.
- And you do.

829
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:53,524
- So, what's the problem?
- This, Verne, is the problem.

830
00:49:53,525 --> 00:49:55,760
- You see this?
- I'm listening.

831
00:49:55,761 --> 00:49:57,695
Just…

832
00:49:57,696 --> 00:50:01,098
Just hang on a second.
All right?

833
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:02,332
I, uh…

834
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,736
- You throwing the party?
- Yes. To the right.

835
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:09,006
There are protective booties
to put on over your shoes.

836
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:11,609
Yes! Yes!

837
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:16,046
- Uh, what is this?
- What?

838
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:19,149
- Oh, that…
- Mm-hmm.

839
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,284
…is a…

840
00:50:20,285 --> 00:50:23,053
…list of all the stuff
that you lost, Verne.

841
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:25,823
- Really?
- It's a big, long list. You can see.

842
00:50:25,824 --> 00:50:29,193
You're a… organized little
guy, aren't you? Nice job.

843
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:31,996
You know what? I know a place
so chock-full of food,

844
00:50:31,997 --> 00:50:33,898
we could get it
all back in one night.

845
00:50:33,899 --> 00:50:35,933
Great. Let's go.
Where is it?

846
00:50:35,934 --> 00:50:38,570
- Inside that house.
- What?

847
00:50:40,972 --> 00:50:45,075
- What is the point of this thing?
- Just send it down.

848
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:47,144
What Verne
is trying to say is…

849
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:50,648
I mean, it's hard to really sum
it all up in just one word.

850
00:50:50,649 --> 00:50:54,251
- But…
- I'm sorry.

851
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:55,886
Oh, come here.

852
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:59,023
- Oh, come here, Verne.
- That's right.

853
00:50:59,024 --> 00:51:02,159
OK! Listen, stay in the huddle.
Here's the plan.

854
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,097
Now, the traps are set
here, here, here,

855
00:51:07,098 --> 00:51:11,301
here, here, here,
here, here, here,

856
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:16,373
here, here, here and here.

857
00:51:16,374 --> 00:51:22,212
Here, here, here, here.

858
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:25,249
Big one here, here,

859
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:28,085
- and maybe a few over here.
- Gee, is that all?

860
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:31,421
No. There's a bunch
of red lights all over here.

861
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,123
OK, Verne?
Looking a little green.

862
00:51:33,124 --> 00:51:36,026
I blacked out for a second
there, but I get the idea.

863
00:51:36,027 --> 00:51:39,229
There's lights, traps… I
might need to change my shell.

864
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,999
OK, this is us.

865
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,034
- Can I be the car?
- I wanna be the car!

866
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:47,304
- I'm the car. You be the shoe.
- The shoe is lame.

867
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:50,274
Why don't you be
that snazzy-looking iron?

868
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:51,776
Hey, it's not important!

869
00:51:51,777 --> 00:51:54,712
Besides, I'm the car.
I'm always the car.

870
00:51:54,713 --> 00:51:58,282
The plan works in three simple steps.
Step one, kill the lights.

871
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:02,186
Step two, get inside. Step three,
get out with mountain of food.

872
00:52:02,187 --> 00:52:03,988
But this place
is like a fortress.

873
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:07,124
Walls, so high.
Doors, impenetrable.

874
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:10,061
- How will we get in?
- The collar is the key.

875
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:13,097
Literally, the collar.

876
00:52:13,098 --> 00:52:15,465
It's like a key that opens
the door and if…

877
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:19,003
And what? You think he's just gonna
hand over his collar to you?

878
00:52:19,004 --> 00:52:21,438
Not to me,
my femme fatale. To you.

879
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:22,773
- Her?
- Me?

880
00:52:22,774 --> 00:52:24,208
You, Stella, will get that cat

881
00:52:24,209 --> 00:52:26,443
to give you
his collar by using…

882
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:29,646
- My stink.
- …your feminine charms.

883
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,349
Was that out loud?

884
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:36,987
Look, raccoon, maybe that mask you're
wearing is obstructing your view,

885
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:40,324
but if you haven't noticed,
I'm a skunk.

886
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:41,726
On the outside, maybe.

887
00:52:41,727 --> 00:52:44,228
But I'm looking inside,
Stella, and I see a fox.

888
00:52:44,229 --> 00:52:47,431
And all we gotta do
is get her out.

889
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:53,871
- Scissors.
- Scissors?

890
00:52:53,872 --> 00:52:55,539
- Here we go.
- Watch the…

891
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,943
- Charcoal.
- Charcoal?

892
00:52:58,944 --> 00:53:00,577
- Air freshener.
- Tomato juice.

893
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:02,913
- Cork.
- Cork? Don't you dare.

894
00:53:05,951 --> 00:53:08,820
- Get 'em!
- Score! Yeah!

895
00:53:11,857 --> 00:53:14,391
- One more thing.
- Ow!

896
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:16,060
Stop. That's it.

897
00:53:16,061 --> 00:53:19,831
Ladies and gentlemen,
our work here is done.

898
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:22,733
Oh, my.

899
00:53:22,734 --> 00:53:26,336
- Big jeepers.
- She's all like, wow.

900
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:28,206
What?

901
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:31,743
Oh.

902
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,149
Meow.

903
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,918
- Whoa!
- Amazing!

904
00:53:40,919 --> 00:53:43,287
Gosh, she looks…

905
00:53:43,288 --> 00:53:45,190
Wow.

906
00:53:50,095 --> 00:53:54,165
All right, gang, this is it.
We're going in.

907
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:06,110
Not again. Dang it!
Those things are so lifelike.

908
00:54:06,111 --> 00:54:09,848
Curse you, plastic moldsman.

909
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:29,100
OK, Hammy.

910
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:33,570
Hammy!

911
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:50,020
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

912
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:53,357
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

913
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:56,693
Hammy, I told you
that cookie's junk!

914
00:54:56,694 --> 00:54:58,528
But I like a cookie.

915
00:54:58,529 --> 00:55:01,967
What's going on?
Is everything OK?

916
00:55:07,906 --> 00:55:09,773
Ha ha! Here we go!

917
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:15,080
Come on, Hammy, come on. Follow the
pretty light. There it is, that's it.

918
00:55:16,214 --> 00:55:18,015
That's it, that's it.

919
00:55:18,016 --> 00:55:20,351
There it is. Go get it.

920
00:55:25,123 --> 00:55:28,059
Mm-hmm.
That's it, that's it.

921
00:55:30,128 --> 00:55:32,262
Go get it, you little nut!

922
00:55:32,263 --> 00:55:35,900
Bingo! OK, step two.

923
00:55:35,901 --> 00:55:38,937
I thought we'd be dead by step
two, so this is going great!

924
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:43,909
OK, gorgeous, you're on.

925
00:55:46,277 --> 00:55:49,779
Man, this better be
one stupid cat.

926
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,616
Audio, go!

927
00:55:55,086 --> 00:55:56,420
She's supposed to be a cat.

928
00:55:56,421 --> 00:55:59,789
Put it on cat.
Maybe the cat likes a cow.

929
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,959
Who goes there?

930
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,994
You're a cat!
You're a cat!

931
00:56:03,995 --> 00:56:05,762
You're a cat!

932
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:08,332
Uh, I mean, I'm a cat.
Uh…

933
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:11,101
- Meow.
- Yeah, right.

934
00:56:11,102 --> 00:56:13,103
Shoo. Go on,
get away from here.

935
00:56:13,104 --> 00:56:16,240
My owner does not give
scraps to common strays.

936
00:56:16,241 --> 00:56:18,842
Common strays?
All right, you asked for it.

937
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:22,112
- Get the collar!
- Gee, that's a nice collar you got on.

938
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:24,848
- Mind if I have a look?
- No! Come no closer!

939
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:28,318
I must not be so near a
creature of the outdoor woods.

940
00:56:29,988 --> 00:56:33,490
- Away with your filth!
- My filth?

941
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:35,825
- My filth?!
- Oh, jeepers, here we go.

942
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:40,030
OK, that's it. I am sick and tired
of everybody taking one look at me

943
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:42,299
and running away
'cause they think I'm filthy.

944
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,234
Well, I got news for you.

945
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:47,771
I didn't get all primped and preened to
have some over-fed, pompous puffball

946
00:56:47,772 --> 00:56:52,009
tell me he's too good for me.
I got makeup on my butt, dude!

947
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:54,144
And you don't even
wanna know about the cork!

948
00:56:54,145 --> 00:56:58,449
Stop! No one has ever
spoken to me like that!

949
00:57:00,051 --> 00:57:03,488
It is bold. I like it.

950
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,759
Well, believe me, there's
more where that came from…

951
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,197
- …puffball.
- All right, team, let's boogie.

952
00:57:13,198 --> 00:57:16,733
You are strong.
Your essence is overpowering.

953
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:19,936
- What…? What do you mean by that?
- It is your eyes.

954
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:23,840
- My eyes.
- They are luminous.

955
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:26,643
Luminous? Dang.

956
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:29,446
You know, I think this is the
part where I blacked out.

957
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:32,116
Did the little shoes and cars
actually get into the house?

958
00:57:34,052 --> 00:57:36,653
- So you got a name?
- Yes.

959
00:57:36,654 --> 00:57:39,956
It is a Persian name,
for I am Persian.

960
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:43,493
I was born Prince
Tigeriess Mahmood Shabaz.

961
00:57:43,494 --> 00:57:47,565
Ooh, that's a mouthful.
Can I just call you Tiger?

962
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,670
- This place is huge.
- Wicked cool.

963
00:57:53,671 --> 00:57:56,641
Animals are in the house.

964
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:07,117
Wow!

965
00:58:07,118 --> 00:58:11,555
- Oh, my goodness.
- This is so cool.

966
00:58:11,556 --> 00:58:15,259
- Yes! OK, stations, everybody.
- Let's boogie!

967
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,460
- We got it.
- Here we go.

968
00:58:16,461 --> 00:58:19,463
No grip, no grip, no grip.

969
00:58:19,464 --> 00:58:24,034
- Hammy! Less claw, more pad.
- Oh, OK.

970
00:58:24,035 --> 00:58:25,603
That hurt.

971
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:32,676
Uh-oh.

972
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:36,513
- Just a minute, I'll be right there.
- What was that?

973
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:40,084
It… That's just the sound of my heart.
Can't you hear it?

974
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:46,190
Aaah!

975
00:58:46,191 --> 00:58:48,593
This way, this way!

976
00:58:53,398 --> 00:58:57,201
OK, OK, we're good.
Go back to work.

977
00:58:57,202 --> 00:58:59,503
There ya go.

978
00:58:59,504 --> 00:59:01,306
Here, catch!

979
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,413
Oh, boy.

980
00:59:09,414 --> 00:59:11,815
Yes, I'm gonna make it.

981
00:59:11,816 --> 00:59:15,485
My father, he had
an exceptionally flat face.

982
00:59:15,486 --> 00:59:18,622
He was so beautiful,
he could barely breathe.

983
00:59:18,623 --> 00:59:20,090
Fascinating.

984
00:59:20,091 --> 00:59:24,027
…inside, I have a multi-leveled
climby-thing with shag carpet.

985
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:26,130
- Come, I show you.
- No, no!

986
00:59:26,131 --> 00:59:27,731
I haven't told you
about my life.

987
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:29,666
Good, good.
Going great, going great.

988
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:33,403
What is that?

989
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:36,873
That is what gets the humans
out of bed in the morning.

990
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:40,410
Where'd she go?

991
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:41,812
Get down and stay down.

992
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:50,721
Move. Move.

993
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,210
Come on! We've gotta go
before she comes back.

994
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:15,779
- No! Not without those Spuddies.
- What?

995
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:19,716
Lou, Penny, back to the TV.
Heather, keep an eye on that human.

996
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:22,085
- I'm on it, RJ.
- No, Heather. Wait!

997
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:24,454
The tingle, the tingle.

998
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:26,823
RJ! The wagon's full,
let's get out of here.

999
01:00:26,824 --> 01:00:29,025
Hang on, Vincent,
this'll only take a second

1000
01:00:29,026 --> 01:00:30,394
- Vincent?
- Where?

1001
01:00:30,395 --> 01:00:32,762
- Who's Vincent?
- Oh, Verne, Vincent.

1002
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:35,732
Simple slip of the bear.
Tongue! I… er…

1003
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:40,136
Just bear with me is what
I meant to say.

1004
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42,640
There's no bear.

1005
01:00:45,543 --> 01:00:49,280
Lights fading.
Limbs growing co…

1006
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,449
Heather.

1007
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:03,427
Oh, Heather!

1008
01:01:03,428 --> 01:01:06,564
There's a dead, white rat
on my staircase.

1009
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:12,202
I thought you were dead.

1010
01:01:12,203 --> 01:01:14,204
I learned from the best, Dad.

1011
01:01:14,205 --> 01:01:16,540
That's my girl.

1012
01:01:16,541 --> 01:01:18,642
Come to Papa.

1013
01:01:18,643 --> 01:01:21,311
We better hurry.
We don't have much time.

1014
01:01:21,312 --> 01:01:22,979
- What's going on, RJ?
- Nothing!

1015
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,382
Let's get out of here because
we have what we need.

1016
01:01:25,383 --> 01:01:27,651
- No, we don't.
- What are you talking about?

1017
01:01:27,652 --> 01:01:29,953
- We have more than enough.
- Hey, listen.

1018
01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:33,122
I've got this long to hand over that
wagon of food to a homicidal bear.

1019
01:01:33,123 --> 01:01:37,661
If these Spuddies aren't on the menu,
then I will be. Now let go of my tail.

1020
01:01:37,662 --> 01:01:39,529
What?

1021
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,965
Let go!

1022
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:46,636
Hey, whoa!

1023
01:01:46,637 --> 01:01:48,338
Huh?

1024
01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:50,006
Uh, I'm sorry, I've gotta go.

1025
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:55,746
Stella, Stella, where are you going?
Stella!

1026
01:01:57,382 --> 01:02:00,784
- Aaah!
- Stella!

1027
01:02:00,785 --> 01:02:05,855
Look, it's not you. It won't
work, OK, because I'm a…

1028
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:07,491
Skunk!

1029
01:02:07,492 --> 01:02:10,560
Yeah, that. Sorry
you have to see this.

1030
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:11,929
Fire in the hole!

1031
01:02:17,034 --> 01:02:20,770
- Oh, my…
- This smell doesn't bother you?

1032
01:02:20,771 --> 01:02:24,107
No. This face
was bred for beauty.

1033
01:02:24,108 --> 01:02:26,009
I cannot smell a thing.

1034
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:28,513
You can't smell?

1035
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:39,289
To the door!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1036
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:40,691
- Run!
- This way!

1037
01:02:44,529 --> 01:02:47,431
Let's party.

1038
01:02:47,432 --> 01:02:49,466
- Bunnies!
- Aah!

1039
01:02:49,467 --> 01:02:52,869
Flee, my love.

1040
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,971
Run, that way. Outside!

1041
01:02:54,972 --> 01:02:57,274
Move, kids! Come on!

1042
01:03:01,078 --> 01:03:04,482
Buenos dÃ­as, reptile.

1043
01:03:09,454 --> 01:03:11,287
You've just been verminated.

1044
01:03:12,523 --> 01:03:14,924
Whoa! You stink.

1045
01:03:14,925 --> 01:03:18,995
That's because you let them
into my… house!

1046
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:21,398
- Those…
- Hey, Nancy, stop your honkin'.

1047
01:03:21,399 --> 01:03:24,934
These little guys will be
disposed of quickly and humanely.

1048
01:03:24,935 --> 01:03:28,873
No! Not humanely.
As inhumanely as possible.

1049
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:34,945
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, ma'am.

1050
01:03:51,429 --> 01:03:56,666
- What's he gonna do to us, Mama?
- I don't know, baby.

1051
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:59,636
I don't wanna die, Dad.
Not for real.

1052
01:03:59,637 --> 01:04:03,508
There, there, there,
sweetheart. We'll be OK.

1053
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:09,813
You were right about him, Verne.

1054
01:04:09,814 --> 01:04:12,782
We shoulda listened.
Sorry there.

1055
01:04:12,783 --> 01:04:16,152
No.

1056
01:04:16,153 --> 01:04:21,257
I knew we couldn't trust him,
and I got us into this.

1057
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:24,429
I should've known better.

1058
01:04:31,135 --> 01:04:32,736
Wow!

1059
01:04:32,737 --> 01:04:33,737
Vincent?

1060
01:04:33,738 --> 01:04:36,740
So I was on my way
down here to kill you.

1061
01:04:36,741 --> 01:04:40,645
But I stopped to watch the show,
and I gotta say…

1062
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:44,714
…that, right there,

1063
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:46,383
is a thing of beauty.

1064
01:04:48,653 --> 01:04:52,221
That is the most vicious,
deceitful,

1065
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:56,526
self-serving thing I've ever seen.

1066
01:04:56,527 --> 01:04:58,528
Classic RJ.

1067
01:04:58,529 --> 01:05:02,733
You take the food,
and they take the fall.

1068
01:05:07,605 --> 01:05:11,274
You keep this up, you're
gonna end up just like me.

1069
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:14,711
Having everything
you ever wanted.

1070
01:05:14,712 --> 01:05:17,447
But I already had that.

1071
01:05:17,448 --> 01:05:20,984
What, them?
Who are you kidding?

1072
01:05:20,985 --> 01:05:25,121
You said it yourself,
you're a family of one.

1073
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:26,890
Always will be.

1074
01:05:26,891 --> 01:05:29,759
It's how guys like
you and me survive.

1075
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,029
So a few saps
got hurt in the process.

1076
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:39,202
Tough. That's life.
Trust me, you don't need them.

1077
01:05:39,203 --> 01:05:42,439
Actually, I do.

1078
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:47,845
And right now,
they really need me.

1079
01:05:49,013 --> 01:05:51,080
So I really need this!

1080
01:05:51,081 --> 01:05:52,850
RJ!

1081
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,058
What the…?

1082
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:10,200
- There goes my back again.
- Are you OK?

1083
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:16,540
You sorry sack of rat dung.

1084
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:20,777
Whoa, Stella, this is a rescue.
I'm rescuing you.

1085
01:06:20,778 --> 01:06:23,847
I'm gonna gas you so hard
your grandchildren'll stink.

1086
01:06:23,848 --> 01:06:25,414
- Bear!
- What's that?

1087
01:06:25,415 --> 01:06:26,783
- Bear!
- Hair?

1088
01:06:26,784 --> 01:06:28,251
- Bear!
- Dare?

1089
01:06:28,252 --> 01:06:30,921
- Bear!
- Oh, bear!

1090
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,195
What?

1091
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:42,832
- We're out of control!
- We can drive.

1092
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:46,003
- It's just like Auto-Homicide 3!
- What?

1093
01:06:50,374 --> 01:06:54,644
Verne, let me in!
Wrong button! Wrong button!

1094
01:06:54,645 --> 01:06:57,146
Please select destination.

1095
01:06:57,147 --> 01:07:00,049
Take us home!
Take us to the log!

1096
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:03,386
Previous destination selected.
Make a legal U-turn.

1097
01:07:03,387 --> 01:07:05,289
We got it!

1098
01:07:08,659 --> 01:07:11,394
- Hammy! Let me in!
- Not listening to RJ.

1099
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:14,864
Kids, lose that bear!

1100
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:16,465
What weapons do we have?

1101
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:19,136
- We've got a hammer.
- Cool.

1102
01:07:20,605 --> 01:07:22,907
You little…

1103
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:26,242
Thank you. Yes, yes! Hey!

1104
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:29,579
- Let me in, let me in!
- No! Ring-tailed charlatan!

1105
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:30,880
Ozzie!

1106
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:32,982
He's trying to help us.
Just let him in.

1107
01:07:32,983 --> 01:07:36,620
- After what he did to us?
- But he came back.

1108
01:07:36,621 --> 01:07:38,321
And he brought a bear.

1109
01:07:40,758 --> 01:07:43,092
Hey! No fighting
while we're driving.

1110
01:07:43,093 --> 01:07:45,995
We will turn this van
around, mister.

1111
01:07:45,996 --> 01:07:48,264
He started it.

1112
01:07:48,265 --> 01:07:50,399
I'm telling you,
he's trying to help us.

1113
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,070
But, Verne, you're the one who
always says trust your tail.

1114
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:56,973
- But it's not tingling.
- Oh!

1115
01:07:56,974 --> 01:08:01,210
- Why didn't you say so?
- Hey!

1116
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:02,579
Thank you, thank you.

1117
01:08:04,682 --> 01:08:07,050
- You're dead, RJ!
- Duck!

1118
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:09,687
- And your friends are next.
- Look out!

1119
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:13,389
Make an immediate left turn.

1120
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:15,092
Whoa!

1121
01:08:17,094 --> 01:08:18,828
Bonus points!

1122
01:08:18,829 --> 01:08:20,798
Huh?

1123
01:08:28,138 --> 01:08:29,338
Yeah!

1124
01:08:29,339 --> 01:08:32,175
Ohh!

1125
01:08:32,176 --> 01:08:35,144
RJ!

1126
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:36,212
- Yeah!
- Oh!

1127
01:08:36,213 --> 01:08:38,715
- Look out.
- High score.

1128
01:08:38,716 --> 01:08:41,151
No, no, no, no!

1129
01:09:00,805 --> 01:09:03,406
You have arrived.

1130
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:08,813
Everybody all right?

1131
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:13,216
- Come on!
- We've gotta go, we've gotta go!

1132
01:09:13,217 --> 01:09:15,919
The old jazz dance injury.

1133
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,089
- Come on, come on. Quillo!
- Go, go, go.

1134
01:09:23,928 --> 01:09:25,829
- Did we make it?
- That was close!

1135
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:27,130
- All right!
- Are we here?

1136
01:09:27,131 --> 01:09:29,799
Penny? The kids here?
Hammy?

1137
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,269
Scary clown.

1138
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:41,678
Look out!

1139
01:09:46,884 --> 01:09:50,954
A weed hacker, Verne.
A weed hacker!

1140
01:09:50,955 --> 01:09:53,923
- Hey!
- Up, up, go up.

1141
01:09:53,924 --> 01:09:57,961
Show your little rat faces.
Filthy creatures.

1142
01:09:57,962 --> 01:10:00,396
Stay in the woods
where you belong.

1143
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:02,966
Watch out!

1144
01:10:06,771 --> 01:10:11,408
You guys wanna party, do ya?
All right, then, let's party.

1145
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:15,144
- Mom!
- Kids!

1146
01:10:15,145 --> 01:10:20,016
Penny, Lou,
look out! Down!

1147
01:10:20,017 --> 01:10:24,253
That's it! Verne, get everybody
out of here. I'll distract him.

1148
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:27,223
- Are you crazy? He'll kill you.
- Well, I'm the one he wants.

1149
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:29,092
Take care of your family, Verne.

1150
01:10:29,093 --> 01:10:31,260
I intend to.
The whole family.

1151
01:10:31,261 --> 01:10:34,464
- There's got to be something we can do.
- There's no time.

1152
01:10:36,901 --> 01:10:38,468
Hammy!

1153
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:44,673
Ahh.

1154
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:46,876
Hey, Vincent.
You were right.

1155
01:10:46,877 --> 01:10:50,479
With a Spuddie,
enough just isn't enough.

1156
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,682
RJ!

1157
01:10:53,683 --> 01:10:55,952
Now, Hammy. Go, go, go!

1158
01:10:55,953 --> 01:10:58,522
OK…

1159
01:11:34,691 --> 01:11:38,328
I got the cookie.

1160
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:12,196
- Huh?
- Ohh.

1161
01:12:18,435 --> 01:12:22,438
- That's the…
- The Depelter Turbo.

1162
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:26,109
Prepare for a lot of stinging.

1163
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:29,213
Oh, no!
No, no! No, no! No!

1164
01:12:41,926 --> 01:12:44,227
- Ouch!
- My hair!

1165
01:12:44,228 --> 01:12:46,630
That stung like I knew it would!

1166
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:00,910
- Yeah!
- All right!

1167
01:13:00,911 --> 01:13:03,646
Good job, everybody.
That's teamwork.

1168
01:13:03,647 --> 01:13:06,215
Come here, Hammy, come here.
You are a genius, my boy.

1169
01:13:06,216 --> 01:13:10,053
Oh, thank…
you.

1170
01:13:10,054 --> 01:13:12,956
And, Verne, don't you
ever fix this shell!

1171
01:13:12,957 --> 01:13:15,291
Yeah.
Glad it's working for ya.

1172
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:17,093
Take it off, give it back.

1173
01:13:17,094 --> 01:13:20,829
Here we go, off to the
Rockies for you, Smoky.

1174
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:23,399
Now, you do realize
that was a Depelter Turbo?

1175
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,501
Officer, please.
It was that Verminator.

1176
01:13:25,502 --> 01:13:28,671
He sold it to me. This has
nothing to do with me.

1177
01:13:28,672 --> 01:13:30,139
Hey, hey, it was in your yard.

1178
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:32,641
Your name's on the contract,
so tell it to the judge.

1179
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:35,011
- No! It's not my fault! Let go of me!
- Ma'am…

1180
01:13:35,012 --> 01:13:39,182
I can't be arrested! I'm the president
of the homeowner's association!

1181
01:13:39,183 --> 01:13:40,783
Take her down!

1182
01:13:40,784 --> 01:13:42,851
She's getting away!

1183
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:48,024
- We got a twitcher! Watch it! Ma'am!
- Get her!

1184
01:13:48,025 --> 01:13:49,925
- Stop that!
- Can I get help over here?

1185
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:51,527
Somebody get a hold of her legs!

1186
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:53,062
- Play?
- Oh, no!

1187
01:13:53,063 --> 01:13:56,699
No, no! No, no! Aah!

1188
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:58,167
High five, Hammy!

1189
01:13:58,168 --> 01:14:00,069
- Yes!
- It worked!

1190
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:02,171
We did it!

1191
01:14:02,172 --> 01:14:05,208
- Oh, yes!
- Stella!

1192
01:14:05,209 --> 01:14:07,043
- Stella!
- Over here, Tiger.

1193
01:14:07,044 --> 01:14:08,578
Oh, Stella.

1194
01:14:10,114 --> 01:14:15,084
So this is the outdoor
woods? I like it.

1195
01:14:15,085 --> 01:14:18,087
Come on, big boy.
You're coming with me.

1196
01:14:18,088 --> 01:14:21,390
You know, RJ, um,
just for the record,

1197
01:14:21,391 --> 01:14:24,227
if you had told us that all that
food you were trying to get

1198
01:14:24,228 --> 01:14:27,763
was to pay back an angry bear,
we would've given it to you.

1199
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:31,234
- Really?
- Yeah, that's what families do.

1200
01:14:31,235 --> 01:14:33,302
They look out for each other.

1201
01:14:33,303 --> 01:14:35,104
I've never had
anything like that.

1202
01:14:35,105 --> 01:14:39,175
I know.
But believe me, this…

1203
01:14:39,176 --> 01:14:42,045
This is the gateway
to the good life.

1204
01:14:42,046 --> 01:14:43,912
Wish you would've
told me that sooner.

1205
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:47,550
Well, that's bad communication.
Also something families do.

1206
01:14:47,551 --> 01:14:50,520
So, what do you say?
You wanna be a part of it?

1207
01:14:55,692 --> 01:15:01,230
Come here, come here. I
promised I wouldn't do this. OK.

1208
01:15:01,231 --> 01:15:03,266
Welcome to the family!

1209
01:15:03,267 --> 01:15:05,000
- Hey!
- Group hug!

1210
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,869
OK, OK.

1211
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:09,438
What a first week of spring.

1212
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:13,109
Wait a minute! That means there's
only 267 days left till winter.

1213
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:14,943
What are we gonna do for food?

1214
01:15:14,944 --> 01:15:16,745
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh!

1215
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:18,981
Yes, Hammy.

1216
01:15:18,982 --> 01:15:20,683
I filled the log.

1217
01:15:20,684 --> 01:15:23,586
- Jeepers!
- What…?

1218
01:15:23,587 --> 01:15:26,722
Look, look!
I found my nuts! Oof!

That, my friends, is the object
of all human attention and devotion.

1258
01:17:50,667 --> 01:17:53,269
- And they call it a TV.
- Wicked cool!

1259
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:56,605
Humans feel an inner need to
connect with the world around them.

1260
01:17:56,606 --> 01:17:58,073
That is super-duper.

1261
01:17:58,074 --> 01:18:00,108
They also feel a need
to sit on their fat butts.

1262
01:18:00,109 --> 01:18:02,478
Watching TV fulfills
both needs at the same time.

1263
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:04,280
Wow. Interesting.

1264
01:18:04,281 --> 01:18:07,149
Come on, kids. Family
time there, in front of the TV.

1265
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:08,351
Got your snack food?

1266
01:18:08,352 --> 01:18:10,018
Buy a vowel.
Buy a vowel!

1267
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:11,954
Buy a "Y". Please buy a "Y".

1268
01:18:11,955 --> 01:18:14,523
- I can't find the remote.
- Hey, Spikey, race ya!

1269
01:18:14,524 --> 01:18:17,092
- Has anybody seen the remote?
- Dad, chill.

1270
01:18:17,093 --> 01:18:18,661
I could do a little TV.

1271
01:18:18,662 --> 01:18:21,264
Today's the day we find out
if the baby is gifted

1272
01:18:21,265 --> 01:18:22,731
or if Saxon is really an alien.

1273
01:18:22,732 --> 01:18:24,633
Like Khan in Star Trek II!

1274
01:18:24,634 --> 01:18:26,635
The Genesis Project was in
the hands of the Enterprise,

1275
01:18:26,636 --> 01:18:29,204
but Khan had his plan
to steal the invention!

1276
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:30,639
Well, that was specific.

1277
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,675
I saw it on TNT,
a retrospective.

1278
01:18:32,676 --> 01:18:35,244
- Gummi Worm, anybody?
- Let me have one.

1279
01:18:35,245 --> 01:18:36,979
Bucky, pass this to Lou.

1280
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:39,415
- Taste this.
- Don't you take that.

1281
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:41,684
- This is the perfect food.
- Fat-free cookies?

1282
01:18:41,685 --> 01:18:43,686
Might as well be eating dirt.

1283
01:18:43,687 --> 01:18:46,389
I've had dirt. I don't like dirt.
It tastes like dirt.

1284
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:49,358
