1
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,370
Wake up, my beauties.

2
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,500
Rise and shine.

3
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,710
It's a brand-new day,
and the mortal world

4
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,650
is at peace.

5
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,180
But not for long.

6
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,320
Just look at them.

7
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,290
I pull one tiny thread,

8
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,780
and their whole world unravels
into chaos.

9
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,820
Glorious chaos.

10
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:17,460
And what could be more
perfect than this?

11
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,440
A noble prince,

12
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,440
a priceless treasure,

13
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,170
and a black-hearted thief.

14
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,880
Oh, this is going to be fun.

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,180
- Cetus?

16
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,250
You know what to do.

17
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,320
Let the games begin.

18
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,570
Gentlemen, this is
what we've been waiting for.

19
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,970
The world's most valuable object

20
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,980
is on its way to Syracuse.

21
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,410
It's a shame
it'll never get there.

22
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,040
After today, we retire to Fiji.

23
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,610
- Fiji!
- Fiji!

24
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,080
Kale!

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,150
Aye, Captain.

26
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,660
- Spike!

27
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,890
Let's get rich!

28
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,230
Did you catch
that last move?

29
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,070
Pretty cool, huh?

30
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,570
I thought you
overworked it.

31
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,770
Just a bit.

32
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,540
Aw, y...

33
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,770
Overworked it?

34
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,480
Oh, and I was overworking it?

35
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,150
Proteus.

36
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,350
Whoa.

37
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,320
This just got interesting.

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,050
How long has it been?

39
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,920
About a lifetime ago.

40
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,800
You still fight
like an old lady.

41
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,830
Sinbad?

42
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,570
- Oh. Ooh.

43
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,870
Sinbad.

44
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,000
What...?
What are you doing here?

45
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,740
I'm working.

46
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,870
You?

47
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,110
What happened to you?

48
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,340
Where have you been?

49
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,410
Hey, love to stop and catch up,

50
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,110
but I've got things to do,
places to go, stuff to steal.

51
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,400
Oh... yeah.

52
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,200
Sinbad,
we need to talk.

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,210
Heard about it,
read about it,

54
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,770
never actually seen it.

55
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,840
The Book of Peace.

56
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,980
It's my job to bring it
safely to Syracuse.

57
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,350
Really? Now, see, now,
I-I just feel bad,

58
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,480
because you're going
to get fired.

59
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,010
You can't be serious.

60
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,620
You disappear for ten years,
show up, and rob me?

61
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,790
I wish it wasn't you.

62
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,920
I do.

63
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,990
Really.

64
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,800
- But...
- But it is me, Sinbad.

65
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,330
Proteus, we had a special
handshake, some code words,

66
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,570
a secret hideout.

67
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,440
It was fun, big fun,
but, uh, we were kids.

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,770
We were friends!

69
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,400
You're not going
to steal this.

70
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,000
Not from me.

71
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,380
And what would you
do with it anyway?

72
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,250
The Book of Peace protects
all of us in the Twelve Cities.

73
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,250
Exactly.

74
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,910
So, just imagine
how much all of us

75
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,120
will pay to get it back.

76
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,350
Let me say it again.

77
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,660
A long time ago,
you and I were friends.

78
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,650
If that ever meant anything
to you, prove it now.

79
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,100
You're right.

80
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,860
That was a long time ago.

81
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,270
Come on.
Don't get all heroic, Proteus.

82
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,880
If you want the Book,
you have to go through me.

83
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,550
What the...?

84
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,460
Dear gods.

85
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,820
Go, Spike.

86
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,960
- I gotcha! I gotcha!

87
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,960
Well, I see you're busy.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,520
So, uh, stay in touch.

89
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,690
Wait! Wait!

90
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,200
You're just going
to run away?

91
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,200
Uh, yeah.

92
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,600
Wh-whoa!

93
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,040
Sinbad!

94
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,350
You! My...!

95
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,650
My ship!

96
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,560
Heads up!

97
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,170
Now...
stand by for sushi.

98
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,720
Give that guy a raise.

99
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,860
Come on!
Come on, Sinbad!

100
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,960
Let's go!

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,060
Wait.
Stand your ground.

102
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,400
- W-What are you doing?

103
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,630
Hey!

104
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,640
Hey, hey!

105
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,800
Lobster Boy, over here!

106
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,110
Run!

107
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,780
Fall back!

108
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,220
Grab hold!

109
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,320
Let's go!

110
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,590
Come on!

111
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:51,830
And the plan?

112
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,130
How about try not to get killed?

113
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,760
Hold on!

114
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,330
Here, you'll need this.

115
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,240
Where are you going?

116
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,440
Fishing!

117
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,820
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right.

118
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,130
Now!

119
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,970
Whoo!

120
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,280
Woo-hoo!

121
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,150
- Oh...
- You okay?

122
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,120
Yeah.

123
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,090
Thanks for sticking around.

124
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,620
Ah, just like old times.

125
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,760
Look out!

126
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,660
- Sinbad!

127
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,620
The day began with such promise.

128
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,730
And now look.

129
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,530
My sea monster is dead,

130
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,940
and I still don't have
the Book of Peace.

131
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,410
All because of you, Sinbad.

132
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,470
Uh-huh.

133
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,140
And you are?

134
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,150
Eris, the Goddess of Discord.

135
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,450
No doubt you've seen
my likeness

136
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,280
on the temple walls.

137
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,720
You know,
they don't do you justice.

138
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,730
Uh-huh. Now...

139
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,490
about my sea monster.

140
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,000
Right, right.

141
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,760
Listen, I'm sorry
about that.

142
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,700
I don't suppose a heartfelt
apology would do.

143
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,030
Heartfelt? From you?

144
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,270
Sinbad, you don't have a heart.

145
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,410
That's what I like about you.

146
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,680
So, I'm going
to let you live.

147
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,380
But there's
just one little thing

148
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,010
you have to do.

149
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,420
Get the Book of Peace
and bring it to me.

150
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,480
Right. Hmm.

151
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,750
Now, see, that's
a problem for me

152
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,590
because I had
my own plans for it.

153
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,600
Uh, ransom, get rich.

154
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,600
You know, "me" stuff.

155
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,430
You're not thinking
big enough, Sinbad.

156
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,870
Steal the Book for ransom,

157
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,370
and you'll be
rich enough

158
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,170
to lounge
on an island beach.

159
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,610
Steal the Book for me,
and you can buy the beach,

160
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,240
and the island and the world.

161
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,340
Hmm.

162
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,350
You let me live,
you make me rich,

163
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,550
I retire to paradise.

164
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,390
So far, I don't see a downside.

165
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,360
If you keep your word.

166
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,330
Sinbad, when a goddess
gives her word,

167
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,630
she's bound for all eternity.

168
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,600
All right, you're on.

169
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,730
I knew you'd
see it my way.

170
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,360
So, when you've
stolen the Book,

171
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,860
follow that star
beyond the horizon.

172
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,500
You'll find yourself

173
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,310
in Tartarus,
my Realm of Chaos.

174
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,510
Tartarus.

175
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,180
I'll see you there.

176
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,810
It's a date then.

177
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,380
So, where were we?

178
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,980
Oh, yes.

179
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,220
You were holding your breath.

180
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,790
He's so cute.

181
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,000
And so gullible.

182
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,940
Cetus, well done.

183
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,280
- Sinbad, you're alive!

184
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,080
Glad you made it.

185
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,820
Pay up.
He lived.

186
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,290
What happened down there?

187
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,520
You wouldn't...

188
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,690
believe me if I told you.

189
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,060
Try me.

190
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,860
All right, here goes.

191
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,700
So I meet Eris,
the Goddess of Chaos.

192
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,290
She's got
a major crush on me,

193
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,300
and she invited me
back to her place.

194
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,700
Ha! That's a good one!

195
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,510
- Goddess of Chaos?

196
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,010
Oh, I'm writing that down.

197
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,980
So, that's it then?
No Book.

198
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,540
Now what do we do?

199
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,880
A little patience, Rat.

200
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,680
It's not like we don't know
where it's going.

201
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,850
Men, all sails to Syracuse!

202
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,760
Right away, sir!

203
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,430
For as long
as I can remember,

204
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,160
I've dreamed of this moment.

205
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,260
The sacred treasure

206
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,860
that's protected us
for a thousand years

207
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,000
is now in Syracuse.

208
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,770
- A toast!
- To Dymas!

209
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,540
Hear, hear!

210
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,910
To the Book of Peace!

211
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,210
And to you, King Dymas
and Prince Proteus.

212
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,310
- Make way!

213
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,320
You see?

214
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,880
This is what happens
when you use the front entrance.

215
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,190
Mm-hmm.

216
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,780
What is he doing here?

217
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,190
At least he's not out
robbing someone.

218
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,390
That's because everyone
worth robbing is here.

219
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,430
I'll bet you ten crowns

220
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,270
you're about to put
those swords down.

221
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,770
I'll take that bet.

222
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,800
Guards...

223
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,370
put away your swords.

224
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,610
I don't see you for ten years,

225
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,340
and now twice in one day...

226
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,780
You're smothering me.

227
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,450
I knew you'd want to thank me
for saving your life... again.

228
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,650
You probably just heard
we had free food and wine.

229
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,660
You hear that, guys?

230
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,920
Dinner and drinks
are on the prince.

231
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,120
Come on.

232
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,860
There's someone
I want you to meet.

233
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,390
Get to work.

234
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,690
Weapons?

235
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,940
Here she is.

236
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,250
I've told her
all about you.

237
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,520
Sinbad, I would
like to introduce you

238
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,850
to my fiancee,

239
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,490
the Lady Marina,
Ambassador from Thrace.

240
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,330
So, this is the infamous Sinbad.

241
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,390
I heard all about this morning.

242
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,340
First you tried to rob Proteus,
and then you save his life.

243
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,530
So, which are you...

244
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,870
a thief or a hero?

245
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,000
Sinbad wanted

246
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,140
to give me an opportunity
to thank...

247
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,120
...him.

248
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,650
Eight months on the sea

249
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,220
with nothing but eggs
and pickles...

250
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,020
you don't know what
that can do to a man.

251
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,530
Oh, it's almost too easy.

252
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,560
There's only
a handful of guards.

253
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,570
Forget it.

254
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,860
Let's get back to the ship.

255
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,030
Just like that?

256
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,940
But the Book is almost ours.

257
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,280
Oh.

258
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,040
Wh-What?
Who is she?

259
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,600
An old girlfriend?

260
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,480
I'm afraid it's
not that simple.

261
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,350
Let's go.

262
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,850
Jed, pack it up.

263
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,150
What? I-I... I just put the...

264
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,360
Oh, this is just too easy.

265
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,400
Look at it this way:

266
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,600
Now that Sinbad's gone,

267
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,040
your father can finally relax
and enjoy the evening.

268
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,700
Well, you're right about that.

269
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,110
He's trying not to show it,

270
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,080
but he's so proud
to have the Book in Syracuse.

271
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,480
He's been planning this day
his whole life.

272
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,180
And soon it will be
your responsibility.

273
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,280
Our responsibility.

274
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,720
It's beautiful.

275
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,960
It is.

276
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,730
My father spent years
preparing it for the Book.

277
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,500
There are guards
on every level,

278
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,160
and if you look
up to the...

279
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,140
Ah...

280
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,610
You were talking about
the ocean, weren't you?

281
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,880
I only wish I'd
seen more of it.

282
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,440
I used to imagine sailing
far beyond the Twelve Cities,

283
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,150
discovering the world.

284
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,990
Oh, look at it, Proteus.

285
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,790
There's so much wonder.

286
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,300
Marina...

287
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,160
Our marriage was arranged
many years ago.

288
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,300
It's always been expected of us.

289
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,710
But politics is not a reason
to get married.

290
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,710
Uh, and I don't want you
to do this

291
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,370
just because it's your duty.

292
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,110
I'm asking you
for myself now.

293
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,780
Marina...

294
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,380
will you marry me?

295
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,450
Proteus, I...

296
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,820
There you are!

297
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,020
I think the delegates
from Manoli

298
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,150
are trying to give a toast.

299
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,560
Although, I'm not sure.

300
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,890
They're doing something
with their knees.

301
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,520
Marina, I need
an ambassador.

302
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,430
Of course, Sire.

303
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,220
- Huh?

304
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,220
- Who's there?

305
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,130
Huh?

306
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,230
Sinbad!

307
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,170
I love playing pretend.

308
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,620
All the pieces
are coming together.

309
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,120
Proteus, the Book!

310
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,460
Sinbad.

311
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,720
Proteus!

312
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,560
It's about time.

313
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,620
Do you realize
how serious this is?

314
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,890
Do you realize

315
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,760
how many times
I've heard that today?

316
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,730
You've betrayed Syracuse!

317
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,930
Oh... not you, too.

318
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,030
Stealing the Book of Peace,

319
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,660
when you knew how much
it meant to us!

320
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,610
Proteus, here's
the way this works.

321
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,370
First, I actually
commit a crime,

322
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,400
and then you get
to blame me for it!

323
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,410
Then how do
you explain this?

324
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,270
Eris.

325
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,150
What?

326
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,480
Eris... she framed me.

327
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,390
- Sinbad, listen to yourself.
- Trust me, Proteus,

328
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,860
the Book is in Tartarus.

329
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,790
Talk to your father.
Tell him I'm...

330
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,120
This is beyond my father.

331
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,690
The ambassadors are convening
now for your trial.

332
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,060
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

333
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,160
Trial? I didn't do it!

334
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,790
Look, I left the Book
on your ship,

335
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,330
and that's the
last I saw of it.

336
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,460
You were there.

337
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,400
You know the truth.

338
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,500
You know me.

339
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,070
Do I?

340
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,200
I knew a kid.

341
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,010
Who are you now, Sinbad?

342
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,640
Look me in the eye
and tell me.

343
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,780
Did you steal the Book?

344
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,890
No.

345
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,060
We've heard enough of your lies.

346
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,120
Sinbad,

347
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,630
for the last time,
give us the Book.

348
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,600
How many times
do I have to say it?

349
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't have it!

350
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,340
Very well, then.

351
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,770
The Delegation

352
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,570
of the Twelve Cities finds you
guilty of treason,

353
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,170
and we sentence you to die.

354
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,180
Take him away.

355
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,680
Come on!
This is a joke, right?

356
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,550
Are you...
are you people blind?

357
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,550
I didn't do it!

358
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,680
Stop!

359
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,690
I demand the right
of substitution.

360
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,550
Take me in his place.

361
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,520
No!

362
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,560
Sinbad says

363
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,650
that Eris took the Book...

364
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,220
and I believe him.

365
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,260
Let him go to Tartarus
and recover the Book.

366
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,270
What?

367
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,630
What are you doing?

368
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,610
You claim that Eris
stole the Book...

369
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,630
steal it back.

370
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,010
You're good at that.

371
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,410
Hey, look, I will not be
responsible for your life.

372
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,670
You would do
the same for me.

373
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,940
No, I wouldn't.

374
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,850
If Sinbad is allowed to leave

375
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,410
the city, he'll
never come back!

376
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,280
Son, listen to reason.

377
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,950
No, Father, you listen.

378
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,580
Sinbad either stole the Book,
or he's telling the truth

379
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,990
and it's in Tartarus.

380
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,590
Either way,
he's our only hope.

381
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,220
But you can't...

382
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:21,570
Proteus, you realize that
if Sinbad does not return,

383
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,730
you will be put to death
in his place.

384
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,570
I understand.

385
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,110
So be it.

386
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,940
Sinbad has ten days

387
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,040
to return the Book.

388
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,210
Release him.

389
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,840
Oh, and, Sinbad...

390
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,380
don't be late.

391
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,940
Hmm.

392
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,140
So, any idea

393
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,980
how we actually
get to Tartarus?

394
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,040
Tartarus?

395
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,250
Oh, no, no, no, no.

396
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,350
People get killed in Tartarus.

397
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,330
So where are we going?

398
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,320
Fiji.

399
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,390
Fiji? This time of year?

400
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,760
Think of the beaches.

401
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,400
Oh, beautiful,
if you like mosquitoes.

402
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,490
Think of the sun.

403
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,400
It's monsoon season.

404
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,270
Oh, then the women.

405
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,670
They're cannibals, Sinbad.

406
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,770
Exactly.

407
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,210
Come on, Kale.

408
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,740
He's your friend.

409
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,220
Listen to you.
You sound like my mother.

410
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,550
Proteus will be fine.

411
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,810
You're sure of that?

412
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,050
You and I both know

413
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,150
Dymas is not going to let them
execute his only son.

414
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,420
So we're running away?

415
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,790
We're retiring.

416
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,090
We don't need another score.
We've got enough.

417
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,650
Now, set a course for Fiji.

418
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,960
Gentlemen,
we're heading to Fiji!

419
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,630
- Fiji! Fiji!

420
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,670
Kale... Book.

421
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,070
Proteus.

422
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,500
Look at all this.

423
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,710
I can't believe it.

424
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,740
Oh, but this can't be real.

425
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,120
It'd be far too deli...

426
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,750
- Uh-oh.

427
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,790
This is more like it.

428
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,320
Stolen from Venezia.

429
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,300
From Pompeii...

430
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,460
And from a brothel
in Syracuse.

431
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:08,730
Good guess.

432
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,600
What do you think
you're doing here?

433
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,040
I'm here to make sure you
get the Book of Peace.

434
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,170
Or bring back your
dead body if you fail.

435
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,470
Really?

436
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,040
And how are you going
to pull that off?

437
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,600
By whatever means necessary.

438
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,010
Did you bring a crew?

439
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,210
No.

440
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,340
You know how to
get to Tartarus?

441
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,350
Um... no.

442
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,380
Can you navigate
on your own?

443
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,050
Yes!

444
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,420
Well, good!

445
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,190
Then I'll dump your butt
in a rowboat,

446
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,490
and you can paddle
all the way back to Syracuse.

447
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,390
'Cause we're going to Fiji.

448
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,030
Fiji?

449
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,090
Yup.

450
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,130
Just as I thought.

451
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,500
What?

452
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,660
Sinbad,

453
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,700
you're not
a very complicated guy.

454
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,800
All someone has to do

455
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,940
is imagine the most
gutless course of action,

456
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,340
and you're bound to take it.

457
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,710
Hey, this is not my problem.

458
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,840
I did not steal the Book.

459
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,180
You're really not going to lose
any sleep over this, are you?

460
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,190
Not a wink.

461
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,520
Because me,
I'd be tossing and turning,

462
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,690
knowing I'm alive...
because I let my friend die.

463
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,790
I'm not responsible
for this mess.

464
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,920
And I didn't ask Proteus

465
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,190
to put his neck
on the line for me.

466
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,470
Look, clearly I can't
appeal to your <i>honor.</i>

467
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,370
But I have other ways
of convincing you.

468
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,240
Really?

469
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,210
Uh... just how do you
expect to do that?

470
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,340
By speaking your language.

471
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,140
Keep talking.

472
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,990
Yup, this'll do!

473
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,820
But not for first class.

474
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,200
As you can see, we're
well equipped to accommodate

475
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,790
the most discerning
of royal tastes.

476
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,240
We have excellent ocean views...

477
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,440
...luxurious living quarters,

478
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,570
with three
gourmet meals a day...

479
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,700
pickles, eggs, and pickles.

480
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,110
Oh, hey, Spike,
there you are.

481
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,520
I'd like to introduce you

482
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,580
to your new bunkmate...
well, actually,

483
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,980
you're his new bunkmate,

484
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,580
as it's actually his bunk.

485
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,750
We do hope

486
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,190
you have a pleasant stay
aboard the <i>Chimera.</i>

487
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,420
Oh, if he starts
hugging your leg,

488
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,020
it means he likes you.

489
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,470
If you think...

490
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,570
How did she even get
on the ship?

491
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,140
Gentlemen, we have a new course.

492
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,380
We're going to Tartarus.

493
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,150
Huh? What
happened to Fiji?

494
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,170
What? No fun?

495
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,210
No beaches?

496
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,050
Rat.

497
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,610
Sorry, Captain.

498
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,920
But did you
say Tartarus?

499
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,930
That's right.

500
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,760
Will that be
the same Tartarus

501
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,860
from which no sailor
ever returns?

502
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,830
The Tartarus
of lost souls,

503
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,130
where they
grind your bones

504
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,600
and pickle your
spleen, and...

505
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,330
No, Rat.
This is the nice Tartarus,

506
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,860
with lots of beaches and drinks.

507
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,140
You know,
with little umbrellas?

508
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,840
<i>Non ci posso credere,</i>

509
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,370
<i>non ci posso credere,</i>
<i>mi hanno fregato ancora.</i>

510
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,480
I'm only doing this
for the money.

511
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,280
Right.

512
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,080
So how do we get there?

513
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,390
That star's our point.

514
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,670
Wow.

515
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,010
Our little thief
isn't going to run away.

516
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,840
He thinks he's going to pay us
a visit.

517
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,350
Hmm. Let's provide
some mood music.

518
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,700
Oh, come on. You look great.

519
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,710
Look lively!
Jed, get the long poles!

520
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,410
Oh, pardon me, milady.

521
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,010
Hey, we need
a pole over here.

522
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,110
Jin, one over here.

523
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,850
Yeah, come on, come on, come on.

524
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,260
The Dragon's Teeth?

525
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,060
Indeed, signorina.

526
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,690
Only the most
foolish of captains

527
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,700
would dare to sail
a ship through this!

528
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,540
Rat, reef the fores'le.

529
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,370
Oh, ex-excuse me, signorina.

530
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,140
Are you sure
you know what...?

531
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,670
Yes, we've done this
kind of thing before.

532
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,050
- No, there is no other way.
- Look...

533
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,180
- And, yes,
- But...

534
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,520
you have my permission
to stand there quietly

535
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,220
and get a free lesson
in sailing.

536
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,220
You know...

537
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,750
Besides, a ship is
no place for a woman.

538
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,760
Jin!

539
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,760
Easy on the main!

540
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,760
Aye!

541
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,120
Steady as she goes.

542
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,920
Rocks off the starboard bow!

543
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,080
Steady.

544
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,260
What is that sound?

545
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,890
Shh.

546
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,940
Sinbad, I...

547
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,710
Sirens.

548
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,350
Sinbad.

549
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,630
Sinbad!

550
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,640
Jin?

551
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,260
- Li?

552
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,600
Come and get it, ladies!

553
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,970
Kale?

554
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,340
Come with me.

555
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,470
We'll speak of love.

556
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,610
Oh...

557
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,550
Who's bad?

558
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,110
Sin-bad.

559
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,210
Ah... men.

560
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,060
I saw her first!

561
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,870
Round the deck! Now!

562
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,410
Yeah...

563
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,650
Amore!

564
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,340
Amore! Amore!

565
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,350
My darling.

566
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,250
Rat!

567
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,280
I love you.

568
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,190
Il mare e le onde andiamo via.

569
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,810
Spike!

570
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,810
Get Sinbad!

571
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,510
Ow!

572
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,520
Spike, the blades!

573
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,460
Oh, my precious.

574
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,990
Wake up, you idiot!

575
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,600
What happened?

576
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,040
Sinbad saved us.

577
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,300
No, Marina.

578
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,870
Marina saved us? Marina!

579
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,040
Marina saved us.

580
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,510
All right, men, snap out of it.

581
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,910
Let's get back to reality.

582
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,140
We got a ship to sail.

583
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,050
Here's my little hero.

584
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,590
You were so brave.

585
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,950
Yeah. What a good dog.

586
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,820
Uh...

587
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,260
Uh...

588
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,420
Still think a ship's
no place for a woman?

589
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,360
Absolutely!

590
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,390
I mean, look at my ship!

591
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,930
This railing was
hand-carved mahogany!

592
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,060
And here!

593
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,440
These moldings came
all the way from Damascus!

594
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,670
Do you have any idea

595
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,840
what I went through
to steal these?

596
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,610
That's exactly
why women shouldn't drive.

597
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,380
Are you crazy?

598
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,290
I saved your life!

599
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,760
Oh, I would've been fine.

600
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,730
I always am.

601
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,320
Right.

602
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,260
So ungrateful.

603
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,730
It's just typical.

604
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,460
And you chipped the paint!

605
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,730
Right here...
look at it.

606
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,360
That's more than
a little scratch.

607
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,990
The dog and the crew
and th-th-that woman!

608
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,300
What?!

609
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,140
- Thank you!
- You're welcome!

610
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,830
- No problem!
- Don't worry about it!

611
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,000
- I won't!
- Good!

612
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,410
- Good-bye!
- Bye to you!

613
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,820
You happy now?

614
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:00,300
Proteus, come quickly.

615
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,310
What? Wh...?

616
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,820
There's a ship
waiting in the harbor.

617
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,180
A crew of my most
trusted officers

618
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,510
will take you
far from Syracuse.

619
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,420
But the ambassadors' guards?

620
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,350
Are asleep or well-bribed.

621
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,820
But we must go now.

622
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,950
Go where?

623
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,390
To live the rest of my life
in exile?

624
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,660
To live, son.

625
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,600
I won't let them execute
you for Sinbad's crime.

626
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,860
Neither will Sinbad.

627
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,530
Proteus, don't be foolish!

628
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,940
Sinbad has no intention
of going to Tartarus.

629
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,910
The Sinbad you knew
as a child is...

630
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,200
Is still in him as a man.

631
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,040
I've seen it.

632
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,240
Proteus...

633
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,440
Go, Father.

634
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,150
I know what I'm doing.

635
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,200
All right, listen up.

636
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,500
We're here for ten minutes.

637
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,300
You get lost, you get left.

638
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,350
How did one woman
do so much damage?

639
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,820
All right, I'm going to need
the full set of chisels,

640
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,840
the jack plane,
and about a cord of cut wood.

641
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,650
All right, men, you
heard the captain.

642
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,020
Find some logs
and be quick about it.

643
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,030
- Oh, for heaven's sake!

644
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,620
You only need
a little tree sap,

645
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,100
and she'll be
as good as new.

646
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,860
When I want
your advice, I'll...

647
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,990
Hey, hey, hey!

648
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,160
Where do you think
you're going?

649
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,030
Well, fine!
At least take someone with y...

650
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,260
May I assist you, lady?

651
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,900
- Why, thank you.

652
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,200
- Right this way, signorina.
- How nice to see

653
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,970
some men haven't forgotten
a little common courtesy.

654
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,600
...common courtesy.

655
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,870
Not so fast.

656
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,010
But you know she's right.

657
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,710
The tree sap would
be perfect for...

658
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,010
Just...

659
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,520
stay with the ship.

660
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,190
I already said thank you.

661
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,560
That's what this is all about,
isn't it?

662
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,290
It's about repairing the ship.

663
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,300
If I break something,
I fix it.

664
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,060
Um, knife, please.

665
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,970
Oh, yeah,
like I'd give you a weapon?

666
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,000
Thank you, Rat.

667
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,240
You know, you really
ought to be

668
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,010
a little more courteous.

669
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,870
Oh, great.

670
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,680
Now I'm getting
etiquette lessons

671
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,310
from a bilge rat.

672
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,280
Well, she did save
the ship, Captain.

673
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,840
Why, thank you, Luca.

674
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,790
And now she's helping to fix it.

675
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,090
Very handy, I say.

676
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,420
And brave!

677
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,430
This... girl wouldn't know how
to fix a broken fingernail!

678
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,330
Honestly, you are
the most boorish,

679
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,530
pig-headed man
I've ever met.

680
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,540
Hey, lady, I've seen
the highborn boys

681
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,500
your type hangs out with...

682
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,630
...and I'm the only man
you've ever met.

683
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,340
- Whoa.

684
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,350
- Mmm.

685
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:53,480
Oh, no. No. No.

686
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,950
No...

687
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,720
Five on Marina.

688
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,450
You... you...

689
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,190
egotistical...

690
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,760
- You spoiled...
- disrespectful,

691
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,630
- deluded,
- pretentious, pompous,

692
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:11,100
- high-and-mighty...
- self-centered, untrustworthy,

693
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,040
ungrateful, impossible,
insufferable...

694
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,540
At least I'm not repressed!

695
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,770
Repressed?!

696
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,640
I'll show you
repressed!

697
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,310
What the...?

698
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,990
Put it back.

699
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,270
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa...

700
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,780
- Ew...

701
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,240
Ew!

702
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,620
Run!

703
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,620
- It's a fish!
- It's a fish!

704
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,720
Kale!

705
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,020
Kale!

706
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,690
- Whoa!

707
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,940
- Jump!

708
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,280
Kale!

709
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,280
Got it!

710
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,150
Veer off, Kale!

711
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,460
The star!

712
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,860
Hold your heading!

713
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,330
Rat, tie it off!

714
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,990
Wha... wha...

715
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,070
Ha-ha!

716
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,160
Wait!

717
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,250
Yee-ha!

718
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,810
Sinbad!

719
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,940
The men can't take much more.

720
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,610
I can't...

721
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,150
take much more, either.

722
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,920
Cut the line!

723
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,770
- Oh, no, Spike!

724
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,710
- Whoa, hold on, no...
- No, no, no, please...

725
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,730
- Oh, Spike!

726
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,770
Hey, where'd he get
the carrots?

727
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,420
Whose idea was that again?

728
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,290
I don't know.

729
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,060
But he owes me lunch.

730
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,030
The Granite Gates.

731
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,330
Bet you never thought
I'd get us this far.

732
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,570
No, I didn't.

733
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,870
But Proteus did.

734
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:37,170
For some reason,
he trusts you.

735
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:42,240
Well, what could
he have been thinking?

736
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,750
How did you
two ever meet?

737
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,980
Running for my
life, as usual.

738
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,180
A couple of angry thugs
had cornered me

739
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,750
outside the palace walls.

740
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,060
I was trapped.

741
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,690
A sword at my throat,

742
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,460
at my chest, at my...

743
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,130
- Pickles and eggs!

744
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,430
Well, you get the idea.

745
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,410
And then suddenly,
there was a fourth blade.

746
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,600
It was Proteus.

747
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:12,110
You see, he'd watched it all
from his room in the palace.

748
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,270
He actually climbed down

749
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,440
the castle wall
to fight at my side,

750
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,070
and, boy, did we fight.

751
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,780
It was like we'd rehearsed it.

752
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,810
We were best friends
from that day forward.

753
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,850
What happened with you two?

754
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,530
What is it?

755
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:37,560
We... took different paths.

756
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,310
Enough talking.

757
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:54,620
Time for some screaming.

758
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:16,610
For crying out loud,
what next?

759
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,340
Oh, get a shirt on

760
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,710
before you poke
someone's eye out.

761
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,320
Okay, guys, get down there
and break it up!

762
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,050
We've got to keep moving!

763
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,090
Steal the Book of Peace.

764
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,360
We will retire in the tropics.

765
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,690
Everyone, back on the ship!

766
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:10,920
Hurry!

767
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,660
Come on! Come on! Move faster!

768
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,510
Jed!

769
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,980
Grab the rope!

770
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,330
Rat, your hand!

771
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:44,650
Marina!

772
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,450
<i>Rat! Don't let</i>

773
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,080
- the blocks freeze!
- Aye, aye, Captain.

774
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,810
- And, Kale!
- Aye!

775
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,680
Give me a hug?

776
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,950
Excuse me?

777
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,220
Hmph.

778
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:22,790
Oh, she couldn't see the bird?

779
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:25,350
Everyone else saw it.

780
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:29,130
It's as big as a freakin' ship.

781
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:33,370
Marina?
Marina's looking the other way.

782
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,270
- Shh, shh, shh.

783
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,420
You're rescuing me!

784
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:51,450
Yes, if that's what
you want to call it.

785
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:53,980
But this is going
to cost you another diamond.

786
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:57,520
Rescues aren't part
of the usual tourist package.

787
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,530
So...

788
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,090
how are we going
to get down?

789
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,500
I... I don't know.

790
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,730
- What?!
- I don't know yet.

791
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,600
I'm thinking about it,
all right?

792
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,910
You scaled a thousand-
foot tower of ice,

793
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,840
and you don't know
how to get down?

794
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,470
Of all the ungrateful...

795
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:16,740
Look, if you'd rather
take your chances on your own,

796
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,910
that can be arranged.

797
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,510
Shh-shh-shh-shh.
All right.

798
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:20,880
All right.

799
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,390
So,

800
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,050
what do we have
to work with?

801
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:27,560
Um... ropes?

802
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,390
Uh... no.

803
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,560
Uh, grappling hooks?

804
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,150
Yeah... no.

805
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,360
Your swords?

806
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,360
Hey, I've got this.

807
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,700
Oh, great.

808
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,600
He can pick his teeth
when he's done with us.

809
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,770
Yeah.

810
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:42,740
Okay. See,
in the hands of an expert,

811
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,540
a good knife has 1,001 uses.

812
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,600
- Ooh!

813
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,380
uh...

814
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,320
Run!

815
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,790
Come on! Faster!

816
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,490
W-Wait, wait. What?

817
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:08,760
Let's go!

818
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,770
No...!

819
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:15,700
Oh! Oh!

820
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,810
- Oh!
- Ah!

821
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,820
I think we lost him!

822
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,830
- I don't think so!
- Heads down!

823
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:37,590
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whoa!

824
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:39,930
- Whoa!

825
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,460
- Oh, no!

826
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:55,850
Lean right!

827
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:07,780
- Whew.

828
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,660
- Come on!

829
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,070
- Hang on!

830
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:42,860
Yep, there they are.

831
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:52,830
There...

832
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:55,070
Just as I... planned.

833
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:01,740
It's Marina!

834
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:09,310
We thought you
were gone forever!

835
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:11,960
Oh, I'm fine. Really.

836
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:14,390
But I'm touched by your concern.

837
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,980
Yee-ha!

838
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,480
Sinbad?

839
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,110
Thank you for coming after me.

840
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:15,140
Well, y...

841
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,120
you're welcome.

842
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,260
This life suits you.

843
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,490
Yeah.

844
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,460
I wasn't made for dry land.

845
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,830
And you?

846
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,630
Is it the shore... or the sea?

847
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:35,970
I've always loved the sea.

848
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:39,740
I even dreamed
of a life on it.

849
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,750
But it wasn't meant to be.

850
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:45,110
I have responsibilities
in Syracuse.

851
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,980
You really have to give it up?

852
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,350
Yes.

853
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,620
You know, I've
traveled the world,

854
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:23,380
seen things no other
man has seen...

855
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,620
but nothing...

856
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:29,820
nothing compares
to the open sea.

857
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:32,850
And is this what
you always wanted?

858
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,330
Not really.

859
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:37,060
When we were young,
Proteus and I

860
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,230
used to talk about
joining the Royal Navy

861
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:42,240
and serving Syracuse
side by side.

862
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:46,680
But as we got older,
our lives began to change.

863
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:51,410
He's a prince,
and I'm... well.

864
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,190
I was never jealous
of him, though...

865
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,160
until one morning,
a ship came into harbor...

866
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:03,150
a ship with his
future on it.

867
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,460
It was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen.

868
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,230
What was on the ship?

869
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,800
You.

870
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:17,710
Proteus met you
at the dock.

871
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,640
I jumped on the
first outbound ship

872
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,580
and never looked back.

873
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,540
Until now.

874
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,380
Rat! Give me a lookout!

875
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:22,300
We're dead.

876
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:23,630
What is it?!

877
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:25,360
I-I-It just ends, Captain!

878
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,270
It's the edge of the world!

879
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:31,840
Pay up. It's flat.

880
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:35,180
Well, that's it.
Time to go home.

881
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:36,180
Nuh-uh-uh.

882
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:38,380
The captain hasn't
given his orders yet.

883
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:43,780
Follow that star
beyond the horizon.

884
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:46,550
Beyond the horizon.

885
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,460
Sinbad?

886
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,230
Men! All hands to your posts!

887
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:01,430
Free all sheets!
Wait for my command!

888
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:02,770
What?

889
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,800
Now! Go! Go! Go!

890
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,710
Eh, Sinbad, how-how are
we gonna pull this off?

891
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,040
Just trust me.

892
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,550
Rat! Rig the main yard
to the fors'le!

893
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,070
But that would stop us dead!

894
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:12,780
Just do it!

895
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,380
Aye, aye, Captain.

896
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,090
Whoa!

897
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,560
Slack to all sheets!

898
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:22,060
Aye, aye, Cap'n!

899
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:23,250
Cut the fore and main trusses!

900
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,960
- Move! Move! Move!

901
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,590
I got it. I got it. I got it.

902
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:29,600
Aft yard astern!

903
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:30,600
But that's...

904
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,970
Crazy, I know! Now hurry!

905
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:34,770
Here, grab it!

906
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:36,210
Go!

907
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,430
Swing the fors'le to port!

908
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,270
Ease the aft!
Full hoist to forward sails!

909
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,970
Aye, aye, Captain.

910
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:43,000
Come on!

911
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:44,280
Pull!

912
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,020
Tie off all sails!

913
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,960
All hands amidships!

914
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:57,620
And pray to the gods.

915
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:00,190
We may be meeting them soon.

916
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,340
We're going to die.

917
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:31,990
Hold on! Grab the rope!

918
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,660
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

919
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,090
It worked?

920
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,750
Sinbad...

921
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:03,090
...you did it.

922
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:18,640
- Grab hold!

923
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,870
Grum, hard to port!

924
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,810
Hard to port!

925
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:25,880
- Kale!
- Aye!

926
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,890
If I don't make it,
the ship is yours.

927
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,610
No.

928
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,380
Gentlemen, it's
been a privilege

929
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,010
robbing with you.

930
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:37,380
I'm coming with you.

931
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,690
And don't tell me

932
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:41,630
the Realm of Chaos is
no place for a woman.

933
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:45,300
Hmm.

934
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,670
I would never say that.

935
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:53,700
Hey, sorry, boy.

936
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,110
Not this time.

937
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,720
Huh?

938
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,290
- Huh?
- Huh?

939
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:38,620
Now, now, my pets.

940
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:43,280
Is this any way
to treat a guest?

941
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:54,520
Okay, I'm severely creeped out.

942
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,030
Bravo.

943
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:00,330
No mortal has ever made it
to Tartarus before.

944
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:04,170
Alive, that is...

945
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:06,400
Make yourself at home.

946
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:09,440
Thank you. Uh...

947
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,810
nice place you got here.

948
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:12,210
Like it?

949
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:15,480
I'm planning on doing
the whole world this way.

950
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,880
Wow, that's a good plan.

951
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,760
Well, I see you're busy,
so listen, we'll just take

952
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:24,920
the Book of Peace
and get of your way.

953
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:27,560
What makes you think I have it?

954
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:30,000
Uh, well, you framed me
for the theft,

955
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:31,560
so they would execute me.

956
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,860
You?

957
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:33,890
Yeah.

958
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:38,200
No.

959
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,500
Proteus!

960
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:41,570
You knew he would take my place.

961
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,740
What a clever little man
you are.

962
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,370
You thought I'd run.

963
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:50,180
Then Proteus would die,
and Syracuse would be...

964
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,590
Left without
the next rightful king,

965
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:56,680
and tumble into glorious chaos.

966
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:00,090
You humans are so predictable.

967
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:02,790
Proteus couldn't help
being ever so noble,

968
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:05,130
and you couldn't help
betraying him.

969
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:08,300
But I didn't betray Proteus!
I didn't run away.

970
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,310
Oh, but you did betray him.

971
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,870
You stole his only love.

972
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,100
Look at her, Sinbad.

973
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:17,550
He's not even
in his grave yet,

974
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:20,180
and you're moving in
on his girl.

975
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:25,620
Face it: Your heart
is as black as mine.

976
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:27,450
You're wrong about him!

977
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:28,790
He knows I'm not!

978
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:30,260
You don't know
what's in his heart.

979
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:31,990
Oh, yes, I do.

980
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:34,960
And more importantly,
so does he.

981
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,470
In your heart,
you know that

982
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,400
Proteus is
going to die

983
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,840
because he saw
something in you

984
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:42,930
that just isn't there.

985
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:44,270
No.

986
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:45,610
You want to bet?

987
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,410
I'll tell you what.
Let's play a game.

988
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:50,500
And if you win,
I'll give you

989
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:51,910
the Book of Peace.

990
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:59,180
There it is, noble hero.

991
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:04,020
ERIS:
Not so fast.

992
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,190
My game has rules,
Sinbad.

993
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:08,200
I'll ask you a question.

994
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:10,220
One simple question.

995
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:13,830
If you answer truthfully,
the Book is yours.

996
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:15,900
- Give me your word.

997
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:18,070
You still don't trust me?

998
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:20,410
Uh... no.

999
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:24,540
Isn't it a pity
we live in such skeptical times?

1000
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,070
Oh, all right.

1001
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:29,680
You have my word, as a goddess.

1002
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:32,550
Fair enough?

1003
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,260
Ask your question.

1004
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,350
Excellent.

1005
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,630
Now, we all know what happens

1006
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,890
if you get the Book of Peace.

1007
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:46,200
You return it to Syracuse
and save Proteus.

1008
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,470
But if you don't get the Book,

1009
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,470
you have
a choice to make.

1010
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:52,370
Either sail to paradise

1011
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:54,140
with the woman
of your dreams,

1012
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:57,880
or return to Syracuse to die.

1013
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,680
You're either a thief or a hero.

1014
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,380
So, here's my question, Sinbad.

1015
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,120
If you don't get the Book,

1016
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,150
will you go back to die?

1017
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:25,160
I will go back.

1018
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:38,990
You're lying.

1019
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,230
I'm sorry, Marina.

1020
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:26,000
Eris is right about me.

1021
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,370
No, she's not.
You answered her question.

1022
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:29,530
You told the truth.

1023
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:32,240
It wasn't the truth.

1024
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,640
It was me trying to pass
myself off as someone I'm not.

1025
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,480
Sinbad,
I've seen who you are!

1026
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:39,140
You don't need to pretend!

1027
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:40,410
Eris trapped you!

1028
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:44,080
Why should you or Proteus
or anyone have to die?!

1029
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:44,820
Marina...

1030
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,910
No! You need to escape.

1031
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,190
Get as far away as you can.

1032
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:51,290
I'll go back.
I'll explain everything.

1033
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:52,190
No, Marina.

1034
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,830
I can't watch you die!

1035
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:01,000
I love you.

1036
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:30,430
But could you love a man
who would run away?

1037
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:39,930
I bet you thought
I wouldn't make it.

1038
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:42,460
I was...

1039
01:08:42,510 --> 01:08:45,200
...beginning to wonder.

1040
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:50,940
The Book?

1041
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:54,280
I did my best.

1042
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,220
It wasn't enough.

1043
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:00,790
No.

1044
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:03,050
You came back anyway.

1045
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:08,330
How could I do anything else...
my friend?

1046
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:20,660
Get back!

1047
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:39,290
How dare you?!

1048
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:43,190
Everything
was going perfectly,

1049
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:46,060
and now you do this!

1050
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:52,900
Eris, I don't understand.

1051
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:55,060
Don't play coy with me.

1052
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:58,800
Maybe you can fool these people,

1053
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,610
but I know who you are.

1054
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,880
You're a selfish,
unprincipled liar!

1055
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,540
Wait a minute.

1056
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:08,610
I didn't lie.

1057
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:10,310
I came back.

1058
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,750
That's why you're here.

1059
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:13,920
This was all part
of your test.

1060
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,190
I told the truth.

1061
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,920
And wasn't there something

1062
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,330
about being
"bound for all eternity"?

1063
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:44,120
Well, well, well.

1064
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:47,060
This has got to be a little
embarrassing for you, Eris.

1065
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:50,630
Don't push your luck, Sinbad.

1066
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:54,530
You're cute,
but not that cute.

1067
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,640
And lucky for you,
I've got places to go,

1068
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:04,400
things to destroy,
stuff to steal.

1069
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,970
Ta.

1070
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:58,760
You know,
for what it's worth,

1071
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,660
I think the council
believes you now.

1072
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,400
You think?

1073
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,640
King Dymas.

1074
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,150
Uh, whoa, hey.

1075
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:19,410
How much you got on you?

1076
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:23,610
I offer you the gratitude
of the Twelve Cities,

1077
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:26,590
and the apology of a king.

1078
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:29,060
No, really. How much?

1079
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:31,220
Sinbad.

1080
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:38,930
Come on.

1081
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:40,940
This is going to be
a heck of a party.

1082
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:43,570
Everyone's going to want
to hear about the voyage.

1083
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:45,230
Fair winds, calm seas.

1084
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:47,470
Nothing much to tell.

1085
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:50,170
What's the matter?

1086
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:52,440
No fun if you're
actually invited?

1087
01:13:57,550 --> 01:13:59,650
No, it's just, uh...

1088
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:02,180
there's a hammock in Fiji
with my name on it.

1089
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,730
Good sailing, Sinbad.

1090
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:13,570
Get a haircut.

1091
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,370
You're going to be king someday.

1092
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,570
Just another

1093
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:55,910
uneventful day in Syracuse.

1094
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:04,650
You know, I stood here
with a woman once.

1095
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:06,620
She looked over the ocean

1096
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:09,320
and wished she could sail
beyond the horizon.

1097
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,800
She saw... such wonder.

1098
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:16,660
And what happened
to this woman?

1099
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,760
She got her chance.

1100
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,260
She sailed the seas,
and she fell in love.

1101
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:28,570
Proteus, I...

1102
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:32,340
Marina, follow your heart.

1103
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:35,250
Mine is here in Syracuse.

1104
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:36,880
Yours...

1105
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:41,120
yours is sailing
with the next tide.

1106
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:46,720
Oh, Proteus.

1107
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:05,910
Captain?

1108
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:07,140
Hmm?

1109
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,240
We're ready to sail.

1110
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:11,380
All right, Kale.

1111
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:13,620
Take us out.

1112
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:15,120
Aye, aye, Captain.

1113
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:16,750
Cast off!

1114
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,210
Oh... Rat!

1115
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,240
What?

1116
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:47,580
Excuse me, Captain.

1117
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:50,420
You need to replace
these rig joints pretty soon.

1118
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:52,460
The mizzen ropes
need the support.

1119
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:57,590
These joints
were from the Jasmine Sea.

1120
01:16:57,630 --> 01:16:59,970
That's halfway around the world.

1121
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,130
Then we'd better get started.

1122
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,440
Well, you know,

1123
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:10,340
that means going through
the Hydra's lair.

1124
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,250
- Mm-hmm.
- The Minotaur's haven.

1125
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,440
- Mm-hmm.
- The Cyclops' den.

1126
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,110
- Mm-hmm.
- Under the Swansea Bridge.

1127
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:17,120
- Mm-hmm.
- Through the China Seas.

1128
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:18,950
That's a very long voyage.

1129
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:23,390
And it's very, very dangerous.

1130
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:24,720
Don't worry.

1131
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,060
I'll protect you.

1132
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:44,810
Oh, Spike.

1133
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:46,650
Spike.

1134
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,450
Spike... down.
