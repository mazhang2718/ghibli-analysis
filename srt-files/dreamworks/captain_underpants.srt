That's perfect. Okay.</i>

12
00:01:23,255 --> 00:01:25,383
<i>Underpantyworld was</i>
a <i>peaceful planet</i>

Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Da-da.

<i>Big Daddy Longiohns and his wife,

<i>by stretching his underwear
really far...</i>

20

21
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:43,939

26
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:52,656
<i>Dolphins?</i>

27
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:54,505
<i>Yeah, dolphins.
Just go with it.</i>

28
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:55,781
Okay, fine.

29
00:01:55,935 --> 00:01:57,311
Goo-goo, gah-gah.

30
00:01:57,335 --> 00:01:59,178
Tra-la-la-la-la-Ia.

31

<i>But the space
baby grew up fast.</i>

32
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:07,024
Look! Up in the sky!

33
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:08,700
It's a bird!
It's a plane!

34
00:02:08,855 --> 00:02:11,096
It's an egg salad sandwich.

35
00:02:11,255 --> 00:02:13,383
And guess what? I'm rotten.

36
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,706
Faster than
a speeding waistband.

37
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:18,856
More powerful

38
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:20,659
- than boxer shorts.
- Yay!

39
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,626
You'll never catch me,
Captain Underpants.

40
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:25,504
Owie.

41
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:29,057
Able to leap tall buildings
without getting a wedgie.

42
00:02:30,055 --> 00:02:31,784
Hey, all right.
Good for you, pal.

43
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:33,898
Now put on some clothes,
you weirdo.

44
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:36,296
No way.

45
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:38,544
I fight for truth, justice,

46
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:40,856
and all that is
pre-shrunk and cottony.

47
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:42,460
For I am...

48
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:45,897
Captain Underpants!

49
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:48,986
The origin issue.

50
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,059
It's so good. We should've
done an origin issue ages ago.

51
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,899
Yeah, like, first.

52
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:55,711
You know, I'm not sure
about the dolphins, though.

53
00:02:55,735 --> 00:02:56,896
Yeah, I know. It's just...

54
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:58,111
I didn't know if it was
the thing where it's,

55
00:02:58,135 --> 00:02:59,660
like, good weird or bad weird.

56
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:01,535
Like, is it something...

57
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:02,986
The origin issue!

58
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:04,939
I've told you two
a thousand times

59
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:06,739
not to draw
these idiotic comics!

60
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,896
Freeze!

61
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:10,257
Hey, everybody!
Wait one second.

62
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:11,655
Hi. I'm George Beard.

63
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:13,231
And this is my best friend,
Harold Hutchins.

64
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:14,745
Hey. Ah, man.

65
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:16,585
It's okay.
We got more ideas.

66
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:19,176
See, Harold loves to draw
and I love to tell stories.

67
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:21,178
And this old guy looking angry
right here...

68
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,417
well, this is the worst
principal in the world...

69
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:24,616
Mr. Krupp.

70
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:26,584
Mean old Mr. Krupp.

71
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:28,385
Hates anything fun.

72
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,020
Like comic books...

73
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:31,176
recess...

74
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:34,856
Christmas.

75
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,221
Ho, ho, whoa!

76
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:38,296
Even kittens!

77
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:42,299
Oh, my goodness.
Did that really happen?

78
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,298
Uh, no, not technically.

79
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:45,945
But it might <i>as</i> well have!

80
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:48,737
I'm sorry.
I'm still mad about the comic.

81
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,135
Yeah, me too.

82
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:51,701
And unfreeze.

83
00:03:51,855 --> 00:03:54,096
In my office, now!

84
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:08,425
What is happening right now?

85
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,980
I don't know.

86
00:04:10,855 --> 00:04:13,015
Do you think he fell
asleep with his eyes open?

87
00:04:13,055 --> 00:04:15,501
Maybe. Let's try and leave
and see what happens.

88
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:25,303
Door lock activated.

89
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:27,617
Wow. That's an expensive door.

90
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,460
It was a choice between the magnetic
automatic door closer...

91
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:32,936
and the music and arts programs.

92
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:38,415
Pretty sure
I made the right choice.

93
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,499
This morning's school sign
is supposed to read...

94
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:45,420
"Sewage plant field trips
are today."

95
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:49,257
So can either of you explain
why it now reads...

96
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:52,180
"Come see my hairy armpits?"

97
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:55,700
I know you two are responsible.

98
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:56,949
How? How do you know?

99
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:57,831
Do you have any proof?

100
00:04:57,855 --> 00:04:59,175
I mean,
this is a country of laws.

101
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:00,302
The proof is here.

102
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:01,536
Inside my gut.

103
00:05:01,695 --> 00:05:03,538
He must have
a lot of proof in there.

104
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:05,699
Quiet fives.
Quiet fives.

105
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:06,776
Hmm.

106
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:09,142
Ever since you attended
this elementary school...

107
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:12,378
you've been responsible
for one prank after another.

108
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:15,299
Shh...

109
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:38,741
Wow, that's a lot of pranks.

110
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:40,579
Yeah, when it's cut
all together like that,

111
00:05:40,655 --> 00:05:42,066
you really get a sense
of the scope.

112
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:44,031
Some of those must've been
really hard to pull off.

113
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:45,864
And dangerous.
Like that tiger'

114
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:47,255
Oh, that tiger was crazy.

115
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:49,417
For four long years...

116
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:50,631
you two have been disrupting

117
00:05:50,655 --> 00:05:53,864
the carefully calibrated,
drone-like beehive...

118
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:56,865
that this elementary school
is supposed to be.

119
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:59,743
I may not be able
to prove it yet...

120
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,336
but I'm gonna get you two
one day.

121
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,942
One day very, very soon.

122
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:08,099
All right.
Fair enough.

123
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:11,259
Get out of my office. Now!

124
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:16,066
You see what we're up against?

125
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:18,946
And that's just a typical day
at Jerome Horwitz Elementary.

126
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:21,786
More like
Jerome Horwitz Penitentiary.

127
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:26,261
<i>Hey, guys-</i>

128
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:27,462
What's going on, Tommy?

129
00:06:27,615 --> 00:06:29,299
Same old, same old.

130
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:32,424
Poor kid.

131
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:34,464
Time to have fun with history.

132
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:36,617
Memorize these dates.

133
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:42,544
1827,1853,1914,1926.

134
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:44,618
First graders.
Always hits them the hardest.

135
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:46,305
Hold on a sec.

136
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:48,943
So that's why we do what we do.

137
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:50,984
He's left us no choice.

138
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,546
Our pranks and practical jokes

139
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:54,225
are the last line of defense...

140
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,981
against the injustice
of our terrible principal.

141
00:06:57,135 --> 00:06:58,660
Well, well, well.

142
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:00,216
I heard you both got into

143
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,820
a bit of the old trouble today.

144
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:03,095
How'd you hear that, Melvin?

145
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,819
Did you tattle-tale on us?

146
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:07,977
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

147
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,575
<i>I did.</i>

148
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,260
Someone has to
stand up for the Man.

149
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:15,497
No one has to
stand up for the Man.

150
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:17,100
That's the whole point
of the Man.

151
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:18,825
He stands up
for himself, Melvin.

152
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:20,346
Respectfully disagree.

153
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,831
Attention, everyone.

154
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:29,991
Principal <i>Krupp</i> here

155
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:31,096
<i>with an announcement.</i>

156
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:35,180
<i>This Saturday ts the mandatory
Invention Convention.</i>

157
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:36,461
Boo!
Oh, what?

158
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:37,576
Yes!

159
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:39,305
That's our third Saturday
this month!

160
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:42,783
<i>You must he here with
your inventions at 8:00 am.</i>

161
00:07:43,135 --> 00:07:44,335
Is there no justice?

162
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,662
<i>I know that's early
for Saturday, but don't worry.</i>

163
00:07:46,815 --> 00:07:47,975
<i>You should be done by 9:00...</i>

164
00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:49,016

165
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,376
Tree house?

166
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:00,536
Tree house.

167
00:08:29,055 --> 00:08:30,898
Welcome to
the world headquarters

168
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,898
of Tree House Comix, Inc.

169
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:37,740
Yep. This is
where the magic happens.

170
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:39,181
Not, like, actual magic.

171
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:42,100
No, we're not
practicing the dark arts.

172
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:44,981
No, here we just hang out
and make comics

173
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:46,426
and try to
make each other laugh.

174
00:08:47,055 --> 00:08:48,739
That's how we became friends.

175
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,066
This is me in kindygarten.

176
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:52,741
And this is me.

177
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:54,226
George and I aren't friends yet.

178
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,376
But we're about to be.

179
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,335
The seventh planet
from the sun is called...

180
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:01,540
Uranus.

181
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:08,382
Scientists refer to Uranus...

182
00:09:08,535 --> 00:09:10,025
Your anus.

183
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,431
As one of the planets...

184
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:12,945
I know.

185
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:20,136
Known as a gas giant.

186
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:24,702
I don't get it.
It's just science, guys.

187
00:09:24,975 --> 00:09:26,306
As I was saying...

188
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:27,536
Hey, I'm George. You wanna

189
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:28,951
hang out in my tree house
after school?

190
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:30,261
You have a tree house?

191
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:37,299
Ever since then, we've created
hundreds of comics in here.

192
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:40,299
<i>Like the Wrath of
the Wicked Wedgie Woman.</i>

193
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,935
And who could forget Sad Worm?

194
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:44,984
It was a worm who was sad.

195
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:49,901
That one's
still a work in progress.

196
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:52,057
But the all-time
greatest superhero

197
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:54,263
that we've ever created was...

198
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:58,058
<i>The Amazing Captain Underpants.</i>

199
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:01,262
See, most superheroes look like

200
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,178
they're flying around
in their underwear.

201
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:06,145
Well, this guy actually does.

202
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:08,098
Come on, let's get to work.

203
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:13,860
Hey, tell me what you think.

204
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:17,864
Oh, I can't wait to draw this.

205
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:19,176
Tra-la-laaa!

206
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:20,939
Wait, wait.
Don't move, don't move.

207
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:31,661
Mr. Hutchins, I gotta say...

208
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:33,311
your drawings get better
with every issue.

209
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:36,020
Because your words
inspire greatness, Mr. Beard.

210
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:38,296
Good night, Harold.

211
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:39,502
Good night, George.

212
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:56,826
I love Saturday

213
00:10:56,975 --> 00:10:59,979
<i>When anything is possible</i>

214
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,215
<i>I love Saturday</i>

215
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,857
<i>'Cause I can wear
my pajamas ail at! day</i>

216
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:09,339
<i>I love Saturday</i>

217
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,857
<i>'Cause I can watch
TV all day Day</i>

218
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:16,224
<i>I can pee a little bit
in my underwear</i>

219
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:20,181
<i>And no one will mind</i>

220
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:21,671
Where are you going with that?
Do you really do that?

221
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:23,265
No. What are you talking...

222
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:25,498
It's just something
I could do because...

223
00:11:25,655 --> 00:11:28,818
<i>Monday's an eternity away</i>

224
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:34,582
<i>when it is Saturday Saturday</i>

225
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,991
Get in the car, boys.

226
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,938
You've got the
Invention Convention today.

227
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:55,575
This thing on?

228
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,865
<i>Quick announcement.</i>

229
00:11:57,935 --> 00:12:00,779
<i>Our science teacher, Mr. Fyde,
is no longer with us.</i>

230
00:12:02,215 --> 00:12:03,216
He's dead?

231
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:05,742
<i>What? No. Not like that.</i>

232
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:07,784
<i>He wanted to spend Saturday
with his family.</i>

233
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:09,141
<i>So I fired him.</i>

234
00:12:09,215 --> 00:12:10,740
<i>I'll find a replacement
next week.</i>

235
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:12,260
<i>Ahem! Anyway.'-</i>

236
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:16,306
<i>on to Melvin Sneedly
with the first of his</i> 16...

237
00:12:16,815 --> 00:12:18,419
Actually, it's 17.

238
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:20,145
<i>17 inventions.</i>

239
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:21,626
<i>Take it away, Melvin.</i>

240
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:25,376
<i>I will now demonstrate
a prototype which I call...</i>

241
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:27,936
<i>the Robotic Sock Matcher.</i>

242
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:32,619
<i>Never waste time matching
your own socks again.</i>

243
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:34,777
<i>The Electromagnetic
Lint Collector.</i>

244
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:36,141
<i>Digital Paper Sorter.</i>

245
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:38,138
<i>It's the homework...
Automatic cushion.</i>

246
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:39,461
Make it end!

247
00:12:39,615 --> 00:12:43,142
<i>And the personal favorite,
the binder binder.</i>

248
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:45,815
<i>Having trouble
organizing your binders?</i>

249
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:49,980
<i>Well, look no further
than this giant binder...</i>

250
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:51,301
<i>for binders.</i>

251
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:53,311
Three-hole punch...

252
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:54,825
This is the stuff of nightmares.

253
00:12:58,815 --> 00:13:00,431
We have to do
something about this.

254
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:03,698
I don't know. Krupp looks
serious this time, George.

255
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:05,391
Maybe we should
just lay low for a while.

256
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:08,180
Lay low?
Look at our fellow children.

257
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:11,782
Look upon their sad,
miserable, pathetic faces.

258
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:14,301
Come on, Harold.

259
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:16,631
If you won't do it for me
and you won't do it for you...

260
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:18,384
do it for future generations.

261
00:13:18,535 --> 00:13:19,980
Save the first graders...

262
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:21,864
the kindygarteners,
the unborn...

263
00:13:22,015 --> 00:13:23,858
from a life of eternal boredom!

264
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,865
Okay, let's do this.

265
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:36,183
<i>Feast your eyes on this.</i>

266
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:39,657
<i>The Turbo Toilet 20001.!</i>

267
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:41,455
<i>Check it out, people.</i>

268
00:13:41,535 --> 00:13:42,696
<i>It's already programmed with</i>

269
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:43,935
<i>my persona! potty playlist.</i>

270
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:46,776
Screwdriver.

271
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:47,856
<i>Oh, samba!</i>

272
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:50,735
<i>Once you're done
using the facilities...</i>

273
00:13:50,855 --> 00:13:54,701
<i>hit the button
and let my toilet wash itself.</i>

274
00:13:55,655 --> 00:13:58,135
<i>Now included, automatic
toilet paper wiping claw.</i>

275
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,865
<i>Trademark.</i>

276
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:01,056
<i>Um...</i>

277
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:06,216
I said no!

278
00:14:09,895 --> 00:14:10,896
Huh? Oh...

279
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:12,540
Melvin, turn that thing off.

280
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:15,904
I'm trying to,
but it's not cooperating.

281
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:45,776
Best.
Prank.

282
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:46,936
Ever.

283
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:50,900
Well, that brings our story
to its happy conclusion.

284
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,495
I hope you've all
enjoyed the film.

285
00:14:52,535 --> 00:14:54,264
It was certainly shorter
than we expected.

286
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:55,616
What more is there to say?

287
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:57,982
Our fellow students got
to enjoy their weekend.

288
00:14:58,135 --> 00:15:01,298
Which, by the way,
they are legally entitled to.

289
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:04,299
And good triumphed over evil
once and for...

290
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:08,301
Oh, boys! A moment, please.

291
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:16,700
What's happening to his face?

292
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,182
I think he's smiling.

293
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,019
I'm so cold.

294
00:15:21,535 --> 00:15:23,537
So, <i>so</i> cold.

295
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:26,016
I'll let myself in,
receptionist lady.

296
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:27,656
Melvin.

297
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:28,861
What's he doing here?

298
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:32,178
You see, Melvin
is yet to demonstrate...

299
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:34,986
his most impressive invention
from today.

300
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:37,416
It was a little
extracurricular project

301
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:39,702
I asked him
to come up with myself.

302
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,665
I call him
the Tattle Turtle 200.

303
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:45,500
On the outside,
it resembles a turtle.

304
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:48,340
But on the inside,
oh, look at this.

305
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:51,496
<i>It's a nanny cam!</i>

306
00:15:51,695 --> 00:15:53,936
Oh, Melvin. How fun.

307
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:56,018
Let's see what it recorded.

308
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:02,858
Yeah, you gotta change
the input to video.

309
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:04,016
I think I got this.

310
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:05,586
You're on AUX.
Change it to video.

311
00:16:05,735 --> 00:16:06,782
It's not my TV.

312
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:08,191
It's your turtle.
You're doing it wrong.

313
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:09,296
I know.

314
00:16:09,455 --> 00:16:11,901
I think I know
how to do my office.

315
00:16:14,695 --> 00:16:15,821
<i>Screwdriver.</i>

316
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:20,780
<i>Is this two-ply or one-WI?</i>

317
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:23,060
<i>We're so guilty.</i>

318
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:25,986
<i>Quiet fives. Quiet fives.</i>

319
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:29,260
Wow, that nanny cam

320
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,740
really has good picture quality.

321
00:16:30,895 --> 00:16:31,895
Was that hi-def?

322
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:34,142
'Cause you could
really tell that's us.

323
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:37,777
I can't believe it.
I gotcha.

324
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:39,386
I finally gotcha!

325
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:42,057
We've finally got them, sir.

326
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:43,823
Yes, yes. Well done, Melvin.

327
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,059
Extra credit granted.

328
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,058
Put that in my pocket.

329
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:52,296
Extra credit, it feels so good!

330
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:54,264
<i>I</i> go! extra credit

331
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:56,463
I told you
I would get you one day.

332
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,266
And that day I was talking about

333
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:00,575
is this day.

334
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:03,102
Today. This is the day.

335
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,951
Are you going to tell
our parents?

336
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:07,421
No. Your parents are obviously
total failures.

337
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:11,136
I have a much more effective
punishment in mind.

338
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:15,778
Because I'm going to have
you two placed in separate...

339
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:18,256
classes.

340
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,951
I'm going to annihilate
your friendship.

341
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:21,976
What? No!

342
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:25,179
You see?
You won't be together.

343
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:27,179
You won't be able to enjoy

344
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,701
each other's company
and ruin my life.

345
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,176
Mr. Krupp, no.
You can't do this. Please.

346
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,457
This is too much.
I mean, even for you.

347
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:36,617
Enjoy the rest
of your weekend, boys.

348
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:38,459
Because come Monday...

349
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:51,185
Separate classes.
Our friendship's over.

350
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:52,825
I'll never see you again
in my life!

351
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:54,625
Hey, hey. Calm down.

352
00:17:54,815 --> 00:17:56,055
It's not the end of the world.

353
00:17:56,215 --> 00:17:57,341
We'll still be best friends.

354
00:17:57,455 --> 00:17:59,822
Just way down the hall
from each other.

355
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:03,976
What am I talking about?
This is bad.

356
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:06,058
Long distance relationships
never work!

357
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:09,305
This is just the beginning.

358
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:12,145
Imagine the future.

359
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:16,976
<i>Friends separated...</i>

360
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:20,697
<i>promising each other
they'll remain besties.</i>

361
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:30,266
<i>But within months,</i>

362
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:32,656
<i>we'll be awkwardly bumping
into each other at the mall.</i>

363
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:34,186
Hey, George.

364
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:36,019
Hey. Do I know you?

365
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:37,939
<i>You'll have a weird haircut.</i>

366
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:40,257
<i>I'll be wearing
a suit for some reason.</i>

367
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:41,541
<i>And before we know it,</i>

368
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:43,535
<i>separate classes
will lead to separate lives...</i>

369
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:45,623
<i>which inevitably
leads to robots.</i>

370
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:48,537
What? Why are there robots
at the mall?

371
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:51,096
Because this is the future!
The future always has robots.

372
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,740
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

373
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:54,778
Why are the robots
shooting other robots?

374
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:56,295
Aren't they
supposed to be friends?

375
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:57,416
I don't know!

376
00:18:57,575 --> 00:18:58,671
I'm the artist,
you're the writer.

377
00:18:58,695 --> 00:18:59,935
That's why we need each other.

378
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:08,061
Help! Fire!

379
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,377
Okay, you're right.
No, you are right.

380
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:18,299
I mean, if we get put
in separate classes,

381
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,104
it's the end of the world
as we know it.

382
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:21,416
What are we gonna do?

383
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:23,418
Oh, I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

384
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:26,585
First thing Monday morning,
we're getting that turtle.

385
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:35,256
Edith!

386
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:36,940
Oh, is this a bad time?

387
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:39,740
I did not mean to interrupt
the copying process.

388
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:40,896
I'll go.

389
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,135
Yes, go! Please go.

390
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:44,343
No, no. I'm just finishing up.

391
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:49,095
What brings you around here?

392
00:19:49,975 --> 00:19:52,421
I just made
this tuna casserole...

393
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:55,101
and I noticed
it had your name on it...

394
00:19:55,255 --> 00:19:57,576
In jalapeño peppers.

395
00:19:57,775 --> 00:19:58,981
Mmm...

396
00:19:59,255 --> 00:20:01,257
It smells spicy.

397
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:02,940
Yep. Mmm-hmm.

398
00:20:03,095 --> 00:20:05,257
That's 'cause it's been
dry-aged for a week.

399
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:06,826
I don't know what that means,

400
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:08,425
but it sounds
very time-consuming.

401
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:09,946
It took a week.

402
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:12,621
Eww. They like each other.

403
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:14,618
Oh, no, George.
I think it's much worse.

404
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:16,504
They like-like each other.

405
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:17,736
What are you talking about?

406
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:19,544
Adults don't
like-like other adults.

407
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:21,311
Well, you probably haven't
seen it at your home

408
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:22,575
since your parents are married.

409
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:25,300
In my studies, like-liking
seems to end with marriage.

410
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:27,751
Well, I should probably gel
back to running the school.

411
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,584
You know,
it's not gonna run itself.

412
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:32,341
But...

413
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:37,858
Oh, Edith. Get your head
out of the clouds.

414
00:20:38,815 --> 00:20:42,058
Wait, Edith! You never gave me
the tuna casserole.

415
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:44,664
I think he forgot the turtle.

416
00:20:44,815 --> 00:20:46,055
Go, go, go-

417
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,661
That's important.

418
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,385
Great. What now?

419
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,181
<i>Hello.
If you would like the chance</i>

420
00:20:57,335 --> 00:20:59,144
<i>to win one billion dollars...
Ooh.</i>

421
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:01,064
Please hold for
one of our representatives.

422
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:17,064
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

423
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:19,016
Ugh.

424
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:23,506
Whoa!
What?

425
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:25,862
Everything Krupp
ever confiscated from us.

426
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:27,699
Look at all that stuff.

427
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,624
Oh, dear old whoopee cushion.

428
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:31,539
You will sing once again.

429
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:36,543
Oh, my
Super Duper Soaking Machine!

430
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:39,256
MY hypno-ring!

431
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,457
I never even got to take it
out of the wrapper.

432
00:21:42,495 --> 00:21:43,495
Wow.

433
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,536
Look at this.

434
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:46,231
He's got every issue
of Captain Underpants

435
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:47,302
we've ever created.

436
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:48,456
You think he reads them?

437
00:21:48,615 --> 00:21:49,831
I was kinda hoping
that we appealed

438
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:51,584
to a slightly
cooler demographic.

439
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:55,984
Well, if it isn't George Beard
and Harold Hutchins.

440
00:21:56,135 --> 00:21:58,137
To what do I owe the pleasure?

441
00:21:58,295 --> 00:22:00,059
Is it perhaps this?

442
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:01,296
Oh, no.

443
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:02,616
Nice try.

444
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:04,738
Turtle and I have grown
quite attached.

445
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:06,545
We're inseparable, actually.

446
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:08,225
I carry him wherever I go.

447
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,662
Including the shower!

448
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:13,940
<i>Oh.
Poor 'name.</i>

449
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:18,906
Oh, what's this?

450
00:22:19,895 --> 00:22:20,896
Why, it's the paperwork

451
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:22,898
to separate you two.

452
00:22:23,215 --> 00:22:24,296
It's really incredible.

453
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:27,897
I can actually see
the end of your friendship.

454
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,422
And it ends right here.

455
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:32,577
On this dotted line.

456
00:22:33,255 --> 00:22:34,780
George, do something.

457
00:22:35,495 --> 00:22:36,985
Put the pen down, Mr. Krupp...

458
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:38,500
or we'll hypnotize you.

459
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:39,656
What?
What?

460
00:22:39,815 --> 00:22:40,976
You said do something.

461
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:42,182
What is that?

462
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:45,976
Forged from the molten
plastic of Shandong, China.

463
00:22:46,135 --> 00:22:48,615
<i>In the lowest floor
of the darkest basement</i>

464
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:51,779
<i>where only toy prizes
dare be made...</i>

465
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:53,778
<i>exists the most powerful item...</i>

466
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:57,337
<i>ever to be found in a box
of Frosted Sugar Doodles.</i>

467
00:22:58,015 --> 00:22:59,938
The hypno-ring.

468
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:01,621
Hypnotize me?

469
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:03,504
With that piece of plastic junk?

470
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:05,856
Does that really work?

471
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:07,983
What do you think?
I got it out of a cereal box.

472
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:09,216
I'm warning you.

473
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,431
If you don't do what we say,

474
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:11,695
you're gonna get really sleepy.

475
00:23:11,815 --> 00:23:14,386
Oh, will I?
I'll get sleepy?

476
00:23:14,535 --> 00:23:16,185
With that thing pointing at me'?

477
00:23:16,335 --> 00:23:17,985
It's not making me sleepy.

478
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:22,704
I'm not gonna get sleepy from...

479
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:23,896
Whoa!

480
00:23:26,815 --> 00:23:29,341
What kind of
plastic hokum is this?

481
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:30,621
Whoa!

482
00:23:30,815 --> 00:23:31,991
What's happening?
I don't know.

483
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:33,665
Why are we floating?

484
00:23:47,815 --> 00:23:49,146
What was that?

485
00:23:49,335 --> 00:23:50,416
I don't know.

486
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,135
I honestly didn't think
that would happen.

487
00:23:57,615 --> 00:24:00,186
Gotcha. You're safe now,
little turtle.

488
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,026
<i>When I snap my fingers,</i>

489
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:05,859
you will obey our every command.

490
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:07,346
Wait. How do you know this?

491
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:08,631
I don't know.
I just say the first thing

492
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,311
that comes to my mind
with great authority.

493
00:24:10,335 --> 00:24:12,497
You are now a chicken.

494
00:24:23,535 --> 00:24:24,536
N worked!

495
00:24:25,175 --> 00:24:26,256
He's a chicken.

496
00:24:26,455 --> 00:24:27,695
Okay, let me try. Let me try.

497
00:24:28,575 --> 00:24:29,781
You're a monkey.

498
00:24:35,695 --> 00:24:37,697
Oh! Look at him,
he's a monkey!

499
00:24:45,535 --> 00:24:46,535
Come on.

500
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:47,701
You are now

501
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:50,705
the greatest superhero
of all time...

502
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:53,501
the amazing Captain Underpants!

503
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:11,020
Tra-la-laaaaa!

504
00:25:12,415 --> 00:25:15,897
Captain Underpants?
Is that really you?

505
00:25:16,455 --> 00:25:17,661
Let's see.

506
00:25:17,815 --> 00:25:19,579
Underpants, check.

507
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:21,942
Captain, also check.

508
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:25,344
I'm pretty sure
I'm Captain Underpants.

509
00:25:27,615 --> 00:25:28,616
It worked!

510
00:25:29,855 --> 00:25:32,426
Which must make you
my trusty sidekicks!

511
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:33,816
Sidekicks?

512
00:25:34,255 --> 00:25:37,623
Fear not, this planet is safe
under my watchful eye.

513
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:39,425
This is hilarious!
This is amazing!

514
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:40,935
Let's see what's afoot.

515
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:43,096
Wait, no!

516
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:46,778
Well, that was invigorating.

517
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:48,460
We gotta stop him.
Why?

518
00:25:49,735 --> 00:25:50,735
Huzzah!

519
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:51,776
Out of the road, bozo!

520
00:25:51,935 --> 00:25:53,664
Why, thank you, vehicle person!

521
00:25:53,855 --> 00:25:54,902
Ow!

522
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:56,500
Yeah, we should
probably go get him.

523
00:25:58,255 --> 00:26:00,257
Captain Underpants, wait!

524
00:26:04,335 --> 00:26:05,666
Oh!
Ha-ha!

525
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:07,056
What is this?

526
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,504
Poor soul. You're trapped

527
00:26:09,615 --> 00:26:12,459
in some sort of
invisible box-like prison.

528
00:26:12,615 --> 00:26:15,061
What's that? I can't hear you.

529
00:26:15,215 --> 00:26:16,899
But I see your tears.

530
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:19,137
Is it okay
that I'm kinda loving this?

531
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:21,138
Yes and no. But mostly yes.

532
00:26:21,975 --> 00:26:23,977
Fear not
for I will set you free!

533
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:25,056
Ow!
Ooh!

534
00:26:25,175 --> 00:26:26,301
What is wrong with you?

535
00:26:26,495 --> 00:26:28,145
Ah, that's better.
I can hear you now.

536
00:26:28,575 --> 00:26:30,020
Sorry, sorry. We're so sorry.

537
00:26:30,175 --> 00:26:31,215
Okay, listen, let's not be

538
00:26:31,335 --> 00:26:32,631
punching people,
though, because...

539
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:33,986
Hold n.

540
00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:36,340
Here, let me help.
Oh!

541
00:26:36,415 --> 00:26:38,338
You're welcome, madam.

542
00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:39,831
You know,
we should probably get you

543
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:41,471
back to the school
before anything else...

544
00:26:41,495 --> 00:26:42,496
Halt!
What?

545
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:44,339
Do you sense that?
No.

546
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:45,542
Well, of course you don't.

547
00:26:45,655 --> 00:26:47,180
You're not a superhero like me.

548
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:49,576
Come, sidekicks.
Evil lurks within!

549
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:50,736
Oh, no!

550
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:54,700
Where'd he go now?

551
00:26:54,895 --> 00:26:56,943
To the sky!

552
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:08,271
You'd think a guy like him
would be easy to find.

553
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,295
Found him.

554
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:11,941
Stand down,
you giant ape monster!

555
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:14,746
Giant ape monster?
What is he talking...

556
00:27:15,295 --> 00:27:18,697
Your days of terrifying
this town are over!

557
00:27:18,855 --> 00:27:20,619
Mr. Krupp!
I mean, Captain Underpants!

558
00:27:20,775 --> 00:27:23,221
You can't actually fly!

559
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,298
Now I take to the sky...

560
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:26,581
like an ostrich!

561
00:27:30,455 --> 00:27:32,105
<i>I</i> gotcha!

562
00:27:35,935 --> 00:27:37,585
We gotta do something.

563
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:39,061
I've got an idea.

564
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:42,420
Morning.
Morning.

565
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:46,464
Oh, that is a lot of buttons.

566
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:51,736
Take that! Ah, cheap shot!

567
00:27:52,095 --> 00:27:53,904
Ow! Right in the kisser!

568
00:27:55,455 --> 00:27:56,456
No!

569
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:00,736
Oh, hi, guys!

570
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:01,942
Wait! No!

571
00:28:02,295 --> 00:28:03,342
Follow that gorilla!

572
00:28:05,415 --> 00:28:07,258
Oh, you put up a good fight!

573
00:28:10,415 --> 00:28:13,339
Yeah! You are so good
at operating a crane, Harold.

574
00:28:13,495 --> 00:28:15,259
I know!
It's really not that hard.

575
00:28:15,855 --> 00:28:17,135
Rest assured,

576
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:18,825
citizens of
this marvelous metropolis...

577
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:21,626
I will rid you of this menace
any moment now!

578
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:24,625
Come on. Oh, come on,
come on, come on.

579
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:25,981
Victory!

580
00:28:26,135 --> 00:28:27,421
Yes!
Bravo!

581
00:28:27,615 --> 00:28:28,855
Oh, no, no, no!

582
00:28:32,815 --> 00:28:36,137
Let that be a lesson
to evildoers everywhere.

583
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:39,464
Never underestimate the power
of underwear!

584
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:41,379
Who the heck are you?

585
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:42,455
What the...

586
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:50,460
Wow! I can't believe
we found a spot.

587
00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:53,016
Oh, goodness.
Grandpa, you did it again.

588
00:28:53,535 --> 00:28:54,616
He's a sleepwalker.

589
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,857
Come on, pap pap,
let's get you back into bed.

590
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:58,699
But what about all the other
evil villains?

591
00:28:58,895 --> 00:29:00,101
Well, don't worry about that.

592
00:29:00,175 --> 00:29:01,815
There's no more
evil villains around here.

593
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:06,825
A science teacher, hmm?

594
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:08,977
The perfect cover.

595
00:29:15,495 --> 00:29:18,817
Chums! What
an astounding headquarters.

596
00:29:18,975 --> 00:29:20,864
Stuffed full of relics...

597
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:24,224
all celebrating
my interplanetary exploits!

598
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,979
Oh, this takes me back.

599
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:28,383
What are we gonna do?
He can't just stay here.

600
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:30,060
We have to turn him back
into Krupp.

601
00:29:30,215 --> 00:29:31,785
I know,
but can we just take a moment

602
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,575
to acknowledge
what's happening here please?

603
00:29:33,695 --> 00:29:37,541
I mean, Captain Underpants is
hanging out in our tree house!

604
00:29:38,175 --> 00:29:40,064
Look at the cute little turtle.

605
00:29:40,175 --> 00:29:41,904
Oh, he's so adorable.

606
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,065
Well, a hero's work
is never done.

607
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:48,337
Now it is time to fly again!

608
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,781
No, no, no, no!

609
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:52,616
Where am I?

610
00:29:52,775 --> 00:29:54,061
Where are my pants?

611
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:55,262
Oh, no! He's Krupp again.

612
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,746
Ah!

613
00:29:57,055 --> 00:29:58,705
Tra-la-laaa!

614
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:00,935
That's it! Now we know
what turns him hack and forth.

615
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:02,176
Turns who what?

616
00:30:02,695 --> 00:30:03,696
Why am I soaking wet?

617
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:05,016
Cool.
Hey.

618
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:06,865
Tra-la-laaa!

619
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,904
Harold!
Tra-Ia...

620
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:10,784
George!
Laaa!

621
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,096
We should probably stop.

622
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:13,381
Yeah, we probably should.

623
00:30:13,535 --> 00:30:15,378
Stop doing this!
Tra-la...

624
00:30:15,455 --> 00:30:17,105
I am Captain...

625
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,551
What are you doing?

626
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:19,576
Hello? Well, hello!

627
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,544
What's happening?
Fear not!

628
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,351
Didn't know I could do this.
Hey, sidekicks!

629
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,786
Tra! Hey! Heyo!

630
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:28,976
Tra-la-laaa!

631
00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:33,100
Okay, this is the street.

632
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:35,655
Come on, come on.
We're almost there.

633
00:30:38,455 --> 00:30:39,900
Evening.
Evening.

634
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:43,102
Drop it. No, get off. Gimme!
That's a bad dog.

635
00:30:50,895 --> 00:30:51,942
We made it.

636
00:30:52,735 --> 00:30:53,736
Yeesh.

637
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,977
I wonder
what horrors lie inside.

638
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:58,978
There's probably
wild dogs in there.

639
00:30:59,135 --> 00:31:00,535
Probably torture implements.

640
00:31:00,575 --> 00:31:01,576
Rabid rats.

641
00:31:01,655 --> 00:31:02,736
Brains in jars.

642
00:31:02,935 --> 00:31:04,425
Jars of plucked-out eyeballs.

643
00:31:04,575 --> 00:31:06,304
Bones of former students.

644
00:31:13,615 --> 00:31:14,696
Why'd you scream?

645
00:31:14,855 --> 00:31:16,619
I just assumed
there'd be something scary...

646
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,700
but it's actually
a really nice place.

647
00:31:25,295 --> 00:31:26,660
We probably
shouldn't snoop around.

648
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:28,658
Yeah. Definitely not.

649
00:31:31,175 --> 00:31:32,176
Come on.

650
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:36,936
Huh.

651
00:31:38,615 --> 00:31:39,616
Hmm.

652
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:42,978
Not So Cheery O's?

653
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:45,138
This guy's bumming me out.

654
00:31:52,655 --> 00:31:54,896
I gotta say, this has
not been the funnest snoop.

655
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:58,184
Yeah, no, totally.
Really sad snoop.

656
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:00,144
Kinda regretting it, actually.

657
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,706
I sure hope we don't ever
end up like him.

658
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:13,345
All alone.

659
00:32:14,495 --> 00:32:16,615
It's impossible.
That would never happen.

660
00:32:16,695 --> 00:32:18,697
Yeah, yeah.
That'll never happen.

661
00:32:19,695 --> 00:32:22,505
<i>Unless he puts us
in separate classes.</i>

662
00:32:24,095 --> 00:32:26,257
Which will never happen.

663
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:30,258
It'll never happen.
'Cause we control him now.

664
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,065
And if ever gives us
any trouble again,

665
00:32:32,175 --> 00:32:33,859
all we gotta do
is snap our fingers...

666
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:35,426
and "Tra-la-laa!"

667
00:32:35,615 --> 00:32:38,061
All of our problems go away.

668
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:49,019
Oh, yeah

669
00:32:58,095 --> 00:32:59,540
<i>Beautiful</i>

670
00:33:04,535 --> 00:33:06,697
<i>Even more beautiful</i>

671
00:33:10,575 --> 00:33:11,695
Hey, Tommy. What's going on?

672
00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:12,776
<i>Hey, guys-</i>

673
00:33:13,055 --> 00:33:14,898
Whoa! Cool shirts!

674
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:17,745
What are you two doing together?

675
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,786
I separated you.

676
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:21,735
No, you didn't.

677
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:22,936
What are you talking about?

678
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:25,416
I signed the paperwork. See?

679
00:33:25,495 --> 00:33:26,496
I don't see a signature.

680
00:33:26,575 --> 00:33:27,711
Harold, do you see a signature?

681
00:33:27,735 --> 00:33:29,225
Not a thing.

682
00:33:29,415 --> 00:33:31,775
I actually can't see a thing.
These sunglasses are too dark.

683
00:33:31,895 --> 00:33:34,296
What? I could have sworn
I signed that thing.

684
00:33:34,455 --> 00:33:36,822
No matter. There!

685
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,579
Officially separated.

686
00:33:38,735 --> 00:33:40,339
Forever.

687
00:33:42,335 --> 00:33:45,259
What? Give me that.
Tra-la-laaa!

688
00:33:45,415 --> 00:33:46,985
See? Problem solved.

689
00:33:47,415 --> 00:33:49,019
Ooh!

690
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:52,419
Greetings, citizens!

691
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:53,576
Quick, in here.

692
00:33:57,015 --> 00:33:58,062
Okay, you know what?

693
00:33:58,135 --> 00:33:59,625
These shirts were way premature.

694
00:33:59,775 --> 00:34:01,106
Definitely. Come on.

695
00:34:01,255 --> 00:34:02,391
Let's turn him back into Krupp.

696
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,497
We can't. He'll separate us,
remember?

697
00:34:04,935 --> 00:34:06,071
Yeah, well, we can't have him

698
00:34:06,095 --> 00:34:07,540
wandering around
looking like that.

699
00:34:07,775 --> 00:34:09,857
A triangle!

700
00:34:09,935 --> 00:34:12,222
<i>It</i> dings!

701
00:34:26,135 --> 00:34:28,741
Ah! Principal Krupp,
you caught us again.

702
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:31,625
You better take us
to your office

703
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:33,578
for a good old talking-to.

704
00:34:34,135 --> 00:34:35,864
Right? Principal Krupp?

705
00:34:36,015 --> 00:34:37,311
Principal who?

706
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:38,860
Captain Underpants,
get out here.

707
00:34:40,015 --> 00:34:41,016
Sidekicks...

708
00:34:41,175 --> 00:34:42,176
are you sure

709
00:34:42,295 --> 00:34:44,024
my secret identity
requires these...

710
00:34:44,655 --> 00:34:47,340
restricting,
uncomfortable clothes?

711
00:34:47,535 --> 00:34:48,536
Yes, positive.

712
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:51,505
100% positive.
Now act like a principal.

713
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:52,702
Oh, right.

714
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:54,341
How does a principal act?

715
00:34:54,455 --> 00:34:55,455
Mean!

716
00:34:55,495 --> 00:34:56,542
Okey-doke.

717
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:01,506
I'm a principal!

718
00:35:02,015 --> 00:35:03,016
Oh, yeah. That's great.

719
00:35:03,655 --> 00:35:05,180
Come on. We're almost there.

720
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,823
Oh, hello. Surprise.

721
00:35:09,495 --> 00:35:11,020
It's Edith.

722
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,177
Did you like my tuna casserole?

723
00:35:13,855 --> 00:35:15,664
I cannot lie.

724
00:35:15,855 --> 00:35:18,381
I don't recall
having your tuna casserole.

725
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:20,344
What? Oh.

726
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:21,906
But if your casserole is

727
00:35:22,015 --> 00:35:25,224
as striking
<i>as</i> your one blue eye...

728
00:35:25,695 --> 00:35:28,346
Oh, I didn't think you noticed.

729
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:29,736
Oh, my.

730
00:35:30,855 --> 00:35:32,903
Two blue eyes.

731
00:35:34,055 --> 00:35:35,864
Ooh!

732
00:35:36,695 --> 00:35:38,379
Principal Krupp.
It's time to go.

733
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:39,696
Gotta wrap it up.

734
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:41,016
Very well then.

735
00:35:41,215 --> 00:35:42,376
Up, up, and...

736
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:44,537
And this way, sir.

737
00:35:44,855 --> 00:35:47,699
Ooh! Flirt alert.

738
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:49,220
A-ha!

739
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:51,826
Wow, she's still on hold.

740
00:35:53,535 --> 00:35:55,219
Phew! We made it.

741
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,104
Well, hello, citizen.
What?

742
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,295
Oh, and hello to you, too.

743
00:35:58,415 --> 00:36:00,417
I was just, like,
admiring the view...

744
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,225
from your broken window.

745
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,104
It's in the shape of a man.

746
00:36:04,255 --> 00:36:05,461
Anyway, lam here to interview

747
00:36:05,575 --> 00:36:07,100
for the science teacher
position.

748
00:36:07,255 --> 00:36:08,620
Perfect. I'm disguised

749
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:10,180
as an elementary
school principal.

750
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,900
Guys, I totally got this.

751
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:14,580
Don't worry one bit.

752
00:36:18,615 --> 00:36:21,061
Now, where did I put
that resume?

753
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:22,415
No, not that. Oh, this thing.

754
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:24,416
This one's fun.

755
00:36:24,575 --> 00:36:25,781
Ooh!
Heads up.

756
00:36:25,895 --> 00:36:27,385
That one's gonna leave a mark.

757
00:36:27,535 --> 00:36:28,900
I've been looking for that.

758
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:30,096
Oh, not that.

759
00:36:31,695 --> 00:36:32,776
Ah-ha! Here we go.

760
00:36:34,935 --> 00:36:38,064
Hmm. Says here
you're a science teacher?

761
00:36:38,215 --> 00:36:39,421
Not exactly.

762
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:41,577
But you have
teaching experience?

763
00:36:41,775 --> 00:36:43,106
Oh, no, I can't say that I do.

764
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,378
Not even, like, babysitting?

765
00:36:45,535 --> 00:36:46,775
I would never sit on a baby.

766
00:36:46,935 --> 00:36:47,936
Camp counselor?

767
00:36:48,095 --> 00:36:49,381
Never was a camp counselor.

768
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:51,065
Although
I did receive counseling...

769
00:36:51,215 --> 00:36:54,458
for some trauma I experienced
as a child.

770
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:57,455
I'm getting a really good vibe
about you.

771
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,583
Now hold on.
Let me see that resume.

772
00:36:59,735 --> 00:37:01,942
It says here that you were
a genius inventor?

773
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,301
Mad...

774
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:06,977
genius inventor.
But yes.

775
00:37:07,175 --> 00:37:09,098
And then for
the last few years...

776
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:10,939
you've "been in
a very dark place"...

777
00:37:11,135 --> 00:37:12,341
and your title was...

778
00:37:12,495 --> 00:37:14,418
"Revenge Seeker?"

779
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:15,940
"Revenge at all costs...

780
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:17,096
"Die! Die!"

781
00:37:17,255 --> 00:37:18,256
Am I reading this right?

782
00:37:18,415 --> 00:37:20,497
Yeah, that's basically
what I've been up to...

783
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,419
so here I am!

784
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:23,736
Applying for a job in

785
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:26,295
the thriving
public school system...

786
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:29,664
with all of
its amazing resources.

787
00:37:30,255 --> 00:37:33,020
But honestly,
kids are so understanding.

788
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:34,779
So innocent.

789
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:37,939
Their smiles brighten my heart
and fill me with...

790
00:37:38,095 --> 00:37:41,019
a joy-adjacent feeling.

791
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,496
As long
as they are controlled...

792
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:46,465
and do not laugh
nor smile nor play nor laugh.

793
00:37:46,615 --> 00:37:48,185
Children must never laugh!

794
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,818
Well, you seem terrific!

795
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:52,136
You're hired!

796
00:37:52,295 --> 00:37:53,865
What?
Excellent.

797
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:56,023
Oh, by the way,
going to need Fridays off...

798
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:58,064
and every other Tuesday
through Thursday...

799
00:37:58,215 --> 00:37:59,501
for my evil experiments.

800
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:02,340
Hope that's not a problem.
Okay, bye-bye!

801
00:38:03,975 --> 00:38:05,056
Oh, this is bad.

802
00:38:05,215 --> 00:38:07,502
We just hired a maniac
for a science teacher!

803
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:10,022
Uh, yeah. We gotta fix this
before Krupp finds out.

804
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:12,304
Sounds like a job
for Captain Underpants.

805
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:14,696
No, no, no.
You need to stay here.

806
00:38:14,855 --> 00:38:16,380
Okay, you're
the principal, remember?

807
00:38:16,575 --> 00:38:18,862
Yeah, just sit there
and look angry for no reason.

808
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:21,177
You got it. Grr...

809
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:27,696
Ooh!

810
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,343
That will be interesting
to put my eye up to.

811
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:32,897
What?
How did I get here?

812
00:38:33,095 --> 00:38:34,335
Why is my face wet?

813
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:48,701
Hiya, class.

814
00:38:48,855 --> 00:38:50,220
I'm your cool, new teacher.

815
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:53,618
Not some scary guy
with a secret evil agenda.

816
00:38:55,695 --> 00:38:58,175
Anyway, I'm just going to dive
right in here.

817
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,575
If there was one thing

818
00:38:59,695 --> 00:39:01,295
about this world
that you could change...

819
00:39:01,735 --> 00:39:02,736
what would it be?

820
00:39:02,895 --> 00:39:04,738
Ooh! Ooh! Peace on Earth.

821
00:39:04,895 --> 00:39:06,897
Unattainable. Anyone else?

822
00:39:07,735 --> 00:39:09,419
Pacific Ocean into chocolate.

823
00:39:09,575 --> 00:39:11,065
Atlantic into nacho cheese.

824
00:39:11,255 --> 00:39:12,620
Ifs like we're the same person

825
00:39:12,735 --> 00:39:13,896
and yet so, so different.

826
00:39:14,095 --> 00:39:15,745
I love it.

827
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,545
But more importantly...

828
00:39:17,695 --> 00:39:21,097
if I had to change one thing
about the world...

829
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:24,941
it would be to get rid of...

830
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:26,096
laughter.

831
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:29,826
Get rid of laughter?

832
00:39:29,975 --> 00:39:31,545
What kind of person
wants to do that?

833
00:39:31,655 --> 00:39:32,656
Oh, Oh! Ah! Ah! Sir, sir.

834
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:33,776
<i>Yes'?</i>

835
00:39:33,855 --> 00:39:34,856
I love it.

836
00:39:34,935 --> 00:39:36,778
Oh, look at this.
We got a grade A suck-up.

837
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:38,824
Good to know, good to know.

838
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:39,976
<i>Anyway.</i>

839
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:44,982
This is the brain
of an average child.

840
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:46,182
Right here is

841
00:39:46,295 --> 00:39:48,263
the "thinking about candy"
lopalus.

842
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:50,463
The "fear of
what's under the bed" lobe.

843
00:39:50,615 --> 00:39:53,141
This is the "only thing
I'll eat is pizza...

844
00:39:53,295 --> 00:39:55,980
"chicken nuggets,
or buttered noodles" lobe.

845
00:39:56,175 --> 00:39:57,745
Right here is the

846
00:39:57,815 --> 00:39:59,658
"as soon as
someone else has a toy...

847
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:02,261
"I want that toy" anterior lobe.

848
00:40:02,815 --> 00:40:04,146
And this...

849
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:08,144
This is the
Hahaguffawchuckleamalus.

850
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,697
This funny little purple part

851
00:40:10,815 --> 00:40:14,137
holds our entire capacity
for laughter.

852
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:16,696
For years,
I've tried to shrink it

853
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:18,783
or cut it out entirely...

854
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:22,419
but frustratingly,

855
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:25,499
our survival seems
dependent upon it.

856
00:40:26,495 --> 00:40:28,782
I don't like this. I mean,
I don't really understand it.

857
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,215
But the stuff I am understanding

858
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:31,501
seems genuinely bad to me.

859
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:32,861
Yeah, same.

860
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:35,939
Um... Excuse me, Professor P?

861
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:37,978
Why are you trying to
get rid of laughter?

862
00:40:38,175 --> 00:40:39,506
Isn't laughter
the best medicine?

863
00:40:39,655 --> 00:40:43,137
Medicine is the best medicine!
So...

864
00:40:43,335 --> 00:40:44,461
Yeesh.

865
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:46,856
What?

866
00:40:47,015 --> 00:40:48,062
What does the P stand for?

867
00:40:48,535 --> 00:40:49,536
Excuse me?

868
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,856
The P. In your name.
What does it stand for?

869
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:53,505
Oh, it's private.

870
00:40:53,695 --> 00:40:57,063
So that means your name is
Professor Privates?

871
00:41:00,175 --> 00:41:01,700
What's so funny?

872
00:41:01,855 --> 00:41:03,061
I don't get it.

873
00:41:04,535 --> 00:41:05,582
Principal's office, now!

874
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:06,696
You too!

875
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:07,981
Why him?

876
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:10,581
Because your friendship
and shared sense of humor

877
00:41:10,695 --> 00:41:11,856
irritates me...

878
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:14,222
and must be destroyed!

879
00:41:15,855 --> 00:41:17,935
We gotta do something about
that new science teacher.

880
00:41:18,015 --> 00:41:20,382
Yeah, it's like he's even more
of a villain than Krupp.

881
00:41:20,535 --> 00:41:22,264
I didn't even think
that was possible.

882
00:41:22,415 --> 00:41:23,911
Whoa! Whoa! Wait a second.
Tell me about it.

883
00:41:23,935 --> 00:41:25,585
What? Who do you think...

884
00:41:25,735 --> 00:41:27,575
Oh, okay. Maybe we could
fix this if we just...

885
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:29,265
Can you hear me?
No, that'll never work.

886
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:31,184
I'm sitting right here.

887
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:33,781
Wait, Professor P doesn't want
anybody to know his last name.

888
00:41:33,935 --> 00:41:35,016
Right?
Right!

889
00:41:35,175 --> 00:41:36,859
Who's Professor P?
Exactly!

890
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:40,736
Where is the respect?
I am your principal!

891
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:42,776
Wait, is he Krupp again?

892
00:41:42,935 --> 00:41:44,778
George!
Yup. Pretty sure he is.

893
00:41:44,895 --> 00:41:45,896
Harold!

894
00:41:45,975 --> 00:41:46,976
How'd that even happen?

895
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:49,859
Tra-la-laaa!

896
00:41:50,015 --> 00:41:53,064
Greetings!
I need to get the...

897
00:41:53,255 --> 00:41:54,535
Sidekicks, what do I need again?

898
00:41:54,575 --> 00:41:56,862
The file
on the new science teacher.

899
00:41:56,935 --> 00:41:57,936
Oh, right, right.

900
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,416
I need the bile
on the gooey fence creature.

901
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,781
Science teacher.

902
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:02,936
The dewy tense preacher?

903
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:06,264
The dial on the...

904
00:42:06,415 --> 00:42:07,746
Oh, come on!

905
00:42:07,935 --> 00:42:09,903
Thank you, human woman!

906
00:42:10,535 --> 00:42:11,900
Sidekicks, explain to me

907
00:42:11,975 --> 00:42:13,784
the importance
of this secret file.

908
00:42:13,935 --> 00:42:15,295
There's a new
super villain in town

909
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:17,015
and we're trying to
discover his weakness.

910
00:42:17,095 --> 00:42:18,096
Oh...

911
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,258
"Poopypants."

912
00:42:25,495 --> 00:42:27,623
<i>Hallelujah</i>

913
00:42:27,775 --> 00:42:29,584
<i>Hallelujah</i>

914
00:42:29,735 --> 00:42:31,942
<i>His name is Poopypants
We found his weakness</i>

915
00:42:32,095 --> 00:42:34,097
<i>Hallelujah</i>

916
00:42:34,615 --> 00:42:37,983
<i>He wants to rid the world</i>

917
00:42:38,175 --> 00:42:40,496
<i>Of laughter</i>

918
00:42:40,655 --> 00:42:41,656
<i>Forever</i>

919
00:42:41,815 --> 00:42:42,816
<i>And ever</i>

920
00:42:42,975 --> 00:42:44,022
<i>We will defeat him</i>

921
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:47,463
<i>Hallelujah Hallelujah</i>

922
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:54,141
<i>Poopypants</i>

923
00:43:00,295 --> 00:43:01,820
Captain?
You forgetting something?

924
00:43:01,975 --> 00:43:04,342
Oh, look at that.
They came off again.

925
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:07,541
Hey there, kiddo.

926
00:43:07,695 --> 00:43:09,265
First day for Professor P.

927
00:43:09,455 --> 00:43:11,378
Can you tell me where
the lunch is consumed?

928
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:14,540
What's going on with your face?

929
00:43:14,695 --> 00:43:15,696
Are you choking?

930
00:43:15,855 --> 00:43:17,016
Do you need to sneeze?

931
00:43:18,455 --> 00:43:19,820
I see, I see.

932
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:22,979
Got a case of
the giggles' huh? That's fun.

933
00:43:23,175 --> 00:43:25,781
Well, I've got
just the remedy for that.

934
00:43:27,175 --> 00:43:29,064
In the cage. Now!
Why?

935
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:30,819
Because I hate
laughter and children...

936
00:43:31,015 --> 00:43:33,063
and I've got a cage
in a briefcase!

937
00:43:34,335 --> 00:43:36,861
Okay, well, have a nice day.

938
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:38,858
Now what's for lunch?

939
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:46,702
Excuse me, could you explain
to me why this is funny?

940
00:43:46,855 --> 00:43:48,698
You! Why is everyone laughing?

941
00:43:49,015 --> 00:43:52,542
Uh, you're asking
the wrong dude.

942
00:43:52,815 --> 00:43:56,740
<i>"Captain Underpants
and the Perilous Plot of...</i>

943
00:43:56,895 --> 00:43:58,738
<i>"Professor Poem/pants."</i>

944
00:44:02,735 --> 00:44:04,151
Oh, What's happening?

945
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:05,904
I'm hyperventilating.

946
00:44:06,095 --> 00:44:07,256
Esteemed members

947
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:09,423
of the Nobel Prize Committee...

948
00:44:09,575 --> 00:44:11,657
it is with great pride...

949
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,499
that I present to you...

950
00:44:13,655 --> 00:44:17,376
the Sizerator 2000!

951
00:44:17,495 --> 00:44:18,576
- Oh.
- Ooh.

952
00:44:18,775 --> 00:44:21,699
Behold, we can smallify.

953
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:26,341
No more traffic jams.

954
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,736
And conversely, largify.

955
00:44:34,055 --> 00:44:36,023
Look at how big this hot dog is.

956
00:44:36,575 --> 00:44:40,296
Going to need a lot of mustard
for this frankfurter!

957
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:45,616
The Nobel Peace Prize
in Inventing Stuff goes to...

958
00:44:46,015 --> 00:44:47,062
um,

959
00:44:47,135 --> 00:44:48,136
Professor...

960
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:52,105
ls that really your name?

961
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:54,383
It's not, like,
some kind of joke?

962
00:44:54,535 --> 00:44:56,424
No. It's not, like, a joke.

963
00:44:56,575 --> 00:44:59,419
Ifs a traditional name
in New Swissland.

964
00:45:00,095 --> 00:45:02,063
Am I pronouncing it right?

965
00:45:02,215 --> 00:45:04,138
Poopypants?

966
00:45:04,255 --> 00:45:07,304
More or less. Except
the emphasis is on the "poop."

967
00:45:08,975 --> 00:45:10,386
Why are you laughing?

968
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:13,465
I've invented a shrinking
and enlarging ray!

969
00:45:13,615 --> 00:45:14,901
I should be famous!

970
00:45:15,055 --> 00:45:18,457
I should be dating models
twice my size...

971
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,583
and doing the talk show circuit!

972
00:45:20,735 --> 00:45:23,136
I should be protecting
baby seals as a cause...

973
00:45:23,335 --> 00:45:25,906
that I say I care about,
but not really!

974
00:45:26,055 --> 00:45:28,137
This guy is too much!

975
00:45:32,455 --> 00:45:33,980
Stop! Stop laughing!

976
00:45:34,135 --> 00:45:35,182
No, stop it!
Okay.

977
00:45:35,575 --> 00:45:37,339
Phew! Oh...

978
00:45:37,455 --> 00:45:39,617
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

979
00:45:39,815 --> 00:45:41,305
Here. Take the award.

980
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,425
It's really fun
to say Poopypants.

981
00:45:46,775 --> 00:45:49,665
You keep your stupid award!
I don't want it anymore.

982
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:51,982
Oh, and one more thing...

983
00:45:56,335 --> 00:45:58,417
On behalf
of the Nobel Prize committee,

984
00:45:58,495 --> 00:46:00,099
please accept our apology.

985
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:02,986
And could you change me
back now please?

986
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,311
Why don't you go on and invent

987
00:46:04,335 --> 00:46:06,019
your own shrinking
and enlarging ray...

988
00:46:06,215 --> 00:46:08,456
if you think you're so smart?

989
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:15,662
How much of that was out loud?

990
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,341
Extra! Extra!
Get our latest issue!

991
00:46:18,495 --> 00:46:21,339
<i>Captain Underpants
and the Perilous Plot</i>

992
00:46:21,455 --> 00:46:23,457
<i>of Professor Poopypants.</i>

993
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:25,185
Oh, no.

994
00:46:26,695 --> 00:46:29,221
There you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

995
00:46:29,855 --> 00:46:32,381
Hmm. How many A's
are there in "Tra-la-laaa?"

996
00:46:32,575 --> 00:46:34,543
What?
<i>I'll</i> just go with 11.

997
00:46:34,695 --> 00:46:36,663
Enjoying your
first day, professor?

998
00:46:36,815 --> 00:46:38,704
The complete opposite, actually.

999
00:46:38,855 --> 00:46:41,176
Look at what these
little monsters have created!

1000
00:46:41,895 --> 00:46:45,866
We must lock them up,
probably, like, forever!

1001
00:46:46,055 --> 00:46:47,056
Hmm.

1002
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:49,340
Oh, my.

1003
00:46:49,495 --> 00:46:50,826
This is not a comic.

1004
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,503
This is a history book.

1005
00:46:53,575 --> 00:46:54,701
What?

1006
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:57,022
And as such, it should be
taught in every classroom.

1007
00:46:57,175 --> 00:46:58,540
And you yourself
must teach it...

1008
00:46:58,695 --> 00:47:01,744
because that is how good it is.

1009
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:03,335
I don't understand.
I thought, like,

1010
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:05,059
we'd be on the same page here.

1011
00:47:05,855 --> 00:47:08,062
What page is that?
I'm on page 9, here.

1012
00:47:08,215 --> 00:47:09,216
It's fantastic.

1013
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,376
Look, look.

1014
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:11,911
<i>It's about
this evil science teacher...</i>

1015
00:47:11,935 --> 00:47:13,937
<i>who looks a lot like you,
by the way.</i>

1016
00:47:14,095 --> 00:47:16,223
<i>And he wanted to
rid the world of laughter...</i>

1017
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,935
<i>but he couldn't figure out
how to do It.</i>

1018
00:47:18,615 --> 00:47:20,822
<i>Even worse, I! seemed like
everywhere he went,</i>

1019
00:47:20,895 --> 00:47:22,863
<i>people were having fun
and laughing.</i>

1020
00:47:23,575 --> 00:47:25,577
<i>It just was infuriating.</i>

1021
00:47:25,935 --> 00:47:29,098
<i>But then, he discovered
someone who wasn't.</i>

1022
00:47:30,615 --> 00:47:32,026
Why is it funny?

1023
00:47:32,415 --> 00:47:34,782
Anti-Humor Boy!

1024
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:38,543
And then the professor says,
"Very interesting."

1025
00:47:38,975 --> 00:47:40,386
That's my voice for him.

1026
00:47:40,535 --> 00:47:42,458
Wait, wait, wait. Gimme that.

1027
00:47:42,615 --> 00:47:44,743
That's no Anti-Humor Boy.

1028
00:47:44,935 --> 00:47:48,576
That's the suck up from class.

1029
00:47:49,415 --> 00:47:51,417
Very interesting.

1030
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:54,783
You boys
don't even realize it...

1031
00:47:54,935 --> 00:47:57,666
but your silly comic book
just helped me figure out...

1032
00:47:57,815 --> 00:48:00,944
how to wipe out laughter
on the... Oof!

1033
00:48:01,135 --> 00:48:02,500
Out of the road, bozo!

1034
00:48:02,655 --> 00:48:03,861
Hey, watch where you're going!

1035
00:48:03,935 --> 00:48:05,619
You just hit
Professor Poopypants.

1036
00:48:05,775 --> 00:48:07,425
Poopypants?

1037
00:48:07,495 --> 00:48:09,099
That's not funny!
That's not funny!

1038
00:48:09,295 --> 00:48:11,059
Ever heard of the sidewalk?

1039
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:14,418
Oh, if I had insurance,
you'd be in... Ow!

1040
00:48:15,095 --> 00:48:17,302
I'll admit that was surprising.

1041
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:18,496
Wow.

1042
00:48:18,575 --> 00:48:20,623
That actually
worked out for once.

1043
00:48:20,775 --> 00:48:22,300
Good job, Captain Underpants.

1044
00:48:22,455 --> 00:48:24,139
At your service, sidekicks.

1045
00:48:24,295 --> 00:48:25,899
Now where was I?

1046
00:48:25,975 --> 00:48:28,296
We should probably
get back to class, huh?

1047
00:48:28,455 --> 00:48:30,298
Yeah, we probably should.

1048
00:48:32,655 --> 00:48:33,751
Excuse me. Pardon me.
If you could just...

1049
00:48:33,775 --> 00:48:34,815
Watch your feet.
Excuse me.

1050
00:48:34,855 --> 00:48:36,266
Sorry. Thank you.
Oh, hey, Todd.

1051
00:48:36,615 --> 00:48:38,265
Now, let me ask you something.

1052
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,656
If you could
control your principal...

1053
00:48:40,815 --> 00:48:41,816
what would you do?

1054
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:44,706
Shh.
It's starting. It's starting.

1055
00:49:35,855 --> 00:49:37,191
I just wanna make sure you apply

1056
00:49:37,215 --> 00:49:38,865
the extra credit
to next semester.

1057
00:49:39,055 --> 00:49:41,217
I won't be needing it
this semester, of course.

1058
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,376
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah.

1059
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:43,751
Whatever floats
your boat, Melvin.

1060
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:44,981
Excuse me?

1061
00:49:45,135 --> 00:49:46,819
Can I please get
an ice cream sandwich?

1062
00:49:47,015 --> 00:49:50,462
Yeah, scram, okay?
We're closed for Ebola.

1063
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:54,464
Okay, just a quick check

1064
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:56,139
to make sure
that we're connected.

1065
00:49:56,295 --> 00:49:58,138
Mmm-hmm. Okay.
We're sure that's safe?

1066
00:50:02,055 --> 00:50:04,899
<i>And now,
some classic funny bloopers!</i>

1067
00:50:07,055 --> 00:50:09,342
Ah. That's a good one.
Oh, this one's my favorite.

1068
00:50:09,975 --> 00:50:12,023
I'm sorry.
Why are you showing me this?

1069
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:13,341
Ow.

1070
00:50:14,415 --> 00:50:15,746
Come on, that was funny!

1071
00:50:15,815 --> 00:50:17,977
That child walked
right into that rake.

1072
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,066
I'm bored! What else is on?

1073
00:50:21,215 --> 00:50:24,856
Fascinating.
Computer, scan.

1074
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,706
I don't believe it.

1075
00:50:27,895 --> 00:50:28,895
You know, I suspected

1076
00:50:28,935 --> 00:50:31,381
something smaller than normal,
but this...

1077
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:33,698
This.
What? What is it?

1078
00:50:33,895 --> 00:50:37,104
I can't find it.
Your Hahaguffawchuckleamalus!

1079
00:50:37,415 --> 00:50:38,576
You don't have one!

1080
00:50:41,615 --> 00:50:43,219
I don't get it.
Exactly.

1081
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:47,778
You have no sense of humor
like a chair or a supermodel.

1082
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,576
Melvin, with your brain
and my brain together...

1083
00:50:51,735 --> 00:50:54,102
we can finally wipe out laughter

1084
00:50:54,175 --> 00:50:56,382
for once and for all!

1085
00:50:57,615 --> 00:51:01,097
So George and Harold
want a supervillain...

1086
00:51:01,455 --> 00:51:05,619
well, ask and ye shall receive!

1087
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:09,059
I hereby declare...

1088
00:51:09,215 --> 00:51:11,297
the Jerome Horwitz
art program...

1089
00:51:12,815 --> 00:51:14,465
reinstated!

1090
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,656
Oh...

1091
00:51:19,735 --> 00:51:20,975
After you, sir.

1092
00:51:34,815 --> 00:51:36,499
Ooh, what if we...
I'm already on it.

1093
00:51:36,655 --> 00:51:38,145
Oh, this is gonna be epic!

1094
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,898
Come on, Captain, draw!

1095
00:51:41,975 --> 00:51:44,182
Move your hand
in the shape of a person!

1096
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:46,144
Why does it look like a chicken?

1097
00:51:46,295 --> 00:51:48,423
This whole visual
storytelling thing is hard!

1098
00:51:48,495 --> 00:51:49,496
Oh, that's good.

1099
00:51:49,575 --> 00:51:51,020
Here, these need words.

1100
00:51:51,335 --> 00:51:52,496
Hey, sidekicks...

1101
00:51:53,135 --> 00:51:54,500
why are we doing this again?

1102
00:51:54,655 --> 00:51:56,862
Well, we're making
school fun again.

1103
00:51:57,015 --> 00:51:59,177
You know, "free the children."

1104
00:51:59,335 --> 00:52:01,151
Hey, hey! What if we put
this panel right here?

1105
00:52:01,175 --> 00:52:02,176
Oh, yes! Yes, yes.

1106
00:52:02,295 --> 00:52:04,024
Ah, yes. Of course.

1107
00:52:04,335 --> 00:52:05,336
Fun.

1108
00:52:05,495 --> 00:52:06,542
On it!

1109
00:52:06,615 --> 00:52:07,616
Ha-ha!

1110
00:52:14,455 --> 00:52:15,456
Uh...

1111
00:52:15,655 --> 00:52:17,020
Where'd everybody go?

1112
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:25,017
Where did this even come from?

1113
00:52:25,135 --> 00:52:26,136
Hey!

1114
00:52:26,215 --> 00:52:27,775
Oh, hey, sidekicks.
Glad you could join.

1115
00:52:27,855 --> 00:52:29,061
How did you even do this?

1116
00:52:29,135 --> 00:52:30,671
I thought you said
you were looking after the...

1117
00:52:30,695 --> 00:52:32,151
Oh, my goodness!
Is that a Ferris wheel?

1118
00:52:32,175 --> 00:52:33,540
Well, of course it is!

1119
00:52:33,615 --> 00:52:35,697
It came
with the carnival I ordered.

1120
00:52:37,175 --> 00:52:39,826
This cotton candy
makes me feel powerful!

1121
00:52:41,815 --> 00:52:43,340
Hey, uh,
where are all the teachers?

1122
00:52:43,495 --> 00:52:44,542
Detention.

1123
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:47,022
They have a real
attitude problem.

1124
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:49,218
Sure beats having Krupp around!

1125
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,697
Oh, yeah. Krupp would totally
lose his mind if he saw this.

1126
00:52:52,855 --> 00:52:54,380
Step right up!

1127
00:52:54,535 --> 00:52:56,981
Who'll be the first
to dunk the principal?

1128
00:52:57,055 --> 00:52:58,055
No!

1129
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,825
I'm drowning!

1130
00:53:02,415 --> 00:53:03,416
Tra-la...

1131
00:53:03,495 --> 00:53:05,031
All right, that's enough.
Recess is over.

1132
00:53:05,055 --> 00:53:06,102
Ah, come on!

1133
00:53:06,215 --> 00:53:07,216
Just one more ride!
Whoa!

1134
00:53:08,095 --> 00:53:09,904
Hey, watch it!
What is this, a carnival?

1135
00:53:10,055 --> 00:53:11,659
I hate carnivals!

1136
00:53:11,815 --> 00:53:13,943
Oh, this looks fun!
How do we play?

1137
00:53:15,015 --> 00:53:16,426
Hold your fire!

1138
00:53:17,935 --> 00:53:18,936
What is happening?

1139
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:20,096
Who wants ice cream?

1140
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,586
Ice cream!

1141
00:53:21,775 --> 00:53:23,815
What are we gonna do?
We can't keep this up forever.

1142
00:53:23,855 --> 00:53:25,857
We have to! We'll just
take shifts watching him.

1143
00:53:26,015 --> 00:53:27,346
I'll take today.
You take tonight.

1144
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,735
Sugar!

1145
00:53:30,935 --> 00:53:31,936
Sugar!

1146
00:53:33,935 --> 00:53:35,937
Harold, I really
want some sugar.

1147
00:53:36,095 --> 00:53:37,381
Me too.

1148
00:53:39,095 --> 00:53:40,460
We made the wrong choice!

1149
00:53:40,615 --> 00:53:42,458
This did not solve anything!

1150
00:53:42,615 --> 00:53:43,975
Hey, sidekicks!

1151
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:45,945
Check this out!

1152
00:53:46,855 --> 00:53:48,744
Geronimo!

1153
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:49,896
No!

1154
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:55,140
This way!

1155
00:53:55,295 --> 00:53:57,138
Field trip, anyone?

1156
00:53:59,095 --> 00:54:00,221
No, no, no!

1157
00:54:00,935 --> 00:54:03,302
Nothing's more fun than fire!

1158
00:54:03,455 --> 00:54:04,980
Except being on...

1159
00:54:06,295 --> 00:54:07,660
Fire!

1160
00:54:10,215 --> 00:54:11,296
What is happening?

1161
00:54:12,655 --> 00:54:14,498
Tra-la-laaaa!

1162
00:54:19,975 --> 00:54:22,342
Now, this is
how you run a school!

1163
00:54:24,935 --> 00:54:26,824
Free the children!

1164
00:54:29,615 --> 00:54:30,616
Wait a minute.

1165
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:34,816
What the...

1166
00:54:36,655 --> 00:54:37,816
How did this...

1167
00:54:40,655 --> 00:54:42,145
I don't understand.

1168
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:44,185
Help!
What the...

1169
00:54:46,415 --> 00:54:47,701
You...

1170
00:54:48,415 --> 00:54:50,179
You two.

1171
00:54:51,495 --> 00:54:53,179
Your friendship...

1172
00:54:53,935 --> 00:54:57,826
is no more.

1173
00:55:40,055 --> 00:55:41,056
What?

1174
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:47,376
George!

1175
00:55:47,695 --> 00:55:48,742
Harold!

1176
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,416
Harold! Come back!

1177
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:55,738
George, I'm right here!
I'm right here!

1178
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:59,217
Oh, no! No, no!
Don't leave me!

1179
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:01,537
I won't! I won't, George!

1180
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:02,695
Harold!

1181
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:04,260
No, no! Wait, wait! Stop!

1182
00:56:04,415 --> 00:56:06,065
George!

1183
00:56:06,215 --> 00:56:08,058
George!

1184
00:56:29,295 --> 00:56:32,060
This thing is amazing,
Professor P.

1185
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,302
You could probably solve

1186
00:56:33,415 --> 00:56:35,015
world hunger
with an invention like this.

1187
00:56:35,135 --> 00:56:37,866
Pass!
More importantly...

1188
00:56:38,135 --> 00:56:39,739
how do I look?

1189
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:42,626
Just like you do in this comic!

1190
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:44,777
Good! Now,
hands off the merchandise,

1191
00:56:44,895 --> 00:56:46,818
and go fetch
your little toilet, okay?

1192
00:56:48,135 --> 00:56:49,899
I call it "The Turbo..."

1193
00:56:50,055 --> 00:56:52,422
Yeah, yeah. Couple of
gold stars for you, kiddo.

1194
00:56:52,975 --> 00:56:56,980
Let the Poopageddon begin!

1195
00:56:59,935 --> 00:57:01,824
Whoo-ee!

1196
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:09,145
What?
Oh, you've gotta be joking me!

1197
00:57:09,495 --> 00:57:13,580
Poopypants has no gas!
You can't write this stuff.

1198
00:57:14,575 --> 00:57:16,100
Where would a burgeoning villain

1199
00:57:16,175 --> 00:57:17,779
find unlimited power?

1200
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:20,666
True power comes from within.

1201
00:57:20,815 --> 00:57:22,146
No, it doesn't, Melvin!

1202
00:57:22,295 --> 00:57:23,295
That's on stupid posters!

1203
00:57:23,335 --> 00:57:24,336
Okay.

1204
00:57:24,455 --> 00:57:26,503
It comes
from enormous energy sources!

1205
00:57:26,615 --> 00:57:27,855
A nuclear waste dump.

1206
00:57:28,015 --> 00:57:29,016
I see where you're going.

1207
00:57:29,095 --> 00:57:30,665
A poisonous chemical factory.

1208
00:57:30,855 --> 00:57:34,462
Or perhaps
a place even more toxic!

1209
00:57:37,775 --> 00:57:39,140
Whoo!
These leftovers got a kick.

1210
00:57:41,695 --> 00:57:43,982
Oh, it's a powerful smell.

1211
00:57:51,855 --> 00:57:54,506
Back in business, baby!

1212
00:57:55,015 --> 00:57:57,700
Memorize these elements...

1213
00:57:57,855 --> 00:57:59,983
Oxygen. Beryllium.

1214
00:58:00,175 --> 00:58:02,018
Boringillium.

1215
00:58:02,175 --> 00:58:03,700
Lameium.

1216
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,141
Snoronium.

1217
00:58:15,455 --> 00:58:17,503
Excuse me, everybody,
there's a giant...

1218
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:19,191
Do not interrupt
while I'm reading

1219
00:58:19,215 --> 00:58:20,865
monotone from my textbook!

1220
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:23,063
But the toilet!

1221
00:58:23,215 --> 00:58:24,216
Ugh.

1222
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,184
Just go.

1223
00:58:27,575 --> 00:58:28,576
Harold?

1224
00:58:29,415 --> 00:58:30,416
George?

1225
00:58:49,575 --> 00:58:51,418
Students and faculty

1226
00:58:51,535 --> 00:58:54,539
<i>of Jerome Horwitz Elementary...</i>

1227
00:58:54,935 --> 00:59:00,101
<i>the world, as you know it,
is about to go extinct.</i>

1228
00:59:00,255 --> 00:59:04,021
And a new world order
is about to rise!

1229
00:59:04,175 --> 00:59:05,700
One that is, you know, honestly

1230
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:07,459
pretty similar
to the old world order...

1231
00:59:07,615 --> 00:59:10,937
except for one tiny detail...

1232
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,456
Melvin?

1233
00:59:14,615 --> 00:59:16,265
Comin' atcha!

1234
00:59:16,415 --> 00:59:18,782
Powered by
Melvin's unique neurology...

1235
00:59:18,935 --> 00:59:23,099
I will successfully disable
the Hahaguffawchuckleamalus...

1236
00:59:23,255 --> 00:59:27,260
of every single child at
Jerome Horwitz Elementary.

1237
00:59:27,415 --> 00:59:31,136
<i>For I, Professor Poopypants...</i>

1238
00:59:32,975 --> 00:59:34,579
Yeah, it's a funny name.

1239
00:59:35,455 --> 00:59:38,618
It just makes you
laugh and laugh, right?

1240
00:59:41,295 --> 00:59:42,296
Get down!

1241
00:59:45,735 --> 00:59:47,817
Still give you the chuckles now?

1242
00:59:47,935 --> 00:59:49,380
Poopypants!

1243
00:59:49,575 --> 00:59:50,986
I don't get it.

1244
00:59:51,135 --> 00:59:52,216
Why is that funny?

1245
00:59:52,415 --> 00:59:53,416
Perfect!

1246
00:59:53,575 --> 00:59:56,499
Finally!
You're speaking my language!

1247
00:59:56,655 --> 00:59:58,100
Oh, no. This is bad.

1248
00:59:58,295 --> 00:59:59,421
This is seriously bad.

1249
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:01,577
I mean,
a world without laughter?

1250
01:00:01,735 --> 01:00:03,375
George, if he destroys
our sense of humor,

1251
01:00:03,415 --> 01:00:04,496
he destroys us!

1252
01:00:04,655 --> 01:00:07,340
Imagine how boring
our comics will be.

1253
01:00:08,135 --> 01:00:09,944
<i>Captain Underpants
and the Purchase</i>

1254
01:00:10,015 --> 01:00:11,585
<i>of the Sensible Beige Pants.</i>

1255
01:00:11,735 --> 01:00:15,979
<i>Captain Underpants
Eats All of His Falafel.</i>

1256
01:00:16,135 --> 01:00:18,661
<i>Captain Underpants
Watches Cement Dry.</i>

1257
01:00:21,255 --> 01:00:22,671
And would the creators of

1258
01:00:22,695 --> 01:00:25,824
this absolutely
hilarious comic book...

1259
01:00:25,975 --> 01:00:29,184
please come out, come out,
wherever you are!

1260
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:31,019
You're next.

1261
01:00:35,495 --> 01:00:37,179
Okay, we have to stop him.

1262
01:00:37,535 --> 01:00:39,185
We've gotta find a way
to unplug Melvin.

1263
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:40,376
Yeah.

1264
01:00:40,695 --> 01:00:43,221
But how do we get to him
without Poopypants seeing us?

1265
01:00:45,455 --> 01:00:47,457
What are you two doing together?

1266
01:00:50,695 --> 01:00:52,299
Are you in there?

1267
01:00:52,495 --> 01:00:54,975
Oh...
Maybe you're hiding here.

1268
01:00:57,575 --> 01:00:59,623
Oh, sorry.
Are you stuck on hold?

1269
01:00:59,735 --> 01:01:00,736
Mmm-hmm.

1270
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,217
Oh, totally hate
when that happens.

1271
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:04,536
Well, good luck with that.

1272
01:01:04,735 --> 01:01:06,464
Now, where are
those two little...

1273
01:01:06,655 --> 01:01:08,737
Stand down, Poopypants!

1274
01:01:08,895 --> 01:01:10,056
What is happening?

1275
01:01:10,215 --> 01:01:11,740
I hope this works.

1276
01:01:11,895 --> 01:01:13,420
Tra-la-laaa!

1277
01:01:13,535 --> 01:01:14,661
Ow! Ow!

1278
01:01:16,015 --> 01:01:17,831
Keep standing down.
I'm just gonna be a second.

1279
01:01:17,855 --> 01:01:19,220
Ow.

1280
01:01:19,815 --> 01:01:21,817
I bet he thought
that was going to be cooler.

1281
01:01:21,975 --> 01:01:23,739
Oh, boy. Here goes nothing.

1282
01:01:23,855 --> 01:01:25,016
Ha-ha!

1283
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:26,740
Prepare to be vanquished...

1284
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:28,260
and justice to be served

1285
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:31,026
on a piping hot
platter of freedom!

1286
01:01:31,175 --> 01:01:32,745
With a side order of liberty...

1287
01:01:32,895 --> 01:01:36,616
and a super-sized cup
filled with freedom also!

1288
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:39,261
Impressive use
of fast-food analogies,

1289
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:41,582
you giant baby with a cape on!

1290
01:01:41,775 --> 01:01:43,106
Let's do this.

1291
01:02:02,255 --> 01:02:04,257
Freeze! The following sequence
contains scenes...

1292
01:02:04,415 --> 01:02:05,751
that are so intense,
horrific, and violent...

1293
01:02:05,775 --> 01:02:06,776
And expensive.

1294
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:09,111
That we can only show it
using a technology known as...

1295
01:02:09,135 --> 01:02:11,263
<i>Flip-O-Rama!</i>

1296
01:02:11,415 --> 01:02:12,541
<i>Take it away, Harold.</i>

1297
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,191
Okay, first Professor Poopypants

1298
01:02:14,215 --> 01:02:15,391
gave Captain Underpants
the boot.

1299
01:02:15,415 --> 01:02:16,701
Foot! Foot! Ow!

1300
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:18,511
Then he made
an Underpants sandwich.

1301
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:19,871
Punch, punch! Punch, punch!

1302
01:02:19,895 --> 01:02:22,111
And then, they played
a friendly game of paddleball!

1303
01:02:22,135 --> 01:02:23,899
Oh, no!

1304
01:02:24,055 --> 01:02:25,056
Darn.

1305
01:02:25,135 --> 01:02:27,058
Okay, what's next?
Oh, yes!

1306
01:02:27,215 --> 01:02:30,059
Then, Poopypants summoned
an army of dolphins...

1307
01:02:30,215 --> 01:02:31,271
Wait, what?
Why are you always

1308
01:02:31,295 --> 01:02:32,551
sneaking dolphins
into the movie?

1309
01:02:32,575 --> 01:02:33,871
What do you have
against dolphins anyway?

1310
01:02:33,895 --> 01:02:35,191
I don't have nothing
against dolphins,

1311
01:02:35,215 --> 01:02:36,951
- it just didn't happen!
- Well, so what'?

1312
01:02:36,975 --> 01:02:39,626
We get to say what happened.
It's the Flip-O-Rama.

1313
01:02:39,775 --> 01:02:41,777
I like dolphins.
The dolphins are in.

1314
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:43,871
Fine, all right.
Let's just keep going.

1315
01:02:43,895 --> 01:02:45,031
- You sure?
- Yep, positive.

1316
01:02:45,055 --> 01:02:46,055
Thank you.

1317
01:02:46,135 --> 01:02:48,471
- Anyway, Poopypants didn't realize it...
- Quiet five, quiet five.

1318
01:02:48,495 --> 01:02:50,782
But George and Harold's plan
was working out perfectly.

1319
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:52,871
So, they
shot themselves to the top

1320
01:02:52,895 --> 01:02:54,340
of the Turbo Toilet 2000!

1321
01:02:54,495 --> 01:02:56,816
To keep things dramatic,
they didn't quite make it.

1322
01:02:57,015 --> 01:02:58,744
And then...
And then...

1323
01:02:58,975 --> 01:02:59,975
And then...

1324
01:03:00,015 --> 01:03:01,585
What happened
to the Flip-O-Rama?

1325
01:03:01,735 --> 01:03:02,861
I ran outta paper.

1326
01:03:06,735 --> 01:03:08,703
Hey, Melvin!
Take that thing off your head.

1327
01:03:08,855 --> 01:03:09,856
We gotta stop Poopypants!

1328
01:03:10,175 --> 01:03:11,700
Professor Poopypants!

1329
01:03:11,775 --> 01:03:14,016
George and Harold
are trying to stop you!

1330
01:03:15,335 --> 01:03:17,099
You are just so annoying!

1331
01:03:18,335 --> 01:03:21,259
So, you two
little numbskulls thought

1332
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:22,456
you could distract me...

1333
01:03:22,615 --> 01:03:25,698
with this idiotic, naked man.
Am I right?

1334
01:03:25,855 --> 01:03:27,823
I'm not naked!

1335
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:32,185
Any final words before this
whole revenge thing goes down?

1336
01:03:34,055 --> 01:03:35,500
Yeah, wait, wait. Listen.

1337
01:03:35,655 --> 01:03:38,056
We apologize
for making fun of your name.

1338
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:40,536
I mean, that was just wrong.

1339
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:44,541
Yeah, we're sorry.
The truth is. Professor P...

1340
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,060
you have probably, like,

1341
01:03:46,135 --> 01:03:47,978
the greatest name
we've ever heard.

1342
01:03:48,535 --> 01:03:50,503
I mean, George, imagine
if we had names like that.

1343
01:03:50,695 --> 01:03:52,299
Oh, that would be so cool!

1344
01:03:52,455 --> 01:03:54,059
Okay, wait, let's do it.
Let's try it.

1345
01:03:54,495 --> 01:03:56,896
Oh, I would be
Fluffy Toiletnose.

1346
01:03:57,055 --> 01:04:00,855
Yeah! I would be
Sir Cheeseball Wafflefanny.

1347
01:04:01,015 --> 01:04:02,191
Yeah, sure. You're a knight.

1348
01:04:02,215 --> 01:04:03,216
This is so good!

1349
01:04:03,735 --> 01:04:04,736
I wanna change mine.

1350
01:04:04,895 --> 01:04:07,262
I'd be
Buttcheeks von Stinkelsberg.

1351
01:04:09,415 --> 01:04:10,655
Stinkelsberg.

1352
01:04:11,255 --> 01:04:13,656
Yeah, those are all
really silly names,

1353
01:04:13,735 --> 01:04:15,055
but there's
nothing funny about...

1354
01:04:15,095 --> 01:04:17,826
Professor
Pee-Pee Diarrheastein

1355
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:20,341
Poopypants Esquire!

1356
01:04:21,055 --> 01:04:24,741
Sir, are you saying
your full name is...

1357
01:04:24,935 --> 01:04:28,781
Pee-Pee Diarrheastein
Poopypants Esquire?

1358
01:04:28,855 --> 01:04:29,856
Uh-huh.

1359
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:34,380
Stop it! Stop laughing!

1360
01:04:34,535 --> 01:04:36,344
Come on! Listen, your problem

1361
01:04:36,415 --> 01:04:38,065
isn't that people laugh at you.

1362
01:04:38,215 --> 01:04:40,582
Your problem is that
you can't laugh at yourself.

1363
01:04:40,735 --> 01:04:43,261
Oh, really, Oprah?
Is that my problem?

1364
01:04:43,455 --> 01:04:45,583
Well, your problem is this...

1365
01:04:53,455 --> 01:04:54,616
No!

1366
01:04:55,775 --> 01:04:58,301
Oh, I hope
you enjoyed your years

1367
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,457
of laughter and merriment...

1368
01:05:00,615 --> 01:05:04,256
because they're about
to come to an end.

1369
01:05:08,135 --> 01:05:10,979
Do you find anything funny
about me now?

1370
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:14,221
You mean, other than your name?

1371
01:05:15,935 --> 01:05:17,937
Yes! Other than that!

1372
01:05:19,135 --> 01:05:21,103
And your hair'?

1373
01:05:21,175 --> 01:05:22,176
What?

1374
01:05:22,255 --> 01:05:23,825
My hair's cool, I thought.

1375
01:05:23,975 --> 01:05:25,659
Are you kidding me?

1376
01:05:25,815 --> 01:05:28,625
That's almost as funny as
my hair back in kindygarten!

1377
01:05:28,775 --> 01:05:30,345
Remember that afro?

1378
01:05:31,575 --> 01:05:33,577
No!
No, this can't be happening!

1379
01:05:33,655 --> 01:05:35,657
Computer, activate brain scan.

1380
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:41,100
Let's see. The frontal lobes
look big and healthy.

1381
01:05:41,255 --> 01:05:43,019
The Hahaguffawchuckleamalus

1382
01:05:43,095 --> 01:05:45,826
looks all shrimpy,
so, what gives?

1383
01:05:48,495 --> 01:05:49,496
It can't be!

1384
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:51,783
Their Hahaguffawchuckleamaluses,

1385
01:05:51,855 --> 01:05:53,345
they're enormous!

1386
01:05:53,855 --> 01:05:54,981
I need more power.

1387
01:05:58,695 --> 01:06:00,936
Anything strike you
as funny now?

1388
01:06:01,095 --> 01:06:04,542
I'm sure
we can think of something!

1389
01:06:04,695 --> 01:06:08,017
George, I can't smile anymore.

1390
01:06:08,175 --> 01:06:09,825
No! Harold!

1391
01:06:13,855 --> 01:06:16,938
<i>One down, undone to go.</i>

1392
01:06:17,935 --> 01:06:19,141
Harold.

1393
01:06:24,775 --> 01:06:27,016
Harold. Harold,
can you hear me?

1394
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:29,059
Harold!

1395
01:06:29,895 --> 01:06:31,545
George! George, is that you?

1396
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:32,696
Right here, buddy.

1397
01:06:33,335 --> 01:06:35,144
What's happening?
We're shrinking!

1398
01:06:35,295 --> 01:06:36,711
Now, if we don't laugh
at something soon,

1399
01:06:36,735 --> 01:06:37,896
we may never laugh again.

1400
01:06:38,055 --> 01:06:40,183
Oh, no! What do we do?
What do we do? What do we do?

1401
01:06:40,335 --> 01:06:42,383
Well, we have to think
of something funny, okay?

1402
01:06:42,575 --> 01:06:44,498
Okay, yeah, sure.
Something funny.

1403
01:06:45,895 --> 01:06:46,896
Anything?

1404
01:06:46,975 --> 01:06:48,306
No, I got nothing.
Me neither.

1405
01:06:48,495 --> 01:06:49,615
More shrinkage!

1406
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:52,581
Okay, okay.
What did we use to find funny?

1407
01:06:52,735 --> 01:06:54,863
Mostly potty humor. Poop,
vomit, that kind of thing.

1408
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:58,861
Really? Ugh. That is, like,
the lowest form of comedy.

1409
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,825
Don't you say that, Harold!
Don't you leave me!

1410
01:07:02,695 --> 01:07:04,151
Attention everyone!

1411
01:07:04,175 --> 01:07:07,099
<i>Poopypants here with a little
update on the Poopageddon.</i>

1412
01:07:07,255 --> 01:07:10,577
<i>Due to the success
of my plan thus far...</i>

1413
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,578
<i>We decided to wipe out laughter</i>

1414
01:07:12,655 --> 01:07:14,419
<i>on the entire planet.</i>

1415
01:07:14,575 --> 01:07:16,339
<i>After that, you know,
I'll probably</i>

1416
01:07:16,415 --> 01:07:17,495
<i>move on to other planets...</i>

1417
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:18,576
<i>Jupiter, Mars...</i>

1418
01:07:18,775 --> 01:07:20,504
can't forget Uranus!

1419
01:07:21,335 --> 01:07:23,099
Wait. Did he just say...

1420
01:07:24,095 --> 01:07:26,097
Your anus.

1421
01:07:26,255 --> 01:07:27,256
I know!

1422
01:07:35,535 --> 01:07:36,536
Uranus!

1423
01:07:37,455 --> 01:07:40,425
Yeah, and once I'm through
with the gas giants...

1424
01:07:40,575 --> 01:07:42,543
I figure I'll go
after the other galaxies...

1425
01:07:42,695 --> 01:07:43,742
What?

1426
01:07:44,735 --> 01:07:47,545
It feels so good to laugh!

1427
01:07:50,575 --> 01:07:54,819
No, stop it! Stop laughing!
You're ruining everything!

1428
01:07:54,975 --> 01:07:57,546
Yikes!
Extra credit or survival?

1429
01:07:57,735 --> 01:07:59,146
Extra credit or survival?

1430
01:07:59,295 --> 01:08:01,138
I choose survival!

1431
01:08:12,815 --> 01:08:13,816
Uh-oh!

1432
01:08:31,655 --> 01:08:32,816
Oh, yeah!

1433
01:08:33,855 --> 01:08:34,856
Wow!

1434
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,138
No, how could this be happening?

1435
01:08:41,295 --> 01:08:42,342
Never underestimate

1436
01:08:42,415 --> 01:08:44,497
the power of laughter,
Poopypants!

1437
01:08:44,695 --> 01:08:46,777
Oh, that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1438
01:08:46,855 --> 01:08:47,856
Oh!

1439
01:08:49,695 --> 01:08:51,140
Ah! Whoa!

1440
01:09:04,455 --> 01:09:06,537
Harold! Harold, we did it!

1441
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:08,376
Harold?

1442
01:09:08,655 --> 01:09:09,941
I think I bruised a rib.

1443
01:09:10,135 --> 01:09:11,978
Because I've never laughed
so hard in my life!

1444
01:09:16,095 --> 01:09:18,985
Oh, we'll see who's laughing
once I shrink you down...

1445
01:09:19,135 --> 01:09:21,183
where you will live
in my pocket forever...

1446
01:09:21,335 --> 01:09:23,576
amongst my
cherry-flavored lip balm...

1447
01:09:23,775 --> 01:09:25,698
my butterscotch-flavored
lip balm...

1448
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:26,776
Oh, neato!

1449
01:09:26,855 --> 01:09:28,698
My mint-flavored
lip balm...

1450
01:09:28,855 --> 01:09:32,018
my extra-moisturized
SPF lip balm...

1451
01:09:32,175 --> 01:09:34,906
and all of my lip balms!

1452
01:09:37,775 --> 01:09:39,539
Why does one person have
so much lip balm?

1453
01:09:39,695 --> 01:09:40,696
Help!
Help!

1454
01:09:40,815 --> 01:09:42,658
Please, anyone! Help!

1455
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:44,426
Help!

1456
01:09:52,695 --> 01:09:54,618
Ooh, I hope you can find
tiny enough pens...

1457
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:56,857
to make your small,
little comic books with...

1458
01:09:57,015 --> 01:09:59,017
'cause you're about to
get smallified!

1459
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,863
Tra-la-laa!

1460
01:10:11,015 --> 01:10:12,619
I feel...

1461
01:10:13,495 --> 01:10:14,656
awesome!

1462
01:10:14,815 --> 01:10:15,862
No way!

1463
01:10:15,935 --> 01:10:17,425
He has real superpowers!

1464
01:10:17,615 --> 01:10:20,459
Oh, that is an obvious twist
that I did not see coming...

1465
01:10:20,615 --> 01:10:22,583
despite my many years
of comic book studies!

1466
01:10:22,735 --> 01:10:25,420
I have come to save the day!

1467
01:10:25,575 --> 01:10:26,736
Yay!

1468
01:10:26,895 --> 01:10:28,306
Yeah, and I've come to ruin it!

1469
01:10:28,455 --> 01:10:29,735
So back off, buddy!

1470
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:33,496
Ha-ha!

1471
01:10:33,655 --> 01:10:34,986
Ew, that's gross!

1472
01:10:35,135 --> 01:10:36,705
Oh, there's more
where that came from.

1473
01:10:36,895 --> 01:10:39,466
Monday! Tuesday!
Wednesday! Thursday!

1474
01:10:39,975 --> 01:10:41,340
Ha-ha! Unlimited underpants!

1475
01:10:41,495 --> 01:10:44,385
I am so glad that we gave him
that superpower!

1476
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:48,015
My Sizerator!

1477
01:10:48,335 --> 01:10:50,906
Well, it's mine now!

1478
01:10:51,215 --> 01:10:53,138
Alas!

1479
01:10:53,295 --> 01:10:57,459
The final failure
for Professor Poopypants.

1480
01:10:57,695 --> 01:10:59,140
Hmm. What does this button do?

1481
01:11:01,255 --> 01:11:03,223
Oh...

1482
01:11:03,335 --> 01:11:05,383
Well, hello down there!

1483
01:11:05,535 --> 01:11:06,536
No!

1484
01:11:06,655 --> 01:11:07,815
Must be holding it backwards.

1485
01:11:08,735 --> 01:11:10,066
Yup. That was it.

1486
01:11:10,255 --> 01:11:12,064
Wow. He is super dumb.

1487
01:11:13,615 --> 01:11:14,821
I can't reach.

1488
01:11:15,015 --> 01:11:17,382
Time to take you down
once and for all, Poopypants!

1489
01:11:17,535 --> 01:11:19,185
Buzz off!

1490
01:11:22,095 --> 01:11:23,221
Captain Underpants!

1491
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:25,055
Fly over here
so we can make you big again!

1492
01:11:25,215 --> 01:11:26,296
Crackerjack idea.

1493
01:11:28,175 --> 01:11:29,176
George, just don't...

1494
01:11:29,295 --> 01:11:31,377
No!

1495
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:32,575
Ha-ha!

1496
01:11:32,615 --> 01:11:35,903
Give him a big hand
for that one, everybody!

1497
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,581
Get him.

1498
01:11:40,695 --> 01:11:41,742
Whoops.

1499
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:44,024
Look what I've got.

1500
01:11:44,695 --> 01:11:45,981
A tiny school

1501
01:11:46,055 --> 01:11:47,615
filled with tiny children...

1502
01:11:48,335 --> 01:11:50,542
and their tiny teachers
whose tiny salaries...

1503
01:11:50,695 --> 01:11:52,743
reflect their size and also...

1504
01:11:52,895 --> 01:11:55,705
the value society puts
on education.

1505
01:11:56,335 --> 01:11:57,575
I'll take that!

1506
01:11:57,735 --> 01:11:59,578
Oh! Then I'll take that!

1507
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:01,106
Ow! Did you just slap me?

1508
01:12:01,255 --> 01:12:03,019
Yes, I did.
And you deserved it.

1509
01:12:03,175 --> 01:12:05,826
No, I didn't! Your hand
is huge! That hurt a lot!

1510
01:12:05,975 --> 01:12:07,136
Give it back, it's mine!

1511
01:12:07,295 --> 01:12:08,376
No! Hands off!

1512
01:12:08,535 --> 01:12:10,219
No fair! No backsies!
Give it to me!

1513
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:11,661
Would you just give me that?

1514
01:12:11,855 --> 01:12:13,345
Now look what you've done!

1515
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,496
Give it!

1516
01:12:23,855 --> 01:12:25,425
George!

1517
01:12:32,055 --> 01:12:33,056
Gotcha!

1518
01:12:34,775 --> 01:12:36,379
Yeah, that's more like it!

1519
01:12:37,935 --> 01:12:39,141
Nice work, sidekicks!

1520
01:12:39,215 --> 01:12:40,944
I'll just put this back down
right here.

1521
01:12:41,095 --> 01:12:42,375
No, no, no!
Captain Underpants...

1522
01:12:43,535 --> 01:12:45,378
There we go. Back to normal...

1523
01:12:45,535 --> 01:12:46,946
like it never happened.

1524
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:50,264
Oh, no, where'd he go?

1525
01:12:50,415 --> 01:12:51,985
You'll never catch me!

1526
01:12:52,135 --> 01:12:54,297
You can't stop
Professor Poopypants!

1527
01:12:54,895 --> 01:12:56,340
Get back here!
I can't reach!

1528
01:12:56,495 --> 01:12:57,895
Get him, Captain Underpants!

1529
01:12:57,935 --> 01:12:59,937
A bee!
Get away from me!

1530
01:13:00,095 --> 01:13:02,223
I'm free!

1531
01:13:05,055 --> 01:13:06,615
What? What the...
Why would you do that?

1532
01:13:06,735 --> 01:13:08,499
You just let
the bad guy get away!

1533
01:13:08,655 --> 01:13:11,864
Come on, guys. Pretty sure
the bee wasn't the bad guy.

1534
01:13:15,535 --> 01:13:18,266
What the heck happened here?

1535
01:13:18,615 --> 01:13:20,535
You're welcome, peace keeper!

1536
01:13:20,655 --> 01:13:22,145
Would you keep it down?

1537
01:13:31,175 --> 01:13:34,896
Did not see that coming!
Take that, Doctor Diaper!

1538
01:13:38,575 --> 01:13:40,100
I can't believe we made him.

1539
01:13:40,255 --> 01:13:42,337
And he's even dumber
in real life.

1540
01:13:43,015 --> 01:13:45,416
Oh! Look! Little dolphins!

1541
01:13:49,615 --> 01:13:51,424
We have to get rid of him,
don't we?

1542
01:13:51,575 --> 01:13:52,986
I think we do.

1543
01:13:53,135 --> 01:13:54,466
I mean,
he's a way bigger problem

1544
01:13:54,535 --> 01:13:55,866
than Mr. Krupp ever was.

1545
01:13:59,175 --> 01:14:01,018
But, you know, George...

1546
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:03,496
bringing back Krupp
permanently...

1547
01:14:04,295 --> 01:14:06,775
we'll never be
in the same class again.

1548
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,136
Yeah, I know.

1549
01:14:09,055 --> 01:14:11,535
But just 'cause we're
in separate classes,

1550
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:13,219
doesn't mean
we can't be friends...

1551
01:14:14,055 --> 01:14:17,741
Well, yeah. I mean, we'll
always be friends. Right?

1552
01:14:17,895 --> 01:14:20,341
Yeah. Hey, in fact,
you know what?

1553
01:14:20,535 --> 01:14:21,582
Let's do a blood oath.

1554
01:14:21,735 --> 01:14:23,991
But minus the blood. I don't
wanna see the blood. No blood.

1555
01:14:24,015 --> 01:14:25,062
Pinky swear?

1556
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:26,216
No, that's lame. Mmm-mmm.

1557
01:14:26,575 --> 01:14:28,304
Oh, got it!

1558
01:14:28,615 --> 01:14:30,060
Oh, no. What? No!

1559
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:31,501
That's not sanitary.

1560
01:14:31,655 --> 01:14:33,464
Can't we just do
a verbal declaration

1561
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:34,741
of friendship or something?

1562
01:14:35,015 --> 01:14:36,380
Oh. Okay. Yeah, wow.

1563
01:14:36,455 --> 01:14:39,106
I haven't really
prepared anything, but...

1564
01:14:40,535 --> 01:14:42,105
I, Harold...

1565
01:14:42,255 --> 01:14:43,745
hereby declare George

1566
01:14:43,815 --> 01:14:47,456
as my best friend,
permanently, forever.

1567
01:14:47,615 --> 01:14:50,619
And I, George, accept
the permanent rights...

1568
01:14:50,815 --> 01:14:52,055
that Harold has given me

1569
01:14:52,135 --> 01:14:54,058
to be his best friend forever...

1570
01:14:54,215 --> 01:14:56,695
and the constitution
of friends...

1571
01:14:56,855 --> 01:14:57,856
America, friendship.

1572
01:14:58,015 --> 01:14:59,231
And the United States
of America.

1573
01:14:59,255 --> 01:15:00,751
Land and the United States.
Good, okay, yeah.

1574
01:15:00,775 --> 01:15:02,055
It's done. All right, cool.
Phew.

1575
01:15:02,215 --> 01:15:03,944
What a relief.
Yeah, no kidding.

1576
01:15:04,095 --> 01:15:05,455
I mean,
why were we even worried...

1577
01:15:05,495 --> 01:15:07,657
about that whole classroom
thing in the first place?

1578
01:15:07,815 --> 01:15:08,816
You know, I don't know.

1579
01:15:08,975 --> 01:15:10,261
We were younger then.

1580
01:15:10,455 --> 01:15:11,616
Clearly, we have grown.

1581
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:12,776
Clearly, we have.

1582
01:15:13,135 --> 01:15:14,136
Chums!

1583
01:15:14,255 --> 01:15:15,381
Thank you for chronicling

1584
01:15:15,455 --> 01:15:17,742
my surprisingly
grounded biography.

1585
01:15:17,895 --> 01:15:20,501
The truth is a slippery thing.

1586
01:15:20,655 --> 01:15:21,895
And you nailed it.

1587
01:15:24,095 --> 01:15:26,336
Now it is time to fly again!

1588
01:15:26,495 --> 01:15:28,384
Farewell, my dear sidekicks.

1589
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:33,104
Goodbye, Captain Underpants.

1590
01:15:33,255 --> 01:15:34,336
Goodbye.

1591
01:15:46,255 --> 01:15:47,666
George! Harold!

1592
01:15:49,615 --> 01:15:51,391
What am I doing in your
tree house again?

1593
01:15:54,335 --> 01:15:55,939
You boys are in big trouble!

1594
01:15:57,295 --> 01:15:58,740
I don't know how big yet...

1595
01:15:58,895 --> 01:16:00,335
Why does this keep happening?

1596
01:16:00,375 --> 01:16:02,218
Where are my clothes?
Where are they?

1597
01:16:04,855 --> 01:16:05,936
I don't get it.

1598
01:16:06,135 --> 01:16:07,216
Why is Krupp so angry

1599
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,218
and Captain Underpants so happy?

1600
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:13,346
Maybe it's because
Captain Underpants had us.

1601
01:16:13,495 --> 01:16:16,021
You know, he had friends.

1602
01:16:16,455 --> 01:16:19,538
We could fix that.

1603
01:16:19,735 --> 01:16:22,420
Yeah, you know, we could.

1604
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:24,900
So that's how we came

1605
01:16:24,975 --> 01:16:26,465
to pull the rarest prank
of all...

1606
01:16:27,855 --> 01:16:29,220
The prank...

1607
01:16:29,695 --> 01:16:31,026
for good.

1608
01:16:31,215 --> 01:16:32,216
Huh?

1609
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:37,423
"Do you want to go a date?"

1610
01:16:38,175 --> 01:16:39,222
A date?

1611
01:16:41,175 --> 01:16:42,381
"Love, Edith."

1612
01:16:42,535 --> 01:16:43,741
"Principal Krupp."

1613
01:16:43,935 --> 01:16:44,936
Oh!

1614
01:16:45,255 --> 01:16:49,101
Benjamin Krupp, you sly dog.

1615
01:16:50,175 --> 01:16:52,985
Edith, the lunch lady.

1616
01:16:53,135 --> 01:16:54,466
Big plans tonight, Mr. Krupp?

1617
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:57,539
No! What?
That's none of your business!

1618
01:16:57,895 --> 01:17:00,944
But, if you must know...

1619
01:17:01,095 --> 01:17:03,826
yeah, I actually do.

1620
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:07,025
By the way,
I was tidying up my office...

1621
01:17:07,175 --> 01:17:09,416
and I believe
these belong to you...

1622
01:17:09,615 --> 01:17:10,662
Our comics?

1623
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:13,175
Did you just pull that out
of the garbage can?

1624
01:17:13,255 --> 01:17:14,825
Well, I read them...

1625
01:17:14,935 --> 01:17:15,991
and considering
they're completely

1626
01:17:16,015 --> 01:17:17,062
implausible, juvenile...

1627
01:17:17,135 --> 01:17:19,183
and filled with
the lowest form of wit...

1628
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:20,706
potty humor...

1629
01:17:20,855 --> 01:17:22,584
they're actually pretty funny.

1630
01:17:23,015 --> 01:17:24,380
See ya later!

1631
01:17:27,295 --> 01:17:29,263
Well, how about that...

1632
01:17:46,255 --> 01:17:47,939
That's a good one.

1633
01:17:48,175 --> 01:17:50,781
You know, it feels good to do
something nice for Mr. Krupp.

1634
01:17:50,935 --> 01:17:52,778
Yeah, you know what? It does.

1635
01:17:52,855 --> 01:17:53,951
Promise we'll never do it again.

1636
01:17:53,975 --> 01:17:55,022
Promise.

1637
01:17:55,095 --> 01:17:56,096
Oh, my!

1638
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:57,501
I've never been to

1639
01:17:57,575 --> 01:17:59,304
such a fancy restaurant before.

1640
01:18:00,535 --> 01:18:04,904
Well, I had to go all out
for m'lady.

1641
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:08,138
Okay, if you say so, my man!

1642
01:18:10,575 --> 01:18:12,782
Once again,
that brings our story

1643
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,186
to its happy conclusion.

1644
01:18:14,335 --> 01:18:16,455
I think there's some valuable
life lessons in there...

1645
01:18:16,495 --> 01:18:17,496
somewhere.

1646
01:18:17,575 --> 01:18:18,576
What the?

1647
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:20,146

01:18:23,495 --> 01:18:25,304
Yum, yum! Eat 'em up!

1650
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,741
Oh, no!

1651
01:18:30,615 --> 01:18:32,060
Waiter! Check please!

1652
01:18:36,815 --> 01:18:38,579
Principal Krupp!

1653
01:18:38,735 --> 01:18:39,736
Oh, no!

1654
01:18:41,055 --> 01:18:42,341
Help!

1655
01:18:44,055 --> 01:18:45,056
Hang on, sidekicks!

1656
01:18:45,255 --> 01:18:46,256
I don't get it!

1657
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:47,945
I really thought
breaking that ring

1658
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:49,665
would get rid of his powers!

1659
01:18:50,615 --> 01:18:53,619
Yeah, well, here we go again!

1660
01:18:57,735 --> 01:18:59,658
Tra-la-laa!

1661
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,982
<i>Are you worried
about impending doom?</i>

1662
01:19:14,255 --> 01:19:16,701
<i>Those evil villains
got you filled with gloom</i>

1663
01:19:17,015 --> 01:19:20,019
<i>But don? you fear,
there's a hero in the sky</i>

1664
01:19:20,135 --> 01:19:22,024
<i>The sky, the sky</i>

1665
01:19:22,815 --> 01:19:23,896
<i>it's not a bird</i>

1666
01:19:23,975 --> 01:19:25,386
<i>And it's not a plane</i>

1667
01:19:25,975 --> 01:19:28,501
<i>And it's not
an egg salad sandwich</i>

1668
01:19:28,815 --> 01:19:30,817
<i>It's the waistband warrior</i>

1669
01:19:30,935 --> 01:19:32,778
<i>Hear his mighty battle cry!</i>

1670

01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:48,699
<i>He's bustin' down doors</i>

1677
