My grandmother gave it to me.

297
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:24,065
She said it started
from a tiny grain of sand,

298
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:29,469
but then, after a while,
it grew into something beautiful.

299
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:33,708
Dreams can begin small too.

300
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:37,177
- No. No, I couldn't...
- Take it.

301
00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:40,443
It'll get you the money you need
for Mr. Sykes.

302
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:49,317
What do you mean, you don't understand?
We've been over it 1,000 times.

303
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:51,383
I don't want to have to say it again.

304
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:54,828
You're really giving me agita.
I don't know how else to say this.

305
00:17:54,897 --> 00:17:58,264
You see something,
you kill it, you eat it. Period. Thanks.

306
00:17:58,334 --> 00:18:01,201
That's what sharks do.
That's a fine tradition.

307
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,263
What's the matter with you? Your
brother Frankie, here, he's a killer.

308
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:07,002
- Thanks, Pop.
- He's beautiful.

309
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:10,409
He does what he's supposed to do.
Wipe your face.

310
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,507
But you... I'm hearin' things.

311
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:18,680
You gotta understand, when you
look weak it makes me look weak.

312
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:21,985
- I can't have that.
- I know, Pop, I'm sorry.

313
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:25,118
Lenny. Lenny. Look at me.
Look at me.

314
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:28,493
This handin' over the business,
it's for you, for both of yous,

315
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:31,158
and you're acting
like you don't even want it.

316
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:35,167
I need to know that
you can handle that.

00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:43,110
All right. Right here,

00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:46,808

- Yeah. Gee, thanks, Pop.

321
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:48,282
Here's the thing.

322
00:18:48,351 --> 00:18:52,788
I'm on a diet. I read an article about
these shrimps. They're not good for ya.

323
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:56,848
You know how many calories
are in one of those shrimps?

324
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:57,915
A lot.

325
00:18:57,994 --> 00:19:00,360
It's true.
It's true and the other thing is,

326
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:04,661
my sister had a baby and I took it over
because she passed away

327
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:07,760
and then the baby lost its legs
and its arms

328
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:11,568
and now it's nothing but a stump
but I still take care of it with my wife

329
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:16,078
and it's growing and it's fairly happy,

330
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:19,979
but it's difficult 'cause I've been
working a second shift at the factory

331
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:22,040
to put food on the table,

332
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:27,181
but all the love I see in that little
guy's face makes it worth it in the end.

333
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:31,351
True story.

I'm tellin' you. Eat it!

336
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,597
- No. Have mercy.
- Pop, please...

337
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,932
- Eat!
- No eat.

338
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:44,370

339
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,907
No, please.

- Lenny! Eat, eat, eat!
- Don't! Pop!

341
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:51,612
Put the shrimp down!

342
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:56,410
Go now. No one's looking.
Get out of here.

343
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:58,749
- You're free, now go.
- Thank you.

344
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:01,346
You're a good person.

Come on, fellas.

346
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:16,453
Pop, I can handle the reef.
It's not a problem.

347
00:20:16,522 --> 00:20:19,389
No. We're gonna do this as a family.

348
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,359
Frankie, I want you to take Lenny out,
show him the ropes.

349
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:25,625
- Come on, Pop.
- You're gonna learn how to be a shark.

350
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:27,956

00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:37,116
Just say the word, boss.

356
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:41,152
Carrying a big ol' envelope full of
money, gonna give it to Mr. Sykes.

357
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,960
Hurry up. This is our chance,
we don't want to miss it.

358
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:46,866
- You sure?
- My trainer friend tipped me off.

359
00:20:46,936 --> 00:20:49,734
The race is rigged. We can't lose.

360

- What's the horse's name?
- Lucky Day.

No, wait. What am I doing?

Remember what Angie said.

Five thousand on Lucky Day to win.

372
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:29,735
That's 200 to one.
That would pay a million clams.

373

Well, I guess that makes me

to the concession stand.

00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:49,254
Mind bringing us back some drinks?
That would be great, thanks.

399

the gum under the seats.

- Five grand? My five grand?!
- No, it was another five grand.

- Clearly I've made a mistake.
- No, no, wait! Lola!

Look. Deep down, I'm really superficial.

Fish Fingers, then Seabiscuit
and Salmonella.

424
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:09,462
Lucky Day seems to be having trouble
getting out of the gate.

425
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:12,006
- What?
- Only a sucker would bet on that horse.

426
00:24:12,074 --> 00:24:15,100
Don't sweat it.
He does this all the time. He's playin'.

427
00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:18,977
What's this? Lucky Day is now
crashing his way through the gate,

428
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:20,709
and he's off and running.

429
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:22,375
Seabiscuit, Fish Fingers...

430

Please, Lucky Day.
Go fast.

431
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:30,492
Coming around the turn it's Seabiscuit
by a length and Lucky Day well behind.

432
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,220
And here comes Lucky Day,

433
00:24:32,294 --> 00:24:36,253
coming up from behind,
passing Yellow Tail, Salmonella.

You see? Who's your fish now? Go.

435
00:24:38,534 --> 00:24:41,059
Around the final turn,
here comes Lucky Day.

436
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:43,434
Lucky Day's now caught up
to Fish Fingers.

437
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:46,634
They're head to head. Neck to neck.
Lucky Day's ahead.

438

I'm tired just thinkin'
about countin' all of this money.

Shh! The Sharkslayer.

- Yeah.

So, look, I'm gonna take off...

And I'm a Sharkslayer,

No snuggly, buggly...

Rule number two,
and this is the most important rule.

In the event that possibly
you get hungry...

Don't worry, I won't eat anyone.

I'm different from other sharks.

Let's put it that way,
leave it at that. Good night.

00:47:11,259 --> 00:47:13,326
- Define "different".
- You'll laugh.

843
00:47:13,326 --> 00:47:14,837
I'm not gonna laugh.
