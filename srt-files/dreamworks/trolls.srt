1
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:52,284
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

2
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:55,201
<i>In a happy forest, in the happiest tree...</i>

3
00:00:55,993 --> 00:00:58,288
<i>Lived the happiest creatures
the world has ever known.</i>

4
00:00:58,955 --> 00:00:59,873
<i>The Trolls.</i>

5
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:06,050
<i>They loved nothing more
than to sing, and dance, and hug.</i>

6
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,972
<i>Dance, and hug, and sing, and dance,
and sing, and hug, and dance...</i>

7
00:01:10,052 --> 00:01:11,887
<i>And hug, and dance, and sing, and hug,
and dance, and hug...</i>

8
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:17,605
<i>But then one day,
the Trolls were discovered by...</i>

9
00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:19,145
<i>A Bergen!</i>

10
00:01:20,563 --> 00:01:22,316
<i>The Bergens didn't know how to sing...</i>

11
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:25,486
<i>Or dance... or even hug.</i>

12
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:29,032
<i>They were the most
miserable creatures in all the land.</i>

13
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:32,289
<i>And once they saw
how happy the Trolls were...</i>

14
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,996
<i>They wanted some of that
happiness for themselves.</i>

15
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:39,710
Oh, my God!

16
00:01:40,294 --> 00:01:43,135
<i>Eating a Troll made them feel so happy...</i>

17
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:45,220
<i>They started a tradition.</i>

18
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,474
<i>Once a year, every year...</i>

19
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:49,976
<i>The Bergens would gather
around the Troll tree...</i>

20
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:52,020
<i>To taste happiness...</i>

21
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,148
<i>On a holiday they called...</i>

22
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:56,396
<i>Trollstice.</i>

23
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,710
Good morning, Daddy!

24
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:20,382
Daddy, wake up! Daddy, wake up!
Wake up! Wake up, Daddy!

25
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:23,473
Wake up, Daddy.

26
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:25,809
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

27
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:27,224
Daddy, wake up!

28
00:02:28,434 --> 00:02:30,436
Gristle! What time is it?

29
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,023
It's Trollstice!

30
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:38,198
Trollstice! Our one day to be happy.

31
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:39,282
Yeah!

32
00:02:39,362 --> 00:02:41,741
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

33
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:45,203
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

34
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:53,340
Please give it up
for your keeper of the Trolls...

35
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,634
Your minister of happiness...

36
00:02:55,714 --> 00:02:57,175
Your Royal Chef...

37
00:02:58,301 --> 00:02:59,302
Me.

38
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,569
This is a very special Trollstice...

39
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:14,322
As there is one amongst us
who has never tasted a Troll.

40
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,826
Me! She is talking about me!

41
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,074
Prince Gristle...

42
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,747
The time has come.

43
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:21,957
It's okay, son.

44
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:25,419
I remember being nervous my first time.

45
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:26,670
Okay.

46
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,753
That's my boy.

47
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:33,345
It is my sacred duty...

48
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:37,388
To initiate you
in the ways of true happiness.

49
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,688
I have chosen an extra-Special Troll,
just for you.

50
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:48,443
The happiest, the most positive...

51
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:50,948
Sweetest Troll of all.

52
00:03:51,028 --> 00:03:53,951
And because every prince
deserves a princess...

53
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:57,911
I give you the one
they call Princess Poppy.

54
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:00,706
Please make me happy, Princess Poppy.

55
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:02,917
What are you feeling?

56
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:06,963
That one's rotten!

57
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,179
It's fake?

58
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,138
Fake?

59
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,178
Fake?

60
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,347
They're gone?

61
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,521
Where are they?

62
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:19,895
Don't worry, sire. We'll find them.

63
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:23,191
I think I hear something!

64
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:26,194
Go! Go!

65
00:04:26,944 --> 00:04:28,033
We got Poppy!

66
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:29,493
- Pass her to me!
- Here comes Poppy!

67
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:30,699
Here she is!

68
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:32,955
There's my princess.

69
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:34,077
Da-da.

70
00:04:34,536 --> 00:04:37,042
King Peppy, some of the others
can't keep up.

71
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:39,501
No Troll left behind!

72
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:43,380
Thank you, King Peppy!

73
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:45,925
- Thank you, King Peppy!
- Thank you!

74
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,473
Thank you, King Peppy.

75
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:51,765
No Troll left behind!

76
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:56,314
Daddy, where are they?

77
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:59,569
Don't just stand there! Make my son happy!

78
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,651
He will be happy!

79
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:24,511
Where is he?

80
00:05:29,183 --> 00:05:31,644
I don't think King Peppy made it.

81
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:39,027
When I say no Troll left behind...

82
00:05:40,237 --> 00:05:45,118
I mean, no Troll left behind!

83
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:50,669
King Peppy, where's Princess Poppy?

84
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:52,963
Don't worry. She's safe.

85
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:55,463
No Troll left behind!

86
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,967
But we'll be a lot safer
the further we get from Bergen Town.

87
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:01,219
Go, go! Hurry!

88
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,520
<i>That's right! Take her away!</i>

89
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,313
Get her out of my sight!

90
00:06:07,393 --> 00:06:12,149
She is hereby banished
from Bergen Town forever.

91
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,988
We can all be happy again.

92
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:16,945
I'll find the Trolls!

93
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,828
And shove them down
your ungrateful throats.

94
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:32,339
But, Daddy...

95
00:06:32,923 --> 00:06:35,383
I never got to eat a Troll.

96
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:38,930
What's gonna make me happy now?

97
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:43,143
Come here, son.

98
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:47,109
Nothing.

99
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:50,321
Absolutely nothing.

100
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:54,739
You will never, ever, ever, ever be happy.

101
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,574
Never?

102
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,410
Ever.

103
00:07:10,758 --> 00:07:13,639
Here! Right here!

104
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:17,557
This is where we will
rebuild our civilization.

105
00:07:18,892 --> 00:07:21,648
It has everything we need.

106
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:24,277
Fresh air, clean water...

107
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:26,776
And sweet acoustics.

108
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:36,624
<i>Ba de ya say do you remember</i>

109
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:40,545
<i>Ba de ya dancing in September</i>

110
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:44,964
<i>Ba de ya never was a cloudy day</i>

111
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:51,600
Twenty years ago today,
King Peppy made us safe...

112
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,812
And now every Troll is free
to be happy and live in perfect...

113
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:55,771
<i>Harmony</i>

114
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:56,730
<i>Harmony</i>

115
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,191
<i>Harmony</i>

116
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:00,527
And that's why we hug every hour.

117
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:01,486
Yep.

118
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:03,447
I wish it was every half hour.

119
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:04,615
So do I.

120
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:07,326
But that wouldn't leave much time
for singing and dancing, now would it?

121
00:08:07,406 --> 00:08:10,664
Princess Poppy, do the Bergens
still want to eat us?

122
00:08:10,744 --> 00:08:11,578
You bet!

123
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:15,290
But just because it's the only way
they'll ever be happy.

124
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,464
Oh, no. I do taste delicious.

125
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:21,718
Isn't there anything else
to make them happy?

126
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:23,637
What about having birthday parties?

127
00:08:23,717 --> 00:08:25,139
Or slumber parties?

128
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:28,389
Or staring at your parents
while they sleep.

129
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:31,229
But I don't want to be food.

130
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:34,149
Don't worry. No Troll ever will be.

131
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,902
And that's why we're celebrating
with the biggest party ever.

132
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:40,030
Everybody's gonna be there.

133
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,904
Everybody?

134
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:43,532
Everybody.

135
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:53,000
<i>Everybody, move your hair and feel united</i>

136
00:08:56,462 --> 00:09:00,926
<i>Everybody, shake your hair and feel united</i>

137
00:09:05,598 --> 00:09:07,854
<i>Yeah, everybody's coming
to the celebration</i>

138
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:11,984
<i>I'ma hook you up with the invitation
let your hair swing and party with me</i>

139
00:09:12,064 --> 00:09:13,649
<i>No bad vibes just love, you'll see</i>

140
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:17,990
<i>Do the D-A-N-C-E, one-two-three-four fight</i>

141
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,911
<i>Stick to the B-E-A-T, get ready to</i>

142
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:22,120
<i>Ignite</i>

143
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,167
<i>You are such a P-Y-T
catching all the lights</i>

144
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:29,922
<i>Just easy as A-B-C
that's how you make it right</i>

145
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,965
<i>It ain't hard out here
when you're doing it right</i>

146
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:34,468
<i>Put a smile on blast that's the Troll life</i>

147
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:38,598
<i>And I'm here to help you through it
come on, Smidge, I know you can do it</i>

148
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,222
Your confidence gives me strength.

149
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:50,487
Okay, Mr. Dinkles.

150
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:52,235
Say, leaves!

151
00:09:55,155 --> 00:09:56,490
Something's missing.

152
00:09:59,994 --> 00:10:00,953
That's it!

153
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:04,545
<i>Don't stop, don't stop don't stop the beat</i>

154
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,505
<i>I can't stop, can't stop
can't stop the beat</i>

155
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:08,382
<i>I won't stop, won't stop
won't stop the beat</i>

156
00:10:08,462 --> 00:10:09,506
<i>Go!</i>

157
00:10:11,508 --> 00:10:15,929
<i>Everybody, shake your hair and feel united</i>

158
00:10:17,972 --> 00:10:21,856
<i>Sunshine day, everybody's singing</i>

159
00:10:21,936 --> 00:10:23,357
<i>Sunshine day</i>

160
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:28,235
<i>Everybody, move your hair and feel united</i>

161
00:10:37,161 --> 00:10:38,246
Yeah!

162
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:48,052
Unbelievable, guys.

163
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:50,097
Really, really great. Good job.

164
00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:52,224
I could hear you from a mile away!

165
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:54,477
Good. I was worried we weren't
projecting enough.

166
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:58,564
Poppy, if I can hear you,
so can the Bergens.

167
00:10:58,644 --> 00:10:59,649
Oh, boy.

168
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:01,151
- Here we go again.
- Oh, Branch...

169
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:02,569
You always ruin everything.

170
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:04,068
Warning us about the Bergens.

171
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,444
No, I don't.

172
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:08,030
The Bergens are coming!

173
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,201
The Bergens are coming!

174
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,121
The Bergens are coming!

175
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:18,212
Come on! We haven't seen a Bergen
in 20 years.

176
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:19,547
They're not gonna find us.

177
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:23,259
No, they're not going to find me,
because I'll be in my highly camouflaged...

178
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,097
Heavily fortified,
Bergen-proof survival bunker.

179
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:27,932
You mean you're not coming
to the party tonight?

180
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:29,684
But it's going to be the biggest...

181
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:30,644
The loudest...

182
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,559
The craziest party ever!

183
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:35,941
Big? Loud?

184
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:37,067
Crazy?

185
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:39,362
You're just gonna lead the Bergens
right to us!

186
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:43,199
Are you sure you wanna invite
this party pooper to poop on your party?

187
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,078
Yes. I think everyone deserves
to be happy.

188
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:47,538
I don't do happy.

189
00:11:47,618 --> 00:11:50,375
Branch, I know you have happiness
inside you.

190
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:52,540
You just need our help to find it.

191

<i>Celebrate freedom from the Bergens</i>

192
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:09,977
What do you say, Branch?

193
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:14,819
Oh, my God.

194
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:17,321
I wouldn't be caught dead at your party,
but you will be.

195
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:18,948
Caught and dead.

196
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:20,200
Whoa, whoa.

197
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,241
Easy, Branch. Easy.

198
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,250
Thank you for providing
safe passage, brother.

199
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,835
Namaste.

200
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:33,632
Okay, first of all, mate, thanks for sharing
your unique perspective on things.

201
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:34,800
Again.

202
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,929
But, just for now, why don't you try on
some positivity, eh?

203
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,767
A little positivity
might go with that vest.

204
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:43,143
Okay, fine.

205
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:46,227
I'm positive
you all are going to get eaten.

206
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,735
- Hug time!
- It is hug time.

207
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:51,820
Hug time!

208
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,906
- That feels good.
- Our hearts are synchronizing!

209
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:56,238
<i>I can squeeze you forever</i>

210
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,914
Someday, when the Bergens find us...

211
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:03,625
And the survival of every Troll
is in your hands...

212
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:06,253
I sure hope the answer
is singing, dancing, and hugging...

213
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,005
Because that's all you know how to do.

214
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:11,343
That is not true!
Poppy can also scrapbook.

215
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,176
I can't believe
you're gonna be queen one day.

216
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:20,686
Tune out his negative vibrations, Poppy.
They're toxic.

217
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,981
Some folks just don't want to be happy.

218
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:25,275
I guess.

219
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:26,610
You guessed right.

220
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,691
Boop.

221
00:13:31,863 --> 00:13:33,198
Yeah!

222
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,456
I love you so much!

223
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:47,547
Yeah!

224
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:49,926
Whoo! Glitter!

225
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:56,933
Yolo!

226
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:14,286
More glitter!

227
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:19,375
Turn it up!

228
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:40,608
I can't hear you!

229
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:46,490
Trolls.

230
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:48,412
Okay, everyone.

231
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:50,582
I just want to take a moment...

232
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,334
And get a little real.

233
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:53,418
Poppy!

234
00:14:53,498 --> 00:14:55,166
She's my friend! I know her!

235
00:14:57,836 --> 00:15:02,595
I'd like to take a second
to celebrate our king...

236
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:03,593
My father...

237
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:06,934
Who, 20 years ago this night...

238
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:09,766
Saved all of us from those dreaded...

239
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,525
Bergens.

240
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:23,908
Gotcha.

241
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:30,833
Cupcake?

242
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:35,338
Run!

243
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:37,590
Run! Run!

244
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:39,342
Poppy, help!

245
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:41,181
Mr. Dinkles?

246
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:43,180
Has anybody seen Mr. Dinkles?

247
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:45,185
Biggie!

248
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:48,269
Blend in! Blend in! Blend in!

249
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:49,562
Poppy!

250
00:15:50,522 --> 00:15:51,649
Run!

251
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:55,781
Run, Smidge!

254
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:02,035
Hurry!

255
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:04,079
Go! Go! Go!

256
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:08,880
- Cooper!
- Everyone, minimize your auras!

257
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,462
- Creek!
- No! Poppy!

258
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:13,757
- Hold on.
- Poppy!

259
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:16,468
- No!
- Creek!

260
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:23,268
Bad Bergen! Bad, bad Bergen.

261
00:16:24,477 --> 00:16:26,192
Bad, bad Bergen!

262
00:16:26,272 --> 00:16:27,064
Dad!

263
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:48,634
Thanks for throwing the biggest...

264
00:16:48,714 --> 00:16:50,762
The loudest...

265
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,927
The craziest party ever.

266
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,065
Is it coming back?

267
00:17:38,145 --> 00:17:40,189
What are we gonna do now?

268
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:43,363
We have to find a new home.
Everyone, hurry.

269
00:17:43,443 --> 00:17:45,699
We have to leave
before the Bergens come back.

270
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:46,951
We have to rescue them.

271
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:50,288
No, Poppy, we have to run.
Now, let's go, everyone. Come on!

272
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:53,622
What about "no Troll left behind"?

273
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,044
I'm sorry, Poppy.

274
00:17:56,124 --> 00:18:00,003
That was a long time ago.
And I'm not the king I once was.

275
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,344
Then I'll go.

276
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:05,013
I'll go and save them.

277
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:07,683
No, Poppy. It's too dangerous.

278
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:09,268
I have to at least try.

279
00:18:09,348 --> 00:18:12,314
No. You can't go to Bergen Town
by yourself.

280
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:13,853
It's impossible.

286
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:48,522
Branch, are you in there?

287
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:50,232
I'm not going to your party.

288
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:53,152
The party's over.
We just got attacked by a Bergen.

289
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,400
I knew it.

290
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:07,290
Branch!

291
00:19:07,832 --> 00:19:09,250
I have to tell you something.

292
00:19:10,043 --> 00:19:10,877
I was just gonna...

293
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:15,553
What?

294
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:18,806
What could be so important that it's
worth leading the Bergen right to us?

295
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:19,849
The Bergen's gone!

296
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:21,935
You don't know that.
It could still be out there.

297
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:23,019
Watching.

298
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:24,229
Waiting.

299
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:25,894
Listening.

300
00:19:26,354 --> 00:19:27,525
No. It left!

301
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:30,236
It took Cooper, and Smidge,
and Fuzzbert...

302
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:34,112
And Satin, and Chenille, and Biggie,
and Guy Diamond, and Creek!

303
00:19:34,696 --> 00:19:36,865
Which is why I have to ask you.

304
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:39,913
Will you go to Bergen Town with me
and save everyone?

305
00:19:39,993 --> 00:19:41,290
What? No.

306
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,373
Branch, you can't say no.
They're your friends.

307
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,211
They're your friends.

308
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,173
I'm staying right here
in my bunker where it's safe.

309
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,382
That's great.

310
00:19:48,462 --> 00:19:50,509
You're the one guy who knows
more about Bergens than anyone...

311
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,221
But when we finally need you,
you just want to hide here forever?

312
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:55,804
Forever? No.

313
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:58,685
Yeah...

314
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:02,190
I really only have enough supplies
down here to last me 10 years...

315
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,942
11 if I'm willing to store
and drink my own sweat.

316
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:06,570
Which I am.

317
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,363
You all said I was crazy, huh?

318
00:20:08,443 --> 00:20:10,320
Well, who's crazy now?

319
00:20:10,862 --> 00:20:13,074
Me. Crazy prepared.

320
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:15,955
I'm sorry. I should have listened to you.

321
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:19,250
You told me not to throw the party,
and I threw it anyway.

322
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,793
And it's my fault they were taken.

323
00:20:20,873 --> 00:20:22,334
And now I don't know what to do.

324
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,004
Why don't you try
scrapbooking them to freedom?

325
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:27,424
Solid burn, Branch.

326
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:31,641
Well, thanks anyway.

327
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:33,848
Hey, anytime, Poppy. See you in 10 years.

328
00:20:51,827 --> 00:20:53,165
Oh, hey, Branch?

329
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:55,501
Just wondering
if I could borrow something.

330
00:20:55,581 --> 00:20:56,460
What?

331
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,045
- Your bunker.
- What?

332
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,210
Okay, everybody. Come on in!

333
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,589
Hi, Branch!

334
00:21:03,548 --> 00:21:05,220
No! No! No!

335
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,348
Whoa, wait! Poppy, what are you doing?

336
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:10,309
You said you have enough provisions
to last 10 years, right?

337
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:12,688
Yes, to last me 10 years. Me!

338
00:21:12,768 --> 00:21:14,022
It'll last them two weeks!

339
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:15,732
Then I guess I better hurry.

340
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:16,817
Wait, wait, wait!

341
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:18,527
You won't last a day out there.

342
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:20,567
And you won't last a day in here.

343
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:23,071
Chug, chug, chug!

344
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:29,039
Solid burn, returned.

345
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,746
Sorry, Branch!

346
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,582
Poppy, wait.

347
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,589
Please be careful.

348
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,755
Don't worry, Dad. I can do this.

349
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,925
I love you, Poppy.

350
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,679
I love you too, Dad.

351
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,645
They grow up so fast.

352
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:53,985
Bye, everybody! See you soon!

353
00:21:54,065 --> 00:21:56,234
Good luck, Princess Poppy!

354
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:01,072
And three, two, one.

355
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:04,705
Hug time!

356
00:22:04,785 --> 00:22:05,998
No.

357
00:22:06,078 --> 00:22:07,500
Hug time! Hug time! Hug time!

358
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,582
No! No!

359
00:22:13,087 --> 00:22:15,092
<i>With her friends safely hidden...</i>

360
00:22:15,172 --> 00:22:17,887
<i>Princess Poppy set off
to rescue her other friends...</i>

361
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:21,137
<i>Confident she'd make it
to Bergen Town on her own.</i>

362
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:26,476
<i>Convinced she'd make it to Bergen Town.</i>

363
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,488
Totally sure she'd make it to Bergen Town.

364
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:50,216
<i>I really hope I can do it</i>

365
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:53,008
<i>'Cause they're all depending on me</i>

366
00:22:53,634 --> 00:22:58,308
<i>I know that I must leave
the only home I've ever known</i>

367
00:22:58,388 --> 00:23:03,394
<i>And brave the dangers of the forest
saving them before they're eaten</i>

368
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:09,526
<i>I mean, how hard can that be?</i>

369
00:23:19,037 --> 00:23:23,337
<i>Looking up at a sunny sky
so shiny and blue and there's a butterfly</i>

370
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:26,212
<i>Well, isn't that a super fantastic sign?</i>

371
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:37,604
<i>It's gonna be a fantastic day</i>

372
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:39,772
<i>Such marvelousness it's gonna bring</i>

373
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,108
<i>Got a pocket full of songs
that I'm gonna sing</i>

374
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:45,112
<i>And I'm ready to take on anything</i>

375
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:46,780
<i>Hooray!</i>

376
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,366
<i>Some super fun surprise around each corner</i>

377
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,498
<i>Just riding on a rainbow</i>

378
00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:56,959
<i>I'm gonna be okay</i>

379
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,458
<i>Hey! I'm not giving up today</i>

380
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:02,211
<i>There's nothing getting in my way</i>

381
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:04,301
<i>And if you knock, knock me over</i>

382
00:24:04,381 --> 00:24:06,970
<i>I will get back up again</i>

383
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:10,058
<i>Oh! If something goes a little wrong</i>

384
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:12,310
<i>Well, you can go ahead and bring it on</i>

385
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,896
<i>'Cause if you knock, knock me over</i>

386
00:24:13,976 --> 00:24:16,729
<i>I will get back up again</i>

387
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:20,899
<i>Get back up again</i>

388
00:24:26,197 --> 00:24:28,287
<i>I'm marching along I've got confidence</i>

389
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,540
<i>I'm cooler than a pack of peppermints</i>

390
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,126
<i>And I haven't been this excited</i>

391
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:35,671
<i>Since I can't remember when</i>

392
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:40,300
<i>I'm off on this remarkable adventure</i>

393
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,971
<i>Just riding on a rainbow</i>

394
00:24:43,051 --> 00:24:45,348
<i>But what if it's all a big mistake?</i>

395
00:24:45,428 --> 00:24:47,977
<i>What if it's more than I can take?</i>

396
00:24:48,057 --> 00:24:49,812
<i>No, I can't think that way</i>

397
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:53,984
<i>'Cause I know that
I'm really, really, really gonna be okay</i>

398
00:24:54,064 --> 00:24:57,320
<i>Hey! I'm not giving up today</i>

399
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,823
<i>There's nothing getting in my way</i>

400
00:24:59,903 --> 00:25:00,991
<i>And if you knock, knock me over</i>

401
00:25:01,071 --> 00:25:04,075
<i>I will get back up again</i>

402
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,209
<i>If something goes a little wrong
well, you can go ahead and bring it on</i>

403
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:11,044
<i>'Cause if you knock, knock me over</i>

404
00:25:11,124 --> 00:25:14,087
<i>I will get back up again</i>

405
00:25:16,923 --> 00:25:18,257
<i>Get back up again</i>

406
00:25:22,595 --> 00:25:24,473
I'm okay!

407
00:25:27,935 --> 00:25:30,525
<i>And if you knock, knock me over
you knock, knock me over</i>

408
00:25:30,605 --> 00:25:35,111
<i>I will get back up again</i>

409
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:28,672
Get back!

410
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:46,275
Oh, no! Poppy?

411
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:48,528
Hang on!

412
00:26:54,952 --> 00:26:56,958
<i>Get back up again</i>

413
00:26:57,038 --> 00:26:58,293
Branch, my man!

414
00:26:58,373 --> 00:26:59,502
You are right on time.

415
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:01,671
Oh, right. Like you knew I was coming.

416
00:27:01,751 --> 00:27:03,298
Yes! I figured after the third hug time...

417
00:27:03,378 --> 00:27:05,134
Getting eaten by a Bergen
wouldn't seem so bad.

418
00:27:05,214 --> 00:27:08,012
And I figured there was no way
you could do this by yourself.

419
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:09,135
Guess we were both right.

420
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,516
All right. Let's do this!

421
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,145
Sooner we get to Bergen Town,
sooner we can rescue everybody...

422
00:27:14,225 --> 00:27:15,354
And make it home safely.

423
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:17,398
Wait, wait, wait. What's your plan?

424
00:27:17,478 --> 00:27:19,859
I just told you. To rescue everyone
and make it home safely.

425
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:22,403
Okay. That's not a plan.
That's a wish list.

426
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:24,569
Oh! I suppose you have a plan.

427
00:27:25,904 --> 00:27:27,155
First...

428
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:30,580
<i>We get to the edge of Bergen Town
without being spotted.</i>

429
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,333
<i>Then, we get inside by sneaking
through the old escape tunnels...</i>

430
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:35,419
<i>Which will then lead us
to the Troll tree...</i>

431
00:27:35,499 --> 00:27:38,172
<i>Right before we get caught,
and suffer a miserable death...</i>

432
00:27:38,252 --> 00:27:40,925
<i>At the hands of a horrible,
bloodthirsty Bergen!</i>

433
00:27:41,005 --> 00:27:43,344
Hold on a second,
are you scrapbooking my plan?

434
00:27:43,424 --> 00:27:45,847
Yeah. Almost...

435
00:27:45,927 --> 00:27:46,928
Done!

436
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:48,931
<i>We did it!</i>

437
00:27:56,982 --> 00:27:58,317
There will be no more...

438
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:01,528
Scrapbooking.

439
00:28:04,532 --> 00:28:06,079
Do you have to sing?

440
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,789
I always sing when I'm in a good mood.

441
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:09,416
Do you have to be in a good mood?

442
00:28:09,496 --> 00:28:10,584
Why wouldn't I be?

443
00:28:10,664 --> 00:28:13,254
By this time tomorrow,
I'll be with all my friends!

444
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:15,548
I wonder what they're doing right now.

445
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:17,133
Probably being digested.

446
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:19,094
They're alive, Branch. I know it!

447
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:20,637
You don't know anything, Poppy.

448
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:22,389
And I can't wait
to see the look on your face...

449
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:25,393
When you realize the world
isn't all cupcakes and rainbows.

450
00:28:25,473 --> 00:28:26,390
'Cause it isn't.

451
00:28:26,807 --> 00:28:28,479
Bad things happen...

452
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,021
And there's nothing you can do about it.

453
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,821
Hey, I know it's not
all cupcakes and rainbows.

454
00:28:34,901 --> 00:28:37,282
But I'd rather go through life
thinking that it mostly is...

455
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:38,741
Instead of being like you.

456
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:40,410
You don't sing, you don't dance.

457
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,368
So grey all the time!
What happened to you?

458
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:46,330
A Bergen?

459
00:28:46,914 --> 00:28:47,998
Maybe.

460
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:53,592
There's no Bergen, is there?

461
00:28:53,672 --> 00:28:56,008
You just said that so I'd stop talking.

462
00:28:56,676 --> 00:28:57,677
Maybe.

463
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:22,705
So special.

464
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:25,625
Goodnight, Cooper.

465
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:28,798
Good night, Smidge. Good night, Fuzzbert.

466
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:31,052
Good night, Satin. Good night, Chenille.

467
00:29:31,132 --> 00:29:33,721
Good night, Biggie. Good night, DJ.

468
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:35,137
Good night, Guy Diamond.

469
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:37,097
Good night, Creek.

470
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:38,602
Boop.

471
00:29:38,682 --> 00:29:40,017
And good night, Poppy.

472
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:51,697
Don't even think about it.

473
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:06,467
<i>Stars shining bright above you</i>

474
00:30:06,547 --> 00:30:08,678
Really? Seriously? More singing?

475
00:30:08,758 --> 00:30:11,640
Yes, seriously! Singing helps me relax.

476
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,141
Maybe you ought to try it.

477
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:17,522
I don't sing, and I don't relax.
This is the way I am, and I like it.

478
00:30:17,602 --> 00:30:19,812
I also like a little silence.

479
00:30:29,073 --> 00:30:32,452
<i>Hello, darkness, my old friend</i>

480
00:30:33,244 --> 00:30:35,665
<i>I've come to talk with you again</i>

481
00:30:36,582 --> 00:30:37,837
Hello.

482
00:30:37,917 --> 00:30:41,462
<i>Because a vision softly creeping</i>

483
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:47,347
<i>Left its seeds while I was sleeping</i>

484
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:52,975
<i>And the vision
that was planted in my brain</i>

485
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,522
<i>Still remains</i>

486
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:01,151
<i>Within the sound...</i>

487
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,073
<i>Of silence</i>

488
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:11,997
May I?

489
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:26,351
So one of these tunnels
leads to the Troll tree.

490
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:27,352
That's right.

491
00:31:27,432 --> 00:31:28,975
There's so many of them.

492
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,689
I wonder which one.

493
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:32,316
I don't know.

494
00:31:32,396 --> 00:31:35,654
Choose a hole wisely!

495
00:31:35,734 --> 00:31:38,907
For one will lead to Bergen Town...

496
00:31:38,987 --> 00:31:42,118
And the others, to certain death.

497
00:31:42,198 --> 00:31:43,199
Who said that?

498
00:31:43,658 --> 00:31:45,828
It was...

499
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:47,667
Me.

500
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:51,046
Hey, guys, how's it going?
Welcome to the root tunnels.

501
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:52,339
I just wanted to warn you.

502
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:54,591
One of these tunnels leads
to the Troll tree...

503
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:58,051
And the others to certain death,
death, death, death...

504
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:02,308
Do you think you can tell us
which is the right one?

505
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:03,393
You bet!

506
00:32:03,473 --> 00:32:05,562
- Great!
- No, that's okay. We're fine, thanks!

507
00:32:05,642 --> 00:32:06,689
Branch.

508
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:07,940
He's trying to help us.

509
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,608
I don't like the looks of him.

510
00:32:09,688 --> 00:32:11,900
I mean, who wears socks with no shoes?

511
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:15,446
He seems to know what he's talking about.

512
00:32:16,364 --> 00:32:18,282
Okay, fine.

513
00:32:18,657 --> 00:32:20,079
Which way do we go?

514
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,999
First, you have to give me a high five.
Then I'll tell you.

515
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,168
- What?
- I love high fives. I'll do it.

516
00:32:25,248 --> 00:32:26,583
Oh, I know you'll do it.

517
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:28,335
But will he?

518
00:32:28,752 --> 00:32:30,717
All right, dumpy diapers, up high!

519
00:32:30,797 --> 00:32:32,135
Nope, I don't do high fives.

520
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:33,761
- Slap it, boss.
- Not gonna happen.

521
00:32:33,841 --> 00:32:35,556
- Party on the top floor.
- Nope.

522
00:32:35,636 --> 00:32:37,016
Little slappy. Make Daddy happy.

523
00:32:37,096 --> 00:32:38,142
That's weird.

524
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,852
Come on, just one little high five.

525
00:32:39,932 --> 00:32:41,729
No, thanks. I'm good.

526
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:42,893
Here, just do this...

527
00:32:43,435 --> 00:32:44,648
But with your hand.

528
00:32:44,728 --> 00:32:46,026
Thank you for that demonstration.

529
00:32:46,106 --> 00:32:48,236
Really cleared up
exactly what I will not be doing.

530
00:32:48,316 --> 00:32:50,239
Branch, it's a high five.

531
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,364
The others lead to certain death.
Get perspective.

532
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,250
One high five and then you'll tell us
which tunnel to take, right?

533
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,456
So easy.

534
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,916
Okay, fine!

535
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,379
Too slow.

536
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:05,586
Too slow?

537
00:33:08,214 --> 00:33:09,090
Classic.

538
00:33:09,674 --> 00:33:11,347
No, no. All right.

539
00:33:11,427 --> 00:33:13,724
I'm gonna let you slide with a fist bump.

540
00:33:13,804 --> 00:33:16,144
Shark attack! Nom-nom-nom-nom. Jellyfish!

541
00:33:16,224 --> 00:33:19,356
Hand sandwich. Turkey. Snowman. Dolphin.
Helicopter. Last supper. Monkey in a zoo.

542
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:20,645
- What?
- Gear shift.

543
00:33:30,072 --> 00:33:32,367
Okay, okay, okay. Now I'm thinking we hug.

544
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,087
- That's right. You better run, cloud!
- Wait!

545
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:40,505
I'm gonna tear your little cloud arms...

546
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,296
Off your cloud body,
and high five your face with them!

547
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,719
He's just a cloud!

548
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,763
- Get back here!
- Branch! He can help us!

549
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:48,973
Come back!

550
00:33:49,053 --> 00:33:50,057
Run, Cloud Guy!

551
00:33:50,137 --> 00:33:51,267
I'm gonna kill you!

552
00:33:51,347 --> 00:33:52,932
Ta-da! We're here!

553
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:56,440
You guys are a lot of fun.
You know, I gotta go.

554
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,944
Got some cloud stuff to take care of.
Catch you on the way back?

555
00:34:00,024 --> 00:34:00,983
Unless...

556
00:34:01,484 --> 00:34:03,152
You die.

557
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:06,743
The Troll tree.

558
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:08,533
Bergen Town.

559
00:34:23,509 --> 00:34:25,890
<i>I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad</i>

560
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:30,438
<i>I got sunshine in a bag I'm useless</i>

561
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:34,442
<i>But not for long the future is coming on</i>

562
00:34:34,522 --> 00:34:37,446
<i>I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad</i>

563
00:34:37,526 --> 00:34:42,326
<i>I got sunshine in a bag I'm useless</i>

564
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:46,080
<i>But not for long the future is coming on</i>

565
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,167
<i>Is coming on is coming on</i>

566
00:34:49,247 --> 00:34:51,670
<i>Coming on is coming on</i>

567
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,669
<i>Is coming on is coming on</i>

568
00:34:54,461 --> 00:34:57,340
Wow! They're as miserable as you.

569
00:34:58,049 --> 00:35:01,681
Which means
they haven't eaten a Troll yet.

570
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:03,767
Now, come on. Let's go save our friends.

571
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:04,768
Your friends.

572
00:35:04,848 --> 00:35:07,017
Our friends. Don't fight it.

573
00:35:15,318 --> 00:35:16,195
Oh, Barnabus.

574
00:35:17,029 --> 00:35:20,283
You're my only friend
in this whole miserable world.

575
00:35:22,118 --> 00:35:23,369
Dad was right.

576
00:35:25,163 --> 00:35:28,959
I'll never ever,
never ever, never be happy.

577
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,299
Never.

578
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:35,550
Never say never.

579
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:48,982
Chad. Todd.

580
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,282
Chef, where did you come from?

581
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:56,161
My father banished you 20 years ago.

582
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:58,497
Have you been standing
behind that plant this whole time?

583
00:35:58,577 --> 00:36:00,457
If only, sire.

584
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:02,418
No. I've been out in the wilderness...

585
00:36:02,498 --> 00:36:05,584
Thinking of nothing
but how I let you down.

586
00:36:07,087 --> 00:36:09,923
If only there was some way
I could make you feel better.

587
00:36:10,173 --> 00:36:11,262
Well, fat chance!

588
00:36:11,342 --> 00:36:13,973
The only way I'll ever be happy
is by eating a Troll...

589
00:36:14,053 --> 00:36:15,976
And that ain't gonna happen,
thanks to you.

590
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:19,351
But it just might. Thanks to me.

591
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:31,782
You found the Trolls.

592
00:36:34,535 --> 00:36:38,710
So this means
I might actually get to be happy!

593
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:39,707
That's right.

594
00:36:41,626 --> 00:36:45,342
Of course, everyone else in Bergen Town
will still be miserable...

595
00:36:45,422 --> 00:36:47,636
But that's not your concern.

596
00:36:47,716 --> 00:36:50,890
I am their king, so maybe it kinda is.

597
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,310
What exactly are you proposing?

598
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,436
Bringing back Trollstice? For everyone?

599
00:36:57,937 --> 00:37:00,318
Yes! That's exactly what I'm proposing.

600
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:04,155
Great idea, sire. Absolutely brilliant.
Aren't you smart?

601
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:05,323
I guess I am.

602
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:08,661
And I, your loyal Chef,
will be right behind you.

603
00:37:08,741 --> 00:37:09,745
Holding a knife.

604
00:37:09,825 --> 00:37:10,663
What's that?

605
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:12,540
Holding a knife, a spoon, a ladle.

606
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,417
I'm your chef, after all!

607
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:16,166
Yeah, you sure are!

608
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:21,297
I'm back!

609
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,427
You, scullery maid, what's your name?

610
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,595
Bridget.

611
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,515
Congratulations, Idget.
You work for me now.

612
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:29,393
So you take those dishes downstairs
and you start scrubbing.

613
00:37:29,473 --> 00:37:31,476
Yes, Chef. Thank you, Chef.

614
00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:40,027
Don't cry, Mr. Dinkles.

615
00:37:40,694 --> 00:37:43,363
Guys, Mr. Dinkles is really freaking out!

616
00:37:45,157 --> 00:37:49,624
Whoa, whoa! Everyone,
we must all remain calm.

617
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:51,919
<i>Comb</i>

618
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:55,628
That's right.
A calm Troll is a tasty Troll.

619
00:37:56,713 --> 00:38:00,429
And you are a key ingredient
in my recipe for success.

620
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:01,555
You see...

621
00:38:01,635 --> 00:38:04,558
He who controls the Trolls
controls the kingdom.

622
00:38:04,638 --> 00:38:07,437
And I am that "he!"

623
00:38:07,517 --> 00:38:08,392
You're a dude?

624
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:17,282
By this time tomorrow, I'll be queen...

625
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:20,618
And all of Bergen Town will get
exactly what they deserve.

626
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,410
True happiness!

627
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,340
- Chad.
- Todd.

628
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:49,943
So where do you think our friends are?

629
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:53,403
If I had to guess,
I'd say in a Bergen's stomach.

630
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,492
Could you try to be positive?

631
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:57,536
Just once. You might like it.

632
00:38:57,616 --> 00:38:59,872
Okay. I'm sure they're not only alive...

633
00:38:59,952 --> 00:39:03,084
But about to be delivered
to us on a silver platter.

634
00:39:03,164 --> 00:39:05,458
Thank you. That wasn't so hard, was it?

635
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:09,007
Branch!

636
00:39:09,087 --> 00:39:10,801
Hug time? Seriously?

637
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,049
Listen.

638
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:21,393
This is gonna be the best Trollstice ever!
Such a great idea I had.

639
00:39:22,144 --> 00:39:25,359
Yes. Tomorrow is Trollstice, everyone.
And it must be perfect!

640
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:26,402
Yes, Chef!

641
00:39:26,482 --> 00:39:29,819
Feels great to be ordering
everyone around again.

642
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:31,199
Branch, look!

643
00:39:31,279 --> 00:39:32,368
They're alive?

644
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:35,037
And on a silver platter, too.
We were both right.

645
00:39:35,117 --> 00:39:37,332
And to mark the occasion,
Your Highness, look.

646
00:39:37,412 --> 00:39:39,918
I found your old Troll bib.

647
00:39:39,998 --> 00:39:41,541
Wow! I bet you still fit.

648
00:39:45,128 --> 00:39:46,755
Like a glove!

649
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,016
You think that's funny?

650
00:39:52,096 --> 00:39:54,852
We'll see who's laughing
when I bite your yummy head off.

651
00:39:54,932 --> 00:39:57,060
When I bite all y'alls yummy heads off.

652
00:39:58,812 --> 00:39:59,733
Wait a minute.

653
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:03,399
Chef, this isn't enough yummy heads
to feed all of Bergen Town.

654
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:07,575
How are we supposed to have Trollstice
if there's not enough Trolls?

655
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,785
There's plenty more
where that came from, sire.

656
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,245
Are you sure?

657
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,749
- Because I promised everyone a Troll.
- No, no, no, sire!

658
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:15,292
Everything will be fine.

659
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:17,003
If I were truly worried...

660
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,255
Would I be willing to do this?

661
00:40:19,335 --> 00:40:20,378
Creek!

662
00:40:23,965 --> 00:40:25,303
My first Troll!

663
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:27,639
Go on, eat, King Gristle.

664
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:30,681
Enjoy a taste of true happiness.

665
00:40:37,314 --> 00:40:38,858
Shouldn't we wait for Trollstice?

666
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:43,404
Sire, every day is Trollstice
when you have Trolls.

667
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:49,077
Yeah, I guess.

668
00:40:52,248 --> 00:40:54,417
But my dad said
the first time should be special.

669
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:58,717
Well, you're the king now.

670
00:40:58,797 --> 00:41:00,716
Yeah, I am the king.

671
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,809
But I think I should share this moment
with all the kingdom.

672
00:41:06,889 --> 00:41:07,849
Eat it!

673
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:10,980
- Oh, my God!
- No!

674
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,020
Yes!

675
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:22,783
Idget, lock these Trolls in your room
and guard them with your life.

676
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:25,327
Yes, Chef.

677
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:27,667
Yes. Yes, I know.

678
00:41:27,747 --> 00:41:28,960
Branch, we have to save him!

679
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,837
Save him from what? His stomach?

680
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:32,423
We didn't see him chew.
We didn't see him swallow!

681
00:41:32,503 --> 00:41:35,050
Face it, Poppy. Sometimes people
go into other people's mouths...

682
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,176
And they don't come out.

683
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,052
If we go after Creek now,
we're going to get eaten.

684
00:41:39,511 --> 00:41:40,724
I'm sorry...

685
00:41:40,804 --> 00:41:42,222
But it's too late for him.

686
00:41:50,147 --> 00:41:50,981
Poppy!

687
00:42:19,223 --> 00:42:21,183
Scullery maid!

688
00:42:23,978 --> 00:42:26,734
Wash these pots and pans for Trollstice.

689
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:28,737
The king's inviting everyone.

690
00:42:28,817 --> 00:42:30,193
Except you.

691
00:42:51,843 --> 00:42:57,099
<i>I've been alone with you inside my mind</i>

692
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:03,273
<i>And in my dreams I've kissed your lips</i>

693
00:43:04,024 --> 00:43:06,777
<i>A thousand times</i>

694
00:43:07,569 --> 00:43:13,035
<i>I sometimes see you pass outside my door</i>

695
00:43:15,245 --> 00:43:16,330
<i>Hello</i>

696
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:22,587
<i>Is it me you're looking for?</i>

697
00:43:23,296 --> 00:43:26,761
<i>I can see it in your eyes</i>

698
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:30,012
<i>I can see it in your smile</i>

699
00:43:31,347 --> 00:43:34,017
<i>You're all I've ever wanted</i>

700
00:43:34,935 --> 00:43:38,735
<i>And my arms are open wide</i>

701
00:43:38,815 --> 00:43:40,695
<i>'Cause you know just what to say</i>

702
00:43:40,775 --> 00:43:42,947
You're all the idiots!
I have to do everything myself.

703
00:43:43,027 --> 00:43:44,949
<i>And you know just what to do</i>

704
00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:47,160
I have to get out of bed, I'm supposed to put
my own clothes on, tie my own shoes.

705
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,536
<i>And I want to tell you so much</i>

706
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:54,082
<i>I love you</i>

707
00:44:07,096 --> 00:44:08,810
She's in love with the king.

708
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:11,813
What are you talking about?
Bergens don't have feelings.

709
00:44:11,893 --> 00:44:13,983
Maybe you don't know everything
about the Bergens.

710
00:44:14,063 --> 00:44:15,439
Now let's go.

711
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:23,827
- Guys!
- Poppy!

712
00:44:23,907 --> 00:44:27,206
<i>Celebrate good times, come on</i>

713
00:44:27,286 --> 00:44:29,414
<i>It's a celebration</i>

714
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:33,881
<i>There's a party going on right here</i>

715
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:36,839
No! There is not a party
going on right here.

716
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:41,098
The sooner we get you guys out of here...

717
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,766
The sooner we can save Creek!

718
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:43,680
What?

719
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,557
Hello?

720
00:44:47,225 --> 00:44:49,270
Is it me you're looking for?

721
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,654
I know you're looking for the cupcakes
and rainbows here...

722
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:55,364
But let's face it, Creek's been eaten.

723
00:44:55,444 --> 00:44:56,865
They put him in a taco!

724
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,326
It was horrible.

725
00:44:58,406 --> 00:45:00,241
Sorry, Poppy. Creek's gone.

726
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:05,583
Poppy, how could you possibly
think Creek's still alive?

727
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:09,839
I don't think he's alive.
I hope he's alive, and that's enough.

728
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:12,341
How do you always look on the bright side?

729
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:14,177
There is no bright side here. None!

730
00:45:14,257 --> 00:45:15,721
There's always a bright side.

731
00:45:15,801 --> 00:45:17,928
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

732
00:45:21,974 --> 00:45:24,018
Glitter! No! Get back in your cage!

733
00:45:26,646 --> 00:45:28,607
Chef's gonna be so mad!

734
00:45:29,399 --> 00:45:30,192
No!

735
00:45:33,028 --> 00:45:34,614
Bridget, stop!

736
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,325
You're in love with King Gristle.

737
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,454
I don't know what you're talking about.

738
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,501
Excuse me!

739
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,753
That's not mine.

740
00:45:52,592 --> 00:45:54,098
What does it matter?

741
00:45:54,178 --> 00:45:56,559
It's not like he even knows I'm alive.

742
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:59,063
Bridget, I can help you!

743
00:45:59,143 --> 00:46:01,687
What if there was a way
we could both get what we want?

744
00:46:02,271 --> 00:46:03,942
You love Gristle, too?

745
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:07,025
You'd better back off, girlfriend!

746
00:46:09,821 --> 00:46:11,493
No. Bridget, no.

747
00:46:11,573 --> 00:46:15,456
That Troll King Gristle put in his mouth,
that's Creek.

748
00:46:15,536 --> 00:46:17,872
And I would do anything to save him.

749
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:19,878
<i>The only problem is...</i>

750
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:22,544
<i>We can't get anywhere near the king
without him eating us.</i>

751
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,011
But...

752
00:46:28,091 --> 00:46:29,510
You can.

753
00:46:29,969 --> 00:46:32,972
You can walk right up to him
and tell him how you feel.

754
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:34,770
As if.

755
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:37,022
I can't just walk right up to the king.

756
00:46:37,102 --> 00:46:41,528
His royal awesomeness would never
talk to a scullery maid like me.

757
00:46:41,608 --> 00:46:44,030
What if he didn't know
you were a scullery maid?

758
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:46,529
What if he thought
you were this total babe?

759
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:50,704
What kind of total babe
would be dressed like a scullery maid?

760
00:46:50,784 --> 00:46:51,956
I smell like gravy.

761
00:46:52,036 --> 00:46:54,709
- What if we made you a new outfit?
- I'm thinking...

762
00:46:54,789 --> 00:46:55,877
Jumpsuit!

763
00:46:55,957 --> 00:46:58,965
What's the point of a jumping suit
if I still have this hair?

764
00:46:59,045 --> 00:47:00,133
We can fix that.

765
00:47:00,213 --> 00:47:02,760
What's the point of a new outfit
and new hair...

766
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,471
If I don't even know what a total babe
would ever say?

767
00:47:05,551 --> 00:47:06,677
We can help with that too!

768
00:47:07,053 --> 00:47:08,015
Really?

769
00:47:08,095 --> 00:47:09,309
What do you say, Bridget?

770
00:47:09,389 --> 00:47:12,976
You get us Creek,
and we'll get you a date with the king.

771
00:47:17,232 --> 00:47:18,278
Let's do it?

772
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:19,989
A 5, 6, 7, 8...

773
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:22,700
<i>When you look in the mirror
let it disappear</i>

774
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,077
<i>All your insecurities</i>

775
00:47:25,157 --> 00:47:25,866
Wait!

776
00:47:26,283 --> 00:47:27,868
Why isn't this one singing?

777
00:47:28,118 --> 00:47:29,332
Come on, Branch.

778
00:47:29,412 --> 00:47:30,625
Sing with us!

779
00:47:30,705 --> 00:47:32,753
Yeah, Branch, sing with us!

780
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:33,962
No. That's okay.

781
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:35,757
You don't think this will work?

782
00:47:35,837 --> 00:47:37,925
No, no. It's not that. I just don't sing.

783
00:47:38,005 --> 00:47:39,553
- Branch!
- No.

784
00:47:39,633 --> 00:47:42,014
He's right. This idea is stupid.

785
00:47:42,094 --> 00:47:44,304
King Gristle will never love me.

786
00:47:44,888 --> 00:47:46,890
Come on. Hey, hey. What's all this?

787
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,398
That's right, Bridget.
Just let it all out.

788
00:47:50,478 --> 00:47:53,026
Bridget, let it go. Just have a good cry.

789
00:47:53,106 --> 00:47:54,023
Go, girl!

790
00:47:55,818 --> 00:47:57,823
Okay, now bring it back in.

791
00:47:57,903 --> 00:47:58,904
Reel it in.

792
00:48:00,407 --> 00:48:01,995
Branch, what are you doing?

793
00:48:02,075 --> 00:48:04,664
- You have to sing!
- I told you, I don't sing.

794
00:48:04,744 --> 00:48:06,833
- You have to!
- I'm sorry. I can't.

795
00:48:06,913 --> 00:48:08,835
- No, you can. You just won't.
- Fine. I just won't.

796
00:48:08,915 --> 00:48:10,004
- You have to!
- No!

797
00:48:10,084 --> 00:48:11,005
- Yes!
- No!

798
00:48:11,085 --> 00:48:12,590
Why not? Why won't you sing?

799
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,506
Because singing killed my grandma, okay?

800
00:48:16,216 --> 00:48:18,135
Now, leave me alone.

801
00:48:21,181 --> 00:48:24,267
My uncle broke his neck tap dancing once.

802
00:48:28,646 --> 00:48:31,859
How did singing kill your grandma?

803
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,821
What song was she singing?

804
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:37,532
I was the one singing.

805
00:48:39,577 --> 00:48:43,126
<i>And I need you now tonight</i>

806
00:48:43,206 --> 00:48:46,587
<i>And I need you more than ever</i>

807
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:50,300
<i>That day, I was so lost in song...</i>

808
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,511
<i>I didn't hear my grandma
trying to warn me.</i>

809
00:48:52,591 --> 00:48:54,138
Branch! Watch out!

810
00:48:54,218 --> 00:48:57,684
<i>And we'll only be making it right</i>

811
00:48:57,764 --> 00:48:59,600
Watch out, Branch!

812
00:49:08,484 --> 00:49:10,403
Grandma!

813
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:23,172
<i>Once upon a time
there was light in his life</i>

814
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:26,800
<i>But now there's only love in the dark</i>

815
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,882
<i>Nothing he can say</i>

816
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:34,222
<i>A total eclipse of the heart</i>

817
00:49:37,393 --> 00:49:39,311
I haven't sung a note since.

818
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:44,362
I'm so sorry, Branch. I had no idea.

819
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:47,407
I just assumed you had a terrible voice.

820
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:51,117
No, no, it was like an angel's.

821
00:49:51,701 --> 00:49:54,537
At least, that's what grandma used to say.

822
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:03,134
Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing? It's not hug time.

823
00:50:03,214 --> 00:50:05,633
I just thought you could use one.

824
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:16,066
Okay. Okay, I'll help.

825
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,273
But I'm still not singing.

826
00:50:18,899 --> 00:50:22,073
Okay, people. Hair we go!

827
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:27,158
<i>You</i>

828
00:50:28,618 --> 00:50:32,581
<i>You gotta let it show</i>

829
00:50:35,043 --> 00:50:36,422
<i>I'm comin'</i>

830
00:50:36,502 --> 00:50:39,425
<i>I'm comin'</i>

831
00:50:39,505 --> 00:50:40,469
<i>All right</i>

832
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:41,342
<i>Out</i>

833
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:45,141
<i>I'm comin'</i>

834
00:50:45,221 --> 00:50:48,140
<i>I'm comin'</i>

835
00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:50,352
<i>Out</i>

836
00:50:51,937 --> 00:50:52,941
<i>I'm comin'</i>

837
00:50:53,021 --> 00:50:55,653
<i>Yo! I'm coming out like the sun after rain</i>

838
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:57,989
<i>Ready to shine no time to be playin'
feelin' good</i>

839
00:50:58,069 --> 00:51:00,993
<i>Gonna get get what I, what I want
gonna show every-Everybody</i>

840
00:51:01,073 --> 00:51:02,161
<i>How I, how I flaunt</i>

841
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:04,621
<i>Look at me now, my confidence is soaring</i>

842
00:51:04,701 --> 00:51:06,415
<i>Dudes be impressed
with the points I'm scoring like</i>

843
00:51:06,495 --> 00:51:07,624
<i>That ain't boring</i>

844
00:51:07,704 --> 00:51:09,293
<i>And it just don't quit
watch the king drop his jaw</i>

845
00:51:09,373 --> 00:51:10,712
<i>When I'm shaking my hips I'm saying</i>

846
00:51:10,792 --> 00:51:12,005
<i>She's coming out</i>

847
00:51:12,085 --> 00:51:13,173
<i>She's comin'</i>

848
00:51:13,253 --> 00:51:15,092
<i>It's time to take a stand</i>

849
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:20,136
<i>- And show the world that I'm comin' out
- She's comin' out</i>

850
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:27,063
No, no, no! It's all wrong!

851
00:51:27,143 --> 00:51:29,065
I'm the king who's
bringing back Trollstice.

852
00:51:29,145 --> 00:51:30,693
I need a bib to match.

853
00:51:30,773 --> 00:51:31,778
Yes, sire.

854
00:51:31,858 --> 00:51:33,488
- I look like a child in this one.
- Oh, sire!

855
00:51:33,568 --> 00:51:35,487
I need something elegant, sophisticated.

856
00:51:35,737 --> 00:51:37,993
You know, a man's bib.

857
00:51:38,073 --> 00:51:39,912
Oh, he's so beautiful.

858
00:51:39,992 --> 00:51:41,536
And so are you.

859
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,375
- He'll know that I'm just a scullery maid.
- No, no, no!

860
00:51:44,455 --> 00:51:45,919
I got to get out of here.

861
00:51:45,999 --> 00:51:49,088
I'll be right here for you, Bridget.
We all will.

862
00:51:49,168 --> 00:51:51,842
- You'll tell me what to say, right?
- Of course, I will.

863
00:51:51,922 --> 00:51:53,302
Of course, I will.

864
00:51:53,382 --> 00:51:54,758
Just wait until we get inside.

865
00:51:55,552 --> 00:51:58,016
Sire! I believe I have the perfect bib!

866
00:51:58,096 --> 00:52:00,853
It better be!
Trollstice is tomorrow night.

867
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:03,564
I mean, I look good.
But I have to look great.

868
00:52:03,644 --> 00:52:04,687
Right.

869
00:52:06,397 --> 00:52:08,232
It's got a wing-dingle on it!

870
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:11,281
Your majesty! Look at you!
Such a big, big boy.

871
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,654
I love it!

872
00:52:13,447 --> 00:52:15,703
I think you look fat.

873
00:52:15,783 --> 00:52:17,160
What?

874
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:20,334
P-H, phat. Then strike that pose.

875
00:52:20,414 --> 00:52:21,957
P-H, phat!

876
00:52:23,751 --> 00:52:25,756
Hot lunch!

877
00:52:25,836 --> 00:52:29,048
Total honesty from a total babe.

878
00:52:30,884 --> 00:52:32,719
And who might you be?

879
00:52:34,179 --> 00:52:35,388
Your name is...

880
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:37,228
- Lady!
- Glitter?

881
00:52:37,308 --> 00:52:38,855
- Sparkles!
- Seriously?

882
00:52:38,935 --> 00:52:41,939
My name is Lady Glittersparkles,
seriously.

883
00:52:42,564 --> 00:52:44,858
Well, my Lady Gittersparkles.

884
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:47,614
Would you care to join me
for an evening...

885
00:52:47,694 --> 00:52:50,284
At Captain Starfunkle's
Roller Rink and Arcade?

886
00:52:50,364 --> 00:52:51,703
Would I!

887
00:52:51,783 --> 00:52:52,787
Would I?

888
00:52:52,867 --> 00:52:54,539
Yes! You'd be delighted.

889
00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:56,622
Yes! You'd be delighted.

890
00:52:57,414 --> 00:52:58,919
Indeed, I would.

891
00:52:58,999 --> 00:53:00,922
When are you gonna ask him about Creek?

892
00:53:01,002 --> 00:53:03,925
We have to warm him up first.
Don't you know anything about romance?

893
00:53:04,005 --> 00:53:06,094
Of course! I'm passionate about it.

894
00:53:06,174 --> 00:53:07,012
Really?

895
00:53:07,092 --> 00:53:08,930
Don't you know anything about sarcasm?

896
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,309
I think I had a sarcasm once.

897
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:13,519
And I'll take one of everything, Bibbly.

898
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,562
Things are gonna get messy.

899
00:53:18,146 --> 00:53:21,317
Enjoy your pizza. Here's your tokens.

900
00:53:24,153 --> 00:53:26,409
So fancy.

901
00:53:26,489 --> 00:53:29,158
Good thing I brought my appetite.

902
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,719
You are fantastic!

903
00:53:45,386 --> 00:53:47,433
Bridget! Compliment him back!

904
00:53:47,513 --> 00:53:48,768
I like your back.

905
00:53:48,848 --> 00:53:51,271
No! I meant say something nice about him.

906
00:53:51,351 --> 00:53:52,728
But I do like his back.

907
00:53:55,188 --> 00:53:56,900
Poppy, help her.

908
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:58,401
Your eyes...

909
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:00,612
They're...

910
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:02,284
Ooh!

911
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,953
Your ears...

912
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:05,287
Your eyes...

913
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,789
- Ears...
- Nose!

914
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:07,832
- Skin!
- Neck!

915
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,124
Skin, neck, ears...

916
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,793
- Nose, face, back of your head.
- Are you okay?

917
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,212
<i>Your teeth</i>

918
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:13,547
Teeth.

919
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:15,799
What's going on? Are you making fun of me?

920
00:54:15,879 --> 00:54:16,964
Your eyes!

921
00:54:18,049 --> 00:54:19,137
They're like...

922
00:54:19,217 --> 00:54:21,386
Two pools, so deep...

923
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,144
I fear if I dive in...

924
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:27,601
I might never come up for air.

925
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:30,562
I might never come up for air.

926
00:54:32,315 --> 00:54:34,028
And your smile...

927
00:54:34,108 --> 00:54:36,157
The sun itself turns jealous...

928
00:54:36,237 --> 00:54:38,993
And refuses to come out
from behind the clouds...

929
00:54:39,073 --> 00:54:42,581
Knowing it cannot shine half as bright.

930
00:54:42,661 --> 00:54:45,956
I kinda do have a nice smile, don't I?

931
00:54:46,414 --> 00:54:48,500
Yes, you do.

932
00:54:52,171 --> 00:54:54,594
I can't believe I'm about to say this...

933
00:54:54,674 --> 00:54:56,180
Guys, she's going rogue!

934
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,183
But being here with you today...

935
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:03,268
Makes me realize
that true happiness is possible.

936
00:55:04,477 --> 00:55:05,857
Whoa.

937
00:55:05,937 --> 00:55:07,066
It is!

938
00:55:07,146 --> 00:55:10,775
True happiness is a lot closer
than you think.

939
00:55:11,777 --> 00:55:13,821
It's right here.

940
00:55:15,281 --> 00:55:16,870
That's pretty, I guess.

941
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,535
What do you think now?

942
00:55:19,828 --> 00:55:20,582
Creek?

943
00:55:20,662 --> 00:55:22,293
I knew he was alive!

944
00:55:22,373 --> 00:55:24,000
Mr. Dinkles, he's alive!

945
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:25,960
Oh, snap!

946
00:55:27,962 --> 00:55:29,338
You just talked!

947
00:55:31,466 --> 00:55:33,802
- I've been savoring this little guy.
- Help!

948
00:55:34,636 --> 00:55:35,557
Mercy!

949
00:55:35,637 --> 00:55:38,978
Tell me, my lady, will I be seeing you
at the Trollstice feast?

950
00:55:39,058 --> 00:55:41,562
Well, duh. I'll be working.

951
00:55:41,979 --> 00:55:42,900
It!

952
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,524
It. Working it. You know...

953
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,484
Workin' it.

954
00:55:48,277 --> 00:55:50,074
Yeah! You're not kidding, you will.

955
00:55:50,154 --> 00:55:52,285
Because you're gonna be there
as my plus one.

956
00:55:52,365 --> 00:55:54,579
- Really?
- Assuming you'll say yes?

957
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:56,039
- Yes!
- Yes!

958
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:56,958
Yes!

959
00:55:57,038 --> 00:56:00,044
Meantimes, maybe we should find
some other way to...

960
00:56:00,124 --> 00:56:01,713
Work up an appetite.

961
00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:04,796
Oh, yeah? What did you have in mind?

962
00:56:10,052 --> 00:56:11,053
Whoo!

963
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:23,568
Whoo!

964
00:56:23,818 --> 00:56:24,861
Whoo!

965
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,400
Your majesty.

966
00:57:00,277 --> 00:57:02,029
You seem to be having...

967
00:57:02,697 --> 00:57:04,202
Fun.

968
00:57:04,282 --> 00:57:05,286
I am!

969
00:57:05,366 --> 00:57:08,411
Meet the lovely Lady Glittersparkles.

970
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:15,586
You remind me of someone.

971
00:57:18,131 --> 00:57:21,137
She's gonna be my plus one.

972
00:57:21,217 --> 00:57:22,640
Oh, I see.

973
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:27,057
For a moment there I was concerned
you were changing the plan.

974
00:57:30,102 --> 00:57:32,484
Well, this won't be a problem at all,
Your Highness.

975
00:57:32,564 --> 00:57:34,819
I'll just get my worthless
scullery maid to get...

976
00:57:34,899 --> 00:57:36,822
Another place setting ready
for the lovely...

977
00:57:36,902 --> 00:57:40,159
Lady Glittersparkles.

978
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:41,870
Put her place setting next to mine.

979
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:44,331
I want her right by my side...

980
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:46,914
Hey! Lady Glittersparkles?

981
00:57:47,748 --> 00:57:49,458
Lady Glittersparkles!

982
00:57:51,585 --> 00:57:53,671
I'll see you at Trollstice, yeah?

983
00:58:01,263 --> 00:58:03,266
I miss you already.

984
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:04,684
Ow!

985
00:58:10,315 --> 00:58:12,071
I think the king really likes us.

986
00:58:12,151 --> 00:58:13,531
I know, right?

987
00:58:13,611 --> 00:58:15,947
That was the greatest day of my life!

988
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,532
Thanks, Poppy.

989
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:20,289
Thanks to all of you!

990
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:21,620
Even you, I guess.

991
00:58:22,997 --> 00:58:25,211
I just never thought something like that
could happen to me.

992
00:58:25,291 --> 00:58:26,963
And it just did!

993
00:58:27,043 --> 00:58:29,295
I'm so excited I could just scream.

994
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:35,010
I could scream too! Creek is alive!

995
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,443
Branch, what's wrong?

996
00:58:45,523 --> 00:58:47,778
Nothing. I thought we were celebrating.

997
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,280
That's your happy shout?

998
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,823
It's been a while.

999
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:54,119
Well, you're gonna have plenty of practice,
because we're gonna save Creek...

1000
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:56,580
And life will be all
cupcakes and rainbows again.

1001
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:57,749
Up top!

1002
00:58:57,829 --> 00:58:58,917
Too slow.

1003
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:00,418
- Yes!
- I knew it!

1004
00:59:00,498 --> 00:59:01,628
Okay, everybody...

1005
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:04,211
Let's go save Creek.

1006
00:59:04,712 --> 00:59:06,342
No! No! You can't leave.

1007
00:59:06,422 --> 00:59:09,345
Lady Glittersparkles is gonna be
the king's plus one at dinner.

1008
00:59:09,425 --> 00:59:10,804
The dinner where they're serving Troll?

1009
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:12,933
Yeah, I think we're gonna
have to skip that one.

1010
00:59:13,013 --> 00:59:15,852
No! No, you have to help me
be Lady Glittersparkles.

1011
00:59:15,932 --> 00:59:16,937
I need you.

1012
00:59:17,017 --> 00:59:19,482
You don't wanna pretend to be
someone you're not forever!

1013
00:59:19,562 --> 00:59:21,692
Then how about just for tomorrow?

1014
00:59:21,772 --> 00:59:23,362
Bridget, you don't need us anymore.

1015
00:59:23,442 --> 00:59:25,781
You and the king
can make each other happy!

1016
00:59:25,861 --> 00:59:29,117
That's impossible!
Only eating a Troll can make you happy.

1017
00:59:29,197 --> 00:59:30,953
Everyone knows that!

1018
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:33,578
I wish I'd never gone on this stupid date!

1019
00:59:35,913 --> 00:59:36,876
Bridget...

1020
00:59:36,956 --> 00:59:40,464
Just go! Get out of my room.
Leave me alone.

1021
00:59:40,544 --> 00:59:41,465
Please, listen.

1022
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:42,968
Bridget!

1023
00:59:43,048 --> 00:59:44,344
- We've gotta go.
- Bridget...

1024
00:59:44,424 --> 00:59:45,971
What's going on down there?

1025
00:59:46,051 --> 00:59:48,849
Bridget, scrub that dish!

1026
00:59:48,929 --> 00:59:51,685
The king's bringing a plus one.

1027
00:59:51,765 --> 00:59:52,767
Yes, Chef.

1028
01:00:01,443 --> 01:00:03,324
We can do this, Barnabus.

1029
01:00:03,404 --> 01:00:06,950
I just have to lose 30 pounds
in the next eight hours.

1030
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:25,680
There it is!

1031
01:00:28,849 --> 01:00:30,938
<i>I feel good, I feel good</i>

1032
01:00:31,018 --> 01:00:32,523
<i>I feel good, I feel good</i>

1033
01:00:32,603 --> 01:00:35,691
<i>I feel good</i>

1034
01:00:36,441 --> 01:00:38,364
Creek, we'll have you
out of there in a second.

1035
01:00:38,444 --> 01:00:40,280
- Hurry!
- It's stuck!

1036
01:00:42,115 --> 01:00:42,950
Run!

1037
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:50,958
<i>I feel love</i>

1038
01:00:54,212 --> 01:00:56,339
Hey, guys! Over here!

1039
01:00:57,716 --> 01:00:58,804
- Everyone, get in!
- Let's go.

1040
01:00:58,884 --> 01:01:00,097
- Branch, give him to me.
- Go!

1041
01:01:00,177 --> 01:01:01,682
Just go!

1042
01:01:01,762 --> 01:01:03,098
Everybody hold on!

1043
01:01:06,768 --> 01:01:08,604
Hold it steady, guys.

1044
01:01:11,023 --> 01:01:12,862
Satin, Chenille, sharp right!

1045
01:01:12,942 --> 01:01:13,860
Let's do it!

1046
01:01:18,616 --> 01:01:20,204
Guy Diamond, glitter him!

1047
01:01:20,284 --> 01:01:22,119
Eat glitter!

1048
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:27,626
Look!

1049
01:01:28,752 --> 01:01:29,461
Hold on!

1050
01:01:33,799 --> 01:01:34,925
Creek!

1051
01:01:42,976 --> 01:01:44,145
Branch!

1052
01:01:48,149 --> 01:01:49,150
We got you!

1053
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:03,167
Gotcha!

1054
01:02:08,714 --> 01:02:10,136
No!

1055
01:02:10,216 --> 01:02:12,221
He can't be gone.

1056
01:02:12,301 --> 01:02:14,600
I'm sorry, Poppy. We're too late.

1057
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,642
Actually...

1058
01:02:15,722 --> 01:02:18,643
Your timing is perfect.

1059
01:02:23,691 --> 01:02:27,781
Sorry, but I can't have you leaving
before tomorrow's dinner.

1060
01:02:27,861 --> 01:02:29,905
A dinner to which you are all invited.

1061
01:02:30,406 --> 01:02:31,785
And when I say all...

1062
01:02:31,865 --> 01:02:34,998
I mean every Troll in Troll Village.

1063
01:02:35,078 --> 01:02:37,414
You'll never find them.
Not where they're hiding.

1064
01:02:38,874 --> 01:02:41,631
You're right. I couldn't find them.

1065
01:02:41,711 --> 01:02:44,548
But I could with someone they know.

1066
01:02:45,048 --> 01:02:46,883
Someone they trust.

1067
01:02:48,385 --> 01:02:49,428
Someone...

1068
01:02:50,554 --> 01:02:51,975
Like this guy.

1069
01:02:52,055 --> 01:02:54,103
Creek! You're alive!

1070
01:02:54,183 --> 01:02:55,313
He's so cool.

1071
01:02:55,393 --> 01:02:56,394
Yes!

1072
01:02:57,895 --> 01:02:59,610
He's selling us out!

1073
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:00,861
Branch! Wait!

1074
01:03:00,941 --> 01:03:04,404
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation.
At least give him a chance.

1075
01:03:04,738 --> 01:03:06,114
Thank you, Poppy.

1076
01:03:06,948 --> 01:03:08,533
I'm selling you out.

1077
01:03:10,785 --> 01:03:12,454
No, stop! No, wait!

1078
01:03:14,915 --> 01:03:16,917
You better explain yourself, Creek!

1079
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,509
As I was about to accept my fate...

1080
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:23,513
I had, what I can only describe as...

1081
01:03:23,593 --> 01:03:26,137
A spiritual awakening.

1082
01:03:26,638 --> 01:03:27,805
I don't wanna die!

1083
01:03:28,431 --> 01:03:29,644
Don't eat me.

1084
01:03:29,724 --> 01:03:33,566
Eat someone else. Anyone else.
Everyone else. But not me!

1085
01:03:33,646 --> 01:03:35,859
But the king wants to be happy now.

1086
01:03:35,939 --> 01:03:39,114
Wait! Wait! There must be some other way.

1087
01:03:39,194 --> 01:03:41,613
I'll do anything.

1088
01:03:45,409 --> 01:03:49,500
No! Creek, please don't do this.

1089
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,793
Believe me...

1090
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:55,507
I wish there was some other
me-not-getting-eaten way.

1091
01:03:55,587 --> 01:03:57,297
But there isn't.

1092
01:03:57,881 --> 01:04:01,389
And now I have to live with this
for the rest of my life.

1093
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:04,640
At least you get to die
with a clear conscience.

1094
01:04:05,224 --> 01:04:06,809
So, in a way...

1095
01:04:07,434 --> 01:04:09,356
You could say...

1096
01:04:09,436 --> 01:04:11,313
I'm doing this for you.

1097
01:04:15,735 --> 01:04:16,778
Boop!

1098
01:04:24,621 --> 01:04:28,333
Listen. It's Poppy's cowbell!

1099
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:30,380
My baby did it!

1100
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,170
Poppy did it!

1101
01:04:35,466 --> 01:04:36,759
Creek?

1102
01:04:43,642 --> 01:04:44,853
Uh-oh.

1103
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:55,323
Trollstice! Trollstice! Trollstice!

1104
01:05:06,794 --> 01:05:08,880
Now let's prepare the main course.

1105
01:05:10,381 --> 01:05:12,633
The Trolls!

1106
01:05:22,854 --> 01:05:24,523
Poppy?

1107
01:05:25,024 --> 01:05:28,948
Poppy! Thank goodness you're all right.

1108
01:05:29,028 --> 01:05:30,908
I'm doing great.

1109
01:05:30,988 --> 01:05:34,368
I got everybody I love thrown in a pot.
Thanks for asking.

1110
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:39,332
Poppy? Are you being...

1111
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:42,043
Sarcastic?

1112
01:05:42,377 --> 01:05:43,503
Yes!

1113
01:05:44,546 --> 01:05:45,714
Oh, my God!

1114
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,970
I'm sorry.

1115
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:50,177
I don't know why
I thought I could save you.

1116
01:05:53,055 --> 01:05:57,147
All I wanted to do was keep everyone safe,
like you did, Dad.

1117
01:05:57,227 --> 01:05:58,853
But I couldn't.

1118
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,731
Poppy.

1119
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:05,404
I let everyone down.

1120
01:06:09,741 --> 01:06:11,368
But, Poppy...

1121
01:06:11,994 --> 01:06:13,829
You were right, Branch.

1122
01:06:14,414 --> 01:06:17,250
The world isn't all cupcakes and rainbows.

1123
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:30,849
Poppy.

1124
01:08:07,127 --> 01:08:10,797
<i>You with the sad eyes</i>

1125
01:08:19,933 --> 01:08:23,311
<i>Don't be discouraged</i>

1126
01:08:40,832 --> 01:08:43,543
<i>Oh, I realize</i>

1127
01:08:44,878 --> 01:08:47,631
<i>It's hard to take courage</i>

1128
01:08:48,507 --> 01:08:51,806
<i>In a world full of people</i>

1129
01:08:51,886 --> 01:08:55,060
<i>You can lose sight of it all</i>

1130
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:57,479
<i>The darkness inside you</i>

1131
01:08:57,559 --> 01:09:01,105
<i>Can make you feel so small</i>

1132
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:29,016
What are you doing? The king is waiting.

1133
01:09:29,096 --> 01:09:30,225
Get those Trolls out there!

1134
01:09:30,305 --> 01:09:31,393
Sorry, Chef.

1135
01:09:31,473 --> 01:09:32,808
Oh, you are sorry.

1136
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:45,034
<i>Show me a smile then</i>

1137
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:49,994
<i>Don't be unhappy, can't remember when</i>

1138
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:54,878
<i>I last saw you laughing</i>

1139
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:57,795
<i>This world makes you crazy</i>

1140
01:09:58,379 --> 01:10:01,595
<i>And you've taken all you can bear</i>

1141
01:10:01,675 --> 01:10:04,389
<i>Just call me up</i>

1142
01:10:04,469 --> 01:10:07,518
<i>'Cause I will always be there</i>

1143
01:10:07,598 --> 01:10:11,689
<i>And I see your true colors</i>

1144
01:10:11,769 --> 01:10:14,567
<i>Shining through</i>

1145
01:10:14,647 --> 01:10:18,822
<i>I see your true colors</i>

1146
01:10:18,902 --> 01:10:23,116
<i>And that's why I love you</i>

1147
01:10:26,996 --> 01:10:30,252
<i>So don't be afraid</i>

1148
01:10:30,332 --> 01:10:33,297
<i>To let them show</i>

1149
01:10:33,377 --> 01:10:36,969
<i>Your true colors</i>

1150
01:10:37,049 --> 01:10:42,096
<i>True colors are beautiful</i>

1151
01:10:45,809 --> 01:10:49,566
<i>I see your true colors</i>

1152
01:10:49,646 --> 01:10:51,690
<i>- Shining through
- True colors</i>

1153
01:10:52,066 --> 01:10:56,449
<i>I see your true colors</i>

1154
01:10:56,529 --> 01:10:59,494
<i>That's why I love you</i>

1155
01:10:59,574 --> 01:11:02,331
<i>So don't be afraid</i>

1156
01:11:02,411 --> 01:11:05,669
<i>To let them show</i>

1157
01:11:05,749 --> 01:11:09,339
<i>Your true colors</i>

1158
01:11:09,419 --> 01:11:12,342
<i>True colors</i>

1159
01:11:12,422 --> 01:11:17,011
<i>Are beautiful</i>

1160
01:11:18,429 --> 01:11:22,393
<i>Like a rainbow</i>

1161
01:11:25,312 --> 01:11:29,317
<i>Like a rainbow</i>

1162
01:11:50,842 --> 01:11:51,884
Thank you!

1163
01:11:52,385 --> 01:11:54,599
No. Thank you.

1164
01:11:54,679 --> 01:11:55,809
For what?

1165
01:11:55,889 --> 01:11:58,729
For showing me how to be happy.

1166
01:11:58,809 --> 01:12:01,438
Really? You're finally happy?

1167
01:12:02,063 --> 01:12:03,022
Now?

1168
01:12:03,314 --> 01:12:05,195
I think so.

1169
01:12:05,275 --> 01:12:07,907
Happiness is inside of all of us, right?

1170
01:12:07,987 --> 01:12:11,073
Sometimes, you just need someone
to help you find it.

1171
01:12:13,576 --> 01:12:16,583
What's gonna happen now, Princess Poppy?

1172
01:12:16,663 --> 01:12:17,748
I don't know.

1173
01:12:18,123 --> 01:12:20,960
But I know we're not giving up.

1174
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,013
No.

1175
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:29,928
This is it, Mr. Dinkles. This is it.

1176
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,358
Poppy!

1177
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:39,442
Bridget?

1178
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:40,902
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

1179
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:42,738
What are you doing?

1180
01:12:42,818 --> 01:12:44,031
I can't let them eat you.

1181
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:45,366
- But...
- Come on!

1182
01:12:45,446 --> 01:12:46,785
You gotta go!

1183
01:12:46,865 --> 01:12:49,079
Hurry! Go, go, go! Get out of here!

1184
01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:52,374
No! Bridget, if you go in there without us,
you know what they'll do.

1185
01:12:52,454 --> 01:12:53,542
I know.

1186
01:12:53,622 --> 01:12:54,623
But, Bridget...

1187
01:12:54,956 --> 01:12:55,874
It's okay.

1188
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,170
It's okay, Poppy.

1189
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:03,550
You showed me what it feels like
to be happy.

1190
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:07,889
I never would have known
if it wasn't for you.

1191
01:13:09,808 --> 01:13:12,352
And I love you for that.

1192
01:13:13,019 --> 01:13:14,646
I love you too, Bridget.

1193
01:13:15,855 --> 01:13:17,149
Bridget!

1194
01:13:19,485 --> 01:13:21,575
Go on, now. You have to hurry!

1195
01:13:21,655 --> 01:13:22,743
Come with us.

1196
01:13:22,823 --> 01:13:24,578
And make it easier for them to find you?

1197
01:13:24,658 --> 01:13:27,081
No way! You have to go. Now!

1198
01:13:27,161 --> 01:13:28,371
Bridget!

1199
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,056
Bye, Poppy.

1200
01:13:50,688 --> 01:13:54,525
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

1201
01:13:59,865 --> 01:14:00,827
Wait!

1202
01:14:00,907 --> 01:14:04,203
Chef, shouldn't we
wait for Lady Glittersparkles?

1203
01:14:06,038 --> 01:14:07,461
You are absolutely right.

1204
01:14:07,541 --> 01:14:10,464
Now, everyone, there will be
no Trolls until...

1205
01:14:10,544 --> 01:14:12,841
The king's plus one has arrived.

1206
01:14:12,921 --> 01:14:14,256
Boo!

1207
01:14:14,882 --> 01:14:16,805
We've waited long enough!

1208
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:18,056
Unless...

1209
01:14:18,136 --> 01:14:19,474
Unless, what?

1210
01:14:19,554 --> 01:14:22,353
Well, unless she doesn't come at all.

1211
01:14:22,433 --> 01:14:25,978
But that's crazy talk.
Who wouldn't wanna be with you?

1212
01:14:32,944 --> 01:14:33,945
Yeah.

1213
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:36,034
Maybe we should start.

1214
01:14:36,114 --> 01:14:37,992
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

1215
01:14:38,242 --> 01:14:39,744
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

1216
01:14:41,412 --> 01:14:44,545
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls! Yeah!

1217
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:46,673
Go! Come on. Hurry!

1218
01:14:46,753 --> 01:14:48,049
Come on. Everybody, let's go.

1219
01:14:48,129 --> 01:14:49,923
No Troll left behind!

1220
01:14:50,381 --> 01:14:51,966
Watch your step.

1221
01:14:59,725 --> 01:15:00,935
Poppy?

1222
01:15:03,105 --> 01:15:06,194
Bridget just ruined her life to save ours.
It's not right!

1223
01:15:06,274 --> 01:15:08,778
She deserves to be happy as much as we do.

1224
01:15:10,613 --> 01:15:12,156
They all do!

1225
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:18,455
All right, everybody.
Who's ready to eat Trolls?

1226
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:20,711
King Gristle...

1227
01:15:20,791 --> 01:15:23,882
There is only one thing
that will ever make you happy...

1228
01:15:23,962 --> 01:15:26,799
And only one Bergen who can provide it.

1229
01:15:27,675 --> 01:15:29,135
<i>Bon appetit!</i>

1230
01:15:31,095 --> 01:15:32,099
They're gone!

1231
01:15:32,179 --> 01:15:33,139
Gone?

1232
01:15:33,472 --> 01:15:34,518
They're gone?

1233
01:15:34,598 --> 01:15:35,519
Idget...

1234
01:15:35,599 --> 01:15:36,772
What did you do?

1235
01:15:36,852 --> 01:15:37,978
You ate them!

1236
01:15:38,353 --> 01:15:40,901
You greedy, greedy pig.

1237
01:15:40,981 --> 01:15:42,236
No! I...

1238
01:15:42,316 --> 01:15:43,359
She ruined Trollstice!

1239
01:15:44,444 --> 01:15:46,446
Guards, lock her up!

1240
01:15:48,824 --> 01:15:50,284
Let's get her!

1241
01:16:27,034 --> 01:16:28,495
Lady Glittersparkles?

1242
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:30,997
What?

1243
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:36,297
But how? Why?

1244
01:16:36,377 --> 01:16:37,838
Why did you do this?

1245
01:16:38,422 --> 01:16:41,637
Because she didn't think you would
want someone like her.

1246
01:16:41,717 --> 01:16:43,306
I mean, hello?

1247
01:16:43,386 --> 01:16:45,642
Is it me you're looking for?

1248
01:16:45,722 --> 01:16:47,683
I don't think so.

1249
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:50,853
Guards, finish her!

1250
01:16:52,021 --> 01:16:52,855
No.

1251
01:16:53,689 --> 01:16:54,610
Wait!

1252
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:58,490
King Gristle, when you were with Bridget,
you were feeling something, weren't you?

1253
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:01,618
Yeah, I was.
I just thought it was too much pizza.

1254
01:17:01,698 --> 01:17:02,954
Me, too.

1255
01:17:03,034 --> 01:17:06,416
That feeling? That was happiness.

1256
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:07,501
What?

1257
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:10,129
But you have to eat a Troll to be happy.

1258
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:11,922
Everyone knows that!

1259
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:12,923
Don't you?

1260
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:16,135
But King Gristle's never eaten
a Troll in his life, right?

1261
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:18,051
No, I haven't.

1262
01:17:18,385 --> 01:17:20,512
Yet, here I am.

1263
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:22,849
My belly empty...

1264
01:17:23,516 --> 01:17:25,518
And my heart full.

1265
01:17:28,397 --> 01:17:29,398
Don't listen to her!

1266
01:17:29,857 --> 01:17:31,653
There's only one way to be happy.

1267
01:17:31,733 --> 01:17:32,946
My way!

1268
01:17:33,026 --> 01:17:33,822
No!

1269
01:17:33,902 --> 01:17:35,112
With me in charge...

1270
01:17:36,196 --> 01:17:39,367
I'll serve you Troll
every day of the year.

1271
01:17:40,535 --> 01:17:42,541
With me as queen...

1272
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:45,749
All of life will be a never-ending
feast of happiness!

1273
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:47,839
Come on, eat!

1274
01:17:47,919 --> 01:17:49,087
Eat!

1275
01:17:51,256 --> 01:17:52,090
No!

1276
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:56,556
Happiness isn't something you put inside.

1277
01:17:56,636 --> 01:17:58,476
It's already there.

1278
01:17:58,556 --> 01:18:02,188
Sometimes you just need someone
to help you find it.

1279
01:18:02,268 --> 01:18:03,649
Can I really be happy?

1280
01:18:03,729 --> 01:18:05,567
- I want to be happy!
- And me!

1281
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:06,732
And what about me?

1282
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:10,573
Do you really think I can be happy?

1283
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:11,741
Of course!

1284
01:18:11,821 --> 01:18:14,536
It's inside you! It's inside of all of us!

1285
01:18:14,616 --> 01:18:16,576
And I don't think it.

1286
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:18,370
I feel it!

1287
01:18:19,371 --> 01:18:23,463
<i>I got this feeling inside my bones</i>

1288
01:18:23,543 --> 01:18:27,088
<i>It goes electric wavy when I turn it on</i>

1289
01:18:28,466 --> 01:18:31,552
<i>And if you want it inside your soul</i>

1290
01:18:32,136 --> 01:18:35,727
<i>Just open up your heart
let music take control</i>

1291
01:18:35,807 --> 01:18:38,647
<i>I've got that sunshine in my pocket</i>

1292
01:18:38,727 --> 01:18:41,233
<i>Got that good soul in my feet</i>

1293
01:18:41,313 --> 01:18:44,317
<i>I feel that hot blood in my body
when it drops</i>

1294
01:18:45,151 --> 01:18:49,493
<i>I can't take my eyes up off it
moving so phenomenally</i>

1295
01:18:49,573 --> 01:18:51,328
<i>The room on lock the way we rock it</i>

1296
01:18:51,408 --> 01:18:53,039
<i>So don't stop</i>

1297
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:57,418
<i>Under the lights, when everything goes</i>

1298
01:18:57,498 --> 01:19:00,672
<i>Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close</i>

1299
01:19:00,752 --> 01:19:01,840
<i>Can't stop, won't stop</i>

1300
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,094
<i>When we move well you already know</i>

1301
01:19:05,174 --> 01:19:06,429
<i>Let's go, let's work</i>

1302
01:19:06,509 --> 01:19:10,681
<i>So just imagine,
just imagine, just imagine</i>

1303
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:14,938
<i>Nothing I can see but you
when you dance, dance, dance</i>

1304
01:19:15,018 --> 01:19:19,149
<i>Feel the good-good creeping up on you
so just dance, dance, dance, come on</i>

1305
01:19:19,691 --> 01:19:23,741
<i>All those things I shouldn't do
but you dance, dance, dance</i>

1306
01:19:23,821 --> 01:19:27,745
<i>And ain't nobody leaving soon
so keep dancing</i>

1307
01:19:27,825 --> 01:19:29,453
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1308
01:19:29,953 --> 01:19:31,625
<i>So just dance, dance, dance</i>

1309
01:19:31,705 --> 01:19:34,086
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1310
01:19:34,166 --> 01:19:35,796
<i>So just dance, dance, dance</i>

1311
01:19:35,876 --> 01:19:38,257
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1312
01:19:38,337 --> 01:19:39,926
<i>So just dance, dance, dance</i>

1313
01:19:40,006 --> 01:19:41,382

01:19:42,383 --> 01:19:45,012
<i>So keep dancing, come on</i>

1315
01:19:51,561 --> 01:19:53,730
<i>Yeah, I can't stop the...</i>

1316
01:19:55,523 --> 01:19:56,736
My eyes!

1317
01:19:56,816 --> 01:19:57,654
Let's do it!

1318
01:19:57,734 --> 01:19:58,694
<i>I can't stop the...</i>

1319
01:20:01,322 --> 01:20:03,032
<i>I can't stop the...</i>

1320
01:20:05,994 --> 01:20:07,746
<i>I can't stop the...</i>

1321
01:20:09,916 --> 01:20:11,838
<i>I can't stop the... I can't stop the...</i>

1322
01:20:11,918 --> 01:20:13,506
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1323
01:20:13,586 --> 01:20:15,755
<i>Nothing I can see but you
when you dance, dance, dance</i>

1324
01:20:16,255 --> 01:20:17,343
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1325
01:20:17,423 --> 01:20:20,347
<i>Feel the good creeping up on you
so just dance, dance, dance</i>

1326
01:20:20,427 --> 01:20:21,682
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1327
01:20:21,762 --> 01:20:24,644
<i>All those things I shouldn't do

1329
01:20:25,934 --> 01:20:29,191
<i>And ain't nobody leaving soon
so keep dancing</i>

1330
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:30,526
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1331
01:20:30,606 --> 01:20:33,112
<i>Got this feeling in my body</i>

1332
01:20:33,192 --> 01:20:34,530
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1333
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:37,533
<i>Got this feeling in my body</i>

1334
01:20:37,613 --> 01:20:39,036
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1335
01:20:39,116 --> 01:20:41,538
<i>Wanna see you move your body</i>

1336
01:20:41,618 --> 01:20:42,702
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1337
01:20:43,203 --> 01:20:46,290
<i>Got this feeling in my body, come on</i>

1338
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:49,962
Our new queen!

1339
01:20:54,383 --> 01:20:55,971
- Go, Queen Poppy!
- Way to go, Poppy!

1340
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:57,386
You did it!

1341
01:20:57,928 --> 01:20:59,517
Alright, Queen Poppy!

1342
01:20:59,597 --> 01:21:01,227
She's my friend! I know her!

1343
01:21:01,307 --> 01:21:03,021
<i>So just dance, dance, dance</i>

1344
01:21:03,101 --> 01:21:04,645
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1345
01:21:05,646 --> 01:21:07,568
<i>So just dance, dance, dance</i>

1346
01:21:07,648 --> 01:21:09,988
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

01:21:10,068 --> 01:21:12,487
<i>So keep dancing, come on</i>

1348
01:21:13,155 --> 01:21:17,159
I know it's not officially
hug time yet, but...

1349
01:21:17,742 --> 01:21:22,123
Now that I am queen,
I decree that hug time is all the time.

1350
01:21:24,334 --> 01:21:25,794
<i>I can't stop the...</i>

1351
01:21:28,506 --> 01:21:29,594
<i>I can't stop the...</i>

1352
01:21:29,674 --> 01:21:30,675
Up high!

1353
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:33,261
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1354
01:21:33,511 --> 01:21:34,557
Yeah! Yeah!

1355
01:21:34,637 --> 01:21:36,726
<i>Got this feeling in my body</i>

1356
01:21:36,806 --> 01:21:38,186
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1357
01:21:38,266 --> 01:21:42,354
<i>Got this feeling in my body, come on</i>

1358
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,118
<i>Do you remember</i>

1359
01:21:54,494 --> 01:21:57,330
<i>The 21st night of September</i>

1360
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:01,418
<i>Love was changing the minds of pretenders</i>

1361
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:05,715
<i>While chasing the clouds away</i>

1362
01:22:07,217 --> 01:22:09,348
<i>Our hearts were ringing</i>

1363
01:22:09,428 --> 01:22:12,515
<i>In the key that our souls were singing</i>

1364
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:14,934
<i>As we danced in the night</i>

1365
01:22:15,184 --> 01:22:20,607
<i>Remember how the stars
stole the night away</i>

1366
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:57,107
<i>The bell was ringing, oh</i>

1367
01:22:57,607 --> 01:23:01,074
<i>And our souls were singing</i>

1368
01:23:01,154 --> 01:23:06,869
<i>Do you remember never was a cloudy day, oh</i>

1369
01:23:37,737 --> 01:23:39,406
<i>Break it down for me</i>

1370
01:23:40,532 --> 01:23:42,826
<i>Say do you remember</i>

1371
01:23:43,702 --> 01:23:46,956
<i>Ooh, dancing in September</i>

1372
01:23:56,884 --> 01:23:58,677
<i>Do you remember</i>

1373
01:24:00,347 --> 01:24:03,019
<i>Dancing in September</i>

1374
01:24:03,099 --> 01:24:07,438
<i>And it never was a cloudy day</i>

1375
01:24:12,444 --> 01:24:13,570
<i>Come on</i>

1376
01:24:15,489 --> 01:24:18,242
<i>We're dancing in September</i>

1377
01:24:34,302 --> 01:24:36,012
But wait, wait, wait.
