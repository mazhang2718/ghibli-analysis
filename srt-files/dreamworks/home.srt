1
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,391
<i>Today is best day ever.</i>

2
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,555
<i>Moving Day!</i>

3
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,261
For who?

4
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,806
<i>Answer: The Boov.</i>

5
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,145
<i>Who are the Boov?</i>

6
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:01,483
<i>Answer: Best species ever at running away.</i>

7
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,945
<i>All Boov settlers, please report
to your assigned transport.</i>

8
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,404
<i>You are allowed one carry-on.</i>

9
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,410
Excusing me. Sorries.

10
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,822
Excusing me.
Pardon the me, friend.

11
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,490
Boov do not friend.

12
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:13,619
Owpain!

13
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,783
Uh-oh. Sorries.

14
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,624
<i>Who am I?
I am Oh.</i>

15
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,960
<i>I has been given this name
by my many, many friends.</i>

16
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,459
- Good morning!
- Oh.

17
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,751
- Hi, guys.
- Oh.

18
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,918
- Hello.
- Oh.

19
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,849
<i>I am very excitement
to make a new fresh start!</i>

20
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:38,312
<i>We are all moving to best planet ever
for to hiding.</i>

21
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,608
<i>Our new home!</i>

22
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,205
Captain Smek!

23
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,873
My fellow Boov!

24
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,788
I has saved us again.

25
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,372
A bit lower.

26
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,545
No, stop!

27
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,709
Up a bit. Up a bit.

28
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,129
Perfect. Walk away. Walk away.

29
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,547
My fellow...

30
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,548
My...

31
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,383
fellow...

32
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,178
Boov.

33
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,806
Good news!

34
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,559
Thanks to my leadership skills...

35
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,570
cowering, running
and pulling a skedaddle...

36
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,402
we are safe from our enemy...

37
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,907
the Gorg.

38
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,820
Nasty.

39
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,168
Give Daddy some sugar!

40
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,830
Captain Smek has saved us again!

41
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,752
We are now arrived at the best
hiding place yet in the Milky Way.

42
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,421
And the Gorg are lactose intolerant.

43
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,260
Genius!

44
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,766
They will never find us here.

45
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,264
Thank you!

46
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,766
Best of yet...

47
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,273
this planet is full of great stuff.

48
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,106
Look at these delicious fruits!

49
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,531
That makes me feel so good.

50
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,368
What fun at a party!

51
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,949
Boov do not party.

52
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,372
Also, this planet is inhabited.

53
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,703
But do not worry.

54
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,290
The native savages are
simple and backwards.

55
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,087
They are so ugly, they are cute!

56
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,049
Everything you need to know about them
can be found...

57
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,214
in these comprehensive pamphlets.

58
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,804
Comprehensive pamphlet.
Comprehensive pamphlet.

59
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,311
They are lucky the Boov have come.

60
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,143
All right, Boov. Invade on three.

61
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,397
One, two, three.

62
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,652
<i>Rejoice, humanspeople!
The Boov are arrived!</i>

63
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,446
<i>Now we are turning off
your gravity temporarily...</i>

64
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,082
<i>so as to make your mandatory
relocation easier.</i>

65
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,743
<i>And more fun!</i>

66
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,627
<i>So, what is up?</i>

67
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,212
<i>You are!</i>

68
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,562
You'll never catch me!

69
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,901
<i>Enjoy you the frozen, sweetened
bovine secretion...</i>

70
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,063
<i>as we take this short flight
to Happy Humanstown.</i>

71
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,257
This is so cool! Come on!

72
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:54,927
<i>Fa-da!</i>

73
00:04:55,086 --> 00:05:00,013
<i>Humanspersons are happiness and joy forever
in Happy Humanstown.</i>

74
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,972
Welcome to your new home.

75
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,058
- Wait, what? No!
- New home?

76
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,815
<i>And rest of planet is for Boov.</i>

77
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,145
<i>Win-win!</i>

78
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,565
<i>Welcome, Boov settlers.</i>

79
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,825
<i>All humans have been relocated.</i>

80
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,610
<i>Your homes are now ready.</i>

81
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,120
Thanking you!

82
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,706
<i>This planet may be
a bit of a fixing-it-upper...</i>

83
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,120
<i>but that is okay.</i>

84
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,837
<i>Boov are best at deciding what is useful.</i>

85
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,250
<i>And what is not.</i>

86
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,668
Owpain.

87
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,004
Step aside. Clean-up crew.

88
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,297
<i>Useless.</i>

89
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,601
<i>Today, I starts a new life.</i>

90
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,987
<i>With new friends. In a new home.</i>

91
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,450
<i>Residents may now enter sector 179.</i>

92
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,609
That is me!

93
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:04,156
<i>And that is why today is best day ever!</i>

94
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,348
Welcome home, neighbors!

95
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,479
Boov do not have "neighbors."

96
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,727
That is owing to the size
and topography of our former planet.

97
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,155
Hey! Can I borrowing a cup of sugar?

98
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,533
What?

99
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,955
But now, our closer proximity
can leads to friendship.

100
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,952
You are all invited...

101
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,243
to my warming of house party.

102
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,504
Say, 5:00?

103
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:53,914
Sure.

104
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,664
Yes!

105
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:03,033
<i>Hey, Pig! Be careful up there!</i>

106
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,150
I'm sorry, Pig.

107
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,782
Mom's not here.

108
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,071
It's just a video.

109
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,957
<i>Hey, Mom.
I think Pig wants to join us.</i>

110
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,077
<i>It's not funny!</i>

111
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:14,785
<i>Tip!</i>

112
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,788
<i>Come on, Mom.
It's just snow.</i>

113
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,423
<i>I don't know anything about snow.</i>

114
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,084
<i>We're from Barbados!
We don't have snow!</i>

115
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:24,962
<i>Are you okay?</i>

116
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,757
<i>I'm sending this to everyone.</i>

117
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,360
<i>Sector 195 is ready for occupation.</i>

118
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,281
We can't wait for Mom, Pig.
We gotta go.

119
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:51,947
Right now!

120
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,811
Oh, no!

121
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,247
<i>Prepare for your dance attack!</i>

122
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,012
Okay, let's go find Mom.

123
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,050
Neighbors, hello!

124
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,967
Please come in and...

125
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,852
Hello.

126
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,393
Hello?

127
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,975
And right. And left. Other left.

128
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,233
Kyle!

129
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:26,977
Right. No, left.

130
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,821
Hello, friend Kyle.

131
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,278
I am not your friend.

132
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,490
Of course you are.
We have had many enjoyable talks.

133
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,827
No, we talk only because
I'm not allowed to move.

134
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,333
You are always saying the funny things.

135
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:44,291
Perhaps you can say them
at my warming of house party tonight.

136
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:48,709
I will not. Parties are useless
and take up valuable Boov time.

137
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,628
Since you are at your busyness,
I shall send an e-vite to you...

138
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,013
so you can join later
during your leisure minute.

139
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,300
Please do not send.
I enjoy my leisure minute.

140
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,470
Fa-da! I have sent directions
to my living space.

141
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,189
<i>Fa-da! I have sent directions
to my living space.</i>

142
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,728
You sent directions to everyone?

143
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,192
What?
It is not my fault.

144
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,283
Whyfor put "send" button
right next to "send all"?

145
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,951
This is just bad design.

146
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,160
Your invite has been sent
to entire galaxy!

147
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,657
Uh-oh.

148
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,417
"Uh-oh" is right!

149
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,045
Our enemy, the Gorg, will receive it...

150
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,798
and can use directions for to find us!

151
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,254
The Gorg?

152
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,221
<i>Fa-da!</i>

153
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,809
You have doomed our species!

154
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:45,769
No, please.

155
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,105
I did not mean to.
I am sorries!

156
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,815
You are arresting!

157
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,150
No!

158
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,985
I was just trying to invite you to my...

159
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,993
Security has been compromised.

160
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,870
Arrest that Boov!

161
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,371
Autopilot, I needs help!

162
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,878
<i>Help is available in Paris
at Boov Headquarters.</i>

163
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,380
No, Autopilot!
Any place but Paris!

164
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,883
You must takes me to a place
with no Boovs.

165
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,883
<i>The only remaining spot on planet
with no Boov is Antarctica.</i>

166
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:18,969
Group hug!

167
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,887
Yes! Antarctica is perfect!
Take me there now!

168
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,849
<i>I am sorry. You are fugitive Boov.</i>

169
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,518
<i>Initiating Self-Destruct.</i>

170
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,357
No! Do not initiate!

171
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,816
I am not a fugitive!

172
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,244
No!

173
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,693
Oh, no.

174
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,518
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!

175
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,276
Whatfor are you did this?

176
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,530
I am Boov, beloved by all humans.

177
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,190
I know what you are.

178
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,859
Excellent! Can I come into the out now?

179
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,448
No, you cannot "come into the out" now.

180
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,989
You can never come into the out,
ever again!

181
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,166
But I can!

182
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,203
You are just having
to take away the piece of wood.

183
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,877
Then I will have to...

184
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,215
I will shoot forth the lasers
from my eyeballs!

185
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,638
You can do that?

186
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,511
Yes.

187
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,724
If you shoot your eye lasers,
then I'll have no choice...

188
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,392
but to explode your head!

189
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,311
- You humans cannot to explode...
- We can too!

190
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,821
We just don't much.

191
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,196
It's considered rude.

192
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,322
Then I am granting you a truce.

193
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,487
You are not to exploding heads...

194
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,577
and I will not do my
devastating eye lasers.

195
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,707
Okay. Truce.

196
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,588
- So, can I come into the out now?
- No!

197
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,672
This is what you get
for stealing planets and abducting people.

198
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,427
You are thinking a mistake.

199
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,884
Boov do not steal and abduct.

200
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,891
No, Boov liberate and befriend.

201
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,433
Guess who made this one!

202
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,348
This is so beautiful!

203
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,185
Mom! What's happening?

204
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,444
I don't know, honey.

205
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,105
Tip!

206
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,450
It will be okay.

207
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,741
<i>Lifeform detected. Not human.
Move along.</i>

208
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,626
<i>Enjoy you the frozen, sweetened
bovine secretion...</i>

209
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,129
<i>as we take this short flight
to Happy Humanstown.</i>

210
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,963
Mom!

211
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,424
It's all your fault.

212
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,759
You stole my mom!

213
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,637
Smell ya later, Boov.

214
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,427
Wait! Smell me now!

215
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,980
I can to fixing your car.
I seen you has broken it.

216
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,812
I didn't break it.
I'm a very good driver.

217
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,444
It's supposed to leak like that.

218
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,794
Can I come into the out now?

219
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:03,838
<i>I know the fugitive Boov has made
yet another in a series of horrible...</i>

220
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,174
<i>yet unintentionally humorous mistakes.</i>

221
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,590
<i>But let me reassure you,
the signal he broadcast...</i>

222
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,973
<i>is being handled.</i>

223
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,512
We are definitely not doomed.

224
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,811
- And we're out.
- We are doomed!

225
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,142
The Gorg are going to find us again!

226
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,528
The maniac Boov has ruined everything.

227
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,780
This is bad.

228
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,156
And I really love this planet.

229
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,572
Look at all the great stuff they've got.

230
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,991
Like this! A headband!

231
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,207
And for evening wear, you slide it down...

232
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,087
you got a beautiful spare tire.

233
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,246
I love it!

234
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,544
Very nice!

235
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,335
Who would wanna leave this behind?
I have got to fix this.

236
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,836
I know!

237
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,005
Summon the Big Brain Boovs.

238
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,345
The smarty-pants
of all smarty panty Booviness.

239
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,426
Gentleboov...

240
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,391
I want ideas.

241
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,433
We could create an alternate reality
with no Gorg in it...

242
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,352
then go live there.

243
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,737
Yes! I love it!

244
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,148
How long would that take?

245
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,316
Based on our current technology...

246
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,861
1.7 million years.

247
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,781
That's a lot of years, Toni.
Moving on!

248
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,995
- We could lay on the ground...
- Yes!

249
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,332
And make the Gorg think we are dead.

250
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,590
Next!

251
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,677
What if we logged into
the fugitive Boov's email...

252
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,132
and cancelled his e-vite...

253
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,765
Shush! Or we could log into
the fugitive Boov's email...

254
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,643
and cancel his invitation, and...

255
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:38,890
What was that?

256
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,600
So the Gorg never receive it.

257
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,099
So the Gorg never receive it!

258
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:47,236
Now, type in the password
and cancel that message.

259
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,865
It was a good idea of me
to make all passwords "password."

260
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,115
It's so easy to remember.

261
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,372
It did not work! His password is unique.

262
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:58,784
No!

263
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:02,327
Unique?
Boov are not unique!

264
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,996
Fetch me my inhaler.

265
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,879
Boy, that works.

266
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,298
His mistaking is leading the Gorg
right to us.

267
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,636
Show me his invite.

268
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,261
<i>You are all invited to a party!</i>

269
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,600
<i>Just head to the Milky Way.</i>

270
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,014
<i>Turn right at the Big Dipper.</i>

271
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,477
<i>Third planet from the Sun.</i>

272
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,984
<i>Look for my balloons!
Party!</i>

273
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,775
<i>Come if you like to have fun!</i>

274
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,780
<i>My best friend Kyle will be there!</i>

275
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,657
<i>Kyle, Kyle, Kyle!</i>

276
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,066
<i>Come party!</i>

277
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,365
Kyle!

278
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,576
He is not my friend.

279
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,867
The internet does not lie!

280
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,750
You know him, you can find him.

281
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,411
I am putting you in charge!

282
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,218
But, Captain, it is not my job.
I am only a mid-level traffic Boov.

283
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,549
- I admire your cowardice, Officer.
- Thank you.

284
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:55,009
But I want every Boovcop on Planet Smekland
searching this city.

285
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,759
We need his password...

286
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,142
or we will all be destroyed by the Gorg!

287
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,301
Find him!

288
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:05,473
That Boov has made his final mistake.

289
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,807
Fa-da!

290
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,726
You were supposed to fix it!

291
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,019
What is this?

292
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,280
I calls it "Slushious."

293
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:33,917
"Slushious"?

294
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,302
It makes excellent fuel...

295
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,088
and comes in fun-to-say flavors.

296
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:38,505
"Grape Escape."

297
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,761
"Tangerine Twist."

298
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,176
"Busta Lime"!

299
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,511
Mom's gonna kill me.

300
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:48,649
Now I am prepared to accept one of your
traditional gestures of human gratitude.

301
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,153
Actually, our tradition is to punch you
in the nose. Hold still.

302
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,530
No! Your gratitude is implied.

303
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,283
You can drives first.

304
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,819
Then I can...

305
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,157
You're not coming.

306
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,823
I'm trying to hide from the Boov.
I'm not bringing one with me.

307
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,206
You'll just turn me in.

308
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:07,414
No! I just needs a ride!

309
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,750
I haves official Boov business
out of in town.

310
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:11,913
Me, too.

311
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,091
But I fixes your car!

312
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,469
So? I let you out of the freezer.
We're even.

313
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,609
- What did you do to my car?
- What doos you mean?

314
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,236
It should to hover much better now.

315
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,239
It's a car.
It didn't hover at all before.

316
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,947
How do you stop this thing?

317
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:56,293
Oops. I have apparently reversing
the proceed and anti-proceed controls.

318
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,836
Yeah, I noticed.
Stop is go.

319
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,797
- Go is stop.
- Wait!

320
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:04,137
Whyfor you do this?
Boovs and humans are friends!

321
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,723
We're not friends.
You kidnapped my mom!

322
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,982
Who is Mimom?

323
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,233
No, "my" mom!

324
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,735
What did I say?

325
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,317
- I knows how to find her.
- How?

326
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,032
That information is at
Boov Central Command.

327
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,867
- At the Great Antenna.
- What?

328
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,283
In Paris! Now let me to inside!

329
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,575
Paris.

330
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,745
- Then promise.
- What?

331
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,506
Promise you'll help me find her
or I'm leaving your Boov butt.

332
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:41,254
I promise! But if you do not wish
to be capturing, it must be now!

333
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,017
Fine. Get in.

334
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,915
<i>Oui, oui,</i> Pig!
Paris, here we come.

335
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,743
We're gonna find out
where they put Mom.

336
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:34,398
Okay. I shall set the GPS
to take us straight to the Paris.

337
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,233
<i>Destination entered: Antarctica.</i>

338
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,980
Hey, what are you doing?

339
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,111
How did that happen?

340
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,947
Keep your Boov paws off my car!

341
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,616
Whoa!

342
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,371
Your vehicle is infested.

343
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,457
It's not infested. He's my pet.

344
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,963
His name is Pig. Don't touch him.

345
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,624
Now he is vibrating.

346
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,383
Is he going to explode?

347
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,544
No! He's just purring.

348
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,008
Why do you haves this thing?

349
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,299
Is it useful? Does it give meat or milk?

350
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,138
What? No!

351
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,645
You just have pets for fun
and companionship.

352
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:16,398
You has me for companion on the ship.

353
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,685
Yeah, well, Pig is better.

354
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,319
If cat is "Pig," what is your name?

355
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,167
Gratuity Tucci.
But my friends call me "Tip."

356
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,174
- Tip.
- I said "my friends."

357
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,336
But we are friends.
All humans and Boov.

358
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,004
Captain Smek has decided.

359
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,263
Captain Smek is an idiot.

360
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,178
Untrue!

361
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,220
Captain Smek is genius
and best at running away.

362
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:58,016
Have you not heard
the legend of the Shusher?

363
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,436
<i>Long ago, our enemy, the Gorg...</i>

364
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,277
<i>invited the Boov to a peace meeting.</i>

365
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,498
<i>But Smek wisely fled in terror.</i>

366
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,500
<i>And he took a great trophy: the Shusher.</i>

367
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,876
Run away!

368
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,836
<i>Why is it called the "Shusher"?</i>

369
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:24,624
Shush!

370
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:26,843
Whatever.

371
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,842
Seriously?

372
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,721
You guys had to ruin the Statue Of Liberty?

373
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,878
"Statue of Smek."

374
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,847
You will not get away with this.

375
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,257
Boov Patrol!

376
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,555
They are looking for you!

377
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,717
Oh, no.

378
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,067
Oh, no!

379
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,828
What's that?

380
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:40,867
Hey!

381
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,337
Don't distract the driver!

382
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,423
Aha! Busta Lime.

383
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:57,305
"Busta Lime."

384
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,561
Owpain!

385
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:04,771
Owpain.

386
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,658
Okay. Pee break.

387
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,202
I, too, has to break pee.

388
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,961
Or, as you calls it, the "number one."

389
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,122
- We also has the "number two."
- Okay.

390
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,166
- And the "number three."
- Okay!

391
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,381
It is a good thing I doos not
have to go the number three.

392
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,170
It would not be safe for you.

393
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,714
We only doos it once a year.

394
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,258
I would not call it a holiday...

395
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,893
- but you doos need to take the day off.
- That's enough!

396
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,982
You can't come in here.
This is the girls' room.

397
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,406
Do not eat the blue mints!

398
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,749
Thankfully, there is a
large bowl of lemonade.

399
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,462
Do not drink the lemonade!

400
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,249
Be out in a second.

401
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,009
We're going to Paris!

402
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,803
Going to see my mom!

403
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,350
Takes your time!

404
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,853
Ant-arc-tica.

405
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,186
Here I come!

406
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,352
Fugitive Boov.

407
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,864
Hold still for arresting!

408
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,524
Best friend Kyle!

409
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,034
I am not your friend!

410
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,741
But I will be a hero Boov
for getting your password.

411
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:44,825
Yes! You has in nick-time saved us!

412
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,000
What is the purpose of your face?

413
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,456
Owpain.

414
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,044
You were gonna ditch me?

415
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,207
- No!
- Liar!

416
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,710
I never lie!

417
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:55,876
Yes, you do!

418
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,342
And you know how I know?

419
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,883
Because every time you lie,
you turn green!

420
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,551
I doos not. I...

421
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,218
Poomp.

422
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:11,402
Open the door, you lying,
frog-faced squishy toy!

423
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,145
Stop! I need your...

424
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,157
You promised to help me find my mom!

425
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,818
Then I un-promise!

426
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,531
That's not how it works!

427
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,281
You have to help me get to Paris.

428
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,290
I will not!

429
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,794
Stop! I need your...

430
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,004
I must hide!

431
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,137
I am speaking the English at you.
Whyfor do you not understands me?

432
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:41,424
I "understands." I just don't care.

433
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,300
- Freezing!
- Look out!

434
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:52,892
Come on!

435
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,698
Stop! I need your password.

436
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:02,614
No!

437
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:03,778
Go!

438
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,675
All I wanted was his password.

439
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:32,225
This is not a sustainable friendship model.

440
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,217
So...

441
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:04,177
I assume by now
we have apprehended the fugitive.

442
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,008
Anybody?

443
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,097
You. The purple one.

444
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,844
Not that purple. The other purple.
The other purple.

445
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,391
That one.

446
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,392
Yes, you!

447
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,361
So, where is he?

448
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,025
We do not know, sir.

449
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,532
What? This is number one disaster!

450
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,035
His message must not reach the Gorg.

451
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,743
This planet was hard to find,
and I will not abandon it!

452
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:32,159
Someone fetch me my stress blankie.

453
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,756
So soothing.

454
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,761
Aha! Officer Kyle!

455
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,890
Now here is a Boov
who knows how to do his job.

456
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,267
Tell me, you have found the fugitive?

457
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,598
Yes.

458
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,637
Joyful exclamation!

459
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,775
And where is he?

460
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,316
There is a tiny problem.

461
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,322
"Tiny." As long as it's tiny, who cares?

462
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,617
Well, before I got the password...

463
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,412
I erased him.

464
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,415
<i>Come party. Come party. Come party.</i>

465
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,295
- Quit it!
- Sorry.

466
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,590
Look, Paris is danger for both of us.

467
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,804
It crawls with Boov.

468
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,015
Doos you have a plan
for once we are get there?

469
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,273
Not really. But I have hope.

470
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,605
You are bad at math.

471
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:39,518
Excuse me?

472
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,436
I got an "A" in geometry.

473
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:42,946
I am only saying...

474
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,607
Boov are superior in this way.

475
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:49,946
If probability for success
falls below 50%...

476
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,162
Boov give up. You do not.

477
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:55,324
Exactly!

478
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,669
Enough with the ripping!

479
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,124
Okay, Okay.

480
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,164
Tell you what. Let's have some tuneage.

481
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,219
What is that?

482
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,134
Boov song.

483
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,302
It is called "Motionless and Obedient."

484
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,469
Very big hit.

485
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,814
No, no, no! Not in my car.

486
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,350
Driver gets to pick.

487
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,985
This is not even music.
This is just noise.

488
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,997
Involuntary physical response.

489
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,584
You have tricked me into listening
to a debilitating sonic weapon.

490
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,716
If you want humans to not hate you...

491
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,252
you could start by liking
some of our stuff.

492
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,885
Confusion. What is happening to my body?

493
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,428
It's called dancing!

494
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,518
Boov do not dancing!

495
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,183
I can tell.
But you're getting the hang of it!

496
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,192
How long before this kills me?

497
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,945
I am not in control of my own extremities!

498
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,232
That's it. Work it!

499
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,695
I do not want it to work!

500
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:10,858
You know what?

501
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,199
"Boov" rhymes with "groove."

502
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,284
Shake your Boov thang.

503
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,037
It is shaking in a most undignified way!

504
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,371
Oh, no! My hands are in the air
like I just do not care!

505
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,627
This is not how a Boov behaves!

506
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,416
I am overheated with shame!

507
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,381
- I must cool my core!
- Wait!

508
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,966
- What are you doing?
- I will returning!

509
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:32,930
We were having fun!

510
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,716
Oh!

511
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,431
Oh?

512
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,740
<i>Come on, Mom. It's just snow!</i>

513
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,825
<i>I don't know anything about snow.</i>

514
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,157
<i>Our first snow!</i>

515
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,581
<i>Are you okay?</i>

516
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:03,916
<i>I'm sending this to-</i>

517
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,964
My temperature is back to happiness.

518
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:10,423
And to show I do not hold against you
any grudge-ment...

519
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,179
I have brought you delicious snacking.

520
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,432
Fa-da! Chewy plastic rings!

521
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,642
I really do not enjoy
your human gratitude customs.

522
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:21,930
Where have you been?

523
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,269
You were gone forever!

524
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,104
That is not accurate. "Forever" is...

525
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,485
I thought you were dead! Or hurt!

526
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,612
Or I don't know!

527
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,524
But you cannot just leave
someone alone like that!

528
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,659
Put yourself in my shoes!

529
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,536
How could I wears your shoes?

530
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:37,992
My pods are too small.

531
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,371
It's an expression!

532
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,785
It means try to feel how
someone else feels.

533
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:46,876
I'm just a kid. I'm not supposed to be
by myself all the time.

534
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,793
This is child endangerment.
Which is a crime, by the way.

535
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,462
But when I founded you,
you were already alone...

536
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,380
so I thinks it is normal for you.

537
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,050
When Boov are young,
we are kept in the warming oven.

538
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,816
Is this normal for humanspersons?

539
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:11,981
Usually, we don't cross the Atlantic
by ourselves until we're 16.

540
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,320
No, none of this is normal!

541
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,361
Don't you get it?
You ruined everything!

542
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:21,748
I was finally happy here...
There, where I lived.

543
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,249
With my mom.

544
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,036
Do you know how hard it was
for me to fit in?

545
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,670
How long that took?

546
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,002
7th-grade girls are mean!

547
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,338
Yes, I sees that!
I did not realize!

548
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,845
We will resume the finding of Mimom.

549
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,722
Stop saying that!

550
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,259
She's just "my" mom.

551
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,519
Not yours. Mine.

552
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,100
How do you not understand this?

553
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,767
How would you feel if some horrible aliens
took your mother from you?

554
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,861
That could not to happen.

555
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,022
Boov are not having mimoms.

556
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,905
Boov don't have families.

557
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,038
No wonder you take things
and don't care about anybody else.

558
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,879
So, your mimom...

559
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,882
is a very important humansperson to you.

560
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,715
More important than others.

561
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,927
To not belong with her
causes you being sad.

562
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,222
But recent moments ago,
you are kicking on me and yelling.

563
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:31,393
Which is seeming more to be
mad than sad.

564
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:35,610
Well, sometimes it's both.

565
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,197
So, you are sad-mad.

566
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:56,126
Humans are more complicated
than it said in the pamphlet.

567
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,309
I vacuumed here as fast as I could.

568
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,101
Whatfor is your plan for figuring out
the dumb Boov's password?

569
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,602
I got nothing!

570
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,894
Please, come on!
I need ideas!

571
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,062
You! The purple one.

572
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,609
Oh, come on!

573
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:22,777
So?

574
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:27,916
We could type in random
numbers and letters?

575
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,118
I like it!

576
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,960
Get those big brains
plugged in and working.

577
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,294
Away!

578
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,669
You know what the Gorg will do
if they find us.

579
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:39,927
Chomp, chomp, chomp.

580
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,597
<i>And that is why
we keep running away.</i>

581
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,135
Whoa.

582
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,184
Why do these Gorg hate you so much?

583
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,598
Because they are Gorg.

584
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,108
We calls Gorg the "takers"...

585
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:57,487
because if you has something,
they takes it.

586
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,443
Like, if you has a sandwich.

587
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:00,778
Or a planet.

588
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,783
No, no. I get it.

589
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,819
But they're not coming
to this planet, right?

590
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,533
Oh, no, no. Not to worry.

591
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:09,996
The Big Brain Boov will to fix my mistake.

592
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,001
But I will still be very punished.

593
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,787
We has a rule.

594
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,376
Nine mistakes and you are out.

595
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,337
How many mistakes do you have?

596
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,294
62.

597
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,142
When I'm stressed out,
my mom tells me jokes.

598
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,013
Boov do not do telling jokes.

599
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,977
It's not that hard.
I'll teach you.

600
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,139
Knock, knock.

601
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,356
You would say, "Who's there?"

602
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,859
You are there.

603
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,524
No, just ask me.

604
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,690
Who is there?

605
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,319
Now I say, "The interrupting cow."

606
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:49,365
Now you say, "The interrupting cow, who?"

607
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,531
Let's just do it.

608
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,996
- Knock, knock.
- Who is there?

609
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,911
The interrupting cow.

610
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:57,501
- The interrupting cow...
- Moo!

611
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,712
You did not let me finish my response.

612
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,878
- I was to say, "The interrupting co..."
- Moo!

613
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,591
You did it again.

614
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,554
That is the joke.

615
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,560
The cow is to being an interrupting cow...

616
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,721
and therefore interrupts me!

617
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,186
- I know. That's why it's funny.
- Moo!

618
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,942
- Let me fi...
- Moo!

619
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,821
- That's enough.
- I'm the interrupting cow.

620
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,399
- Knock it off!
- Moo!

621
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,610
- Don't make me get out more tape!
- Moo!

622
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,451
So many Boovs!

623
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,578
I said this was dumbness.

624
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,372
I said I am doomed.
But doos you listen? No!

625
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,539
Oh, that's enough!

626
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,424
You are driving me to the crazy!

627
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,803
It is never too late to run away.
That is the Boov motto.

628
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,765
Yes, but we're not doing that.
I have a plan.

629
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,927
Is your plan to run away?
Because other-way-wise, it is stupid!

630
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,891
All we have to do
is sneak into the city...

631
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,897
get into the Great Antenna,
use it to find my mom...

632
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,104
and then sneak out again. See?

633
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:02,316
But it still will not work
because my face is known.

634
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:06,949
If I am seen by any Boov,
I am 100% popular for being arrested.

635
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,282
What if I could fix that?

636
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,507
Hold still.

637
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,636
First, a little beauty mark.

638
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:32,968
Letting me see.

639
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,374
- Not yet. Give me that mirror.
- Give to me, give to me!

640
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,976
It is like looking at a completed stranger!

641
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,110
No, I'm not done. It's not even...

642
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,318
You are a worker of
miraculous transformation!

643
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:47,949
Who is this Boov?

644
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,529
I do not know!

645
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,868
All right, Oh.

646
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:55,323
Owpain.

647
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,511
<i>Express elevator departing.</i>

648
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,191
Whoa!

649
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,361
This is uber freaky.

650
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,031
These are the smartest Boov you have?

651
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,741
You must be very quiet.

652
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,628
You do not want to break their concentra...

653
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,588
<i>Come party. Come party.</i>

654
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,421
Oh! What is it?

655
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,587
I thought the Big Brain Boovs
would have stopped my invitation by now.

656
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,673
But they have still not
figured out my password.

657
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,273
- How is this possible?
- Wait a minute.

658
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:57,347
Does this mean those horrible monster
Gorg thingies will come to Earth'?

659
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,932
To Smekland, yes!

660
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,347
And what happens then?

661
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,851
There will be no finding of Mimom!

662
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,236
Then you've gotta fix this!

663
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,692
Yes.

664
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,190
Hurry!

665
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,109
By to the way, is your skull flexible?

666
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:14,072
- What?
- Never mind.

667
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,675
It will be probably okay.
Hold still.

668
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:29,963
Wow!

669
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,590
30 seconds to doom.

670
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,633
I shall input my password. It is...

671
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,601
"My name is Oh and Captain Smek is great
and anyone who does not think that is a poomp 1."

672
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,265
I wonder why no one guessed that.

673
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,558
I do not know.

674
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,815
- It didn't work?
- Impossible!

675
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:49,978
That is password!

676
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,235
That is...
Oh, no! Caps Lock.

677
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:00,654
Come on, come on, come on!

678
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,954
<i>Come party. Come party.
Come party. Come party.</i>

679
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,254
<i>Come party. Come party.</i>

680
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,801
Yes!

681
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,477
Fa-da! It has worked.

682
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:30,941
It worked!

683
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,320
You did it, Oh!

684
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,113
That was closeness.

685
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,276
On your feet.

686
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,162
You still have to find my mom.

687
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:43,370
That is simplicity.
We shall now searching on...

688
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,159
Lucy Tucci.

689
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,294
"Lucy Tucci."

690
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,881
Australia.

691
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,178
Observe Mimom.

692
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,177
That's not funny.

693
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,717
This is not your mimom?

694
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:01,883
Are you kidding?

695
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,345
That's not her!

696
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:05,896
Sure?

697
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,232
<i>I know, I know. Okay?</i>

698
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:09,911
<i>You've been saying that for two weeks.</i>

699
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,060
<i>Please!</i>

700
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:14,731
<i>She has big green eyes
and beautiful brown skin.</i>

701
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,023
Mom.

702
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,818
<i>So tell me where she is.</i>

703
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,908
<i>Or find me a Boov who can.</i>

704
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,323
<i>Please.</i>

705
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:28,586
Gratuity Tucci looks just like tiny Mimom.

706
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:32,378
Gratuity Tucci? Whyfor...

707
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,510
Thank you! Thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you!

708
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,056
I can't believe it!
My mom's in Australia!

709
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,596
And I has cancelled my e-vite!

710
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,764
I can finally come out of the hiding.

711
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:49,932
Yes!

712
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,120
Well, well, well.

713
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:06,540
Hello?

714
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,367
Hold my crown.

715
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,536
And be very careful.
It's the only one.

716
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,872
Well, well, well.

717
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,959
Did you really think you could escape?

718
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:19,470
Escape? No, no, no.

719
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,971
You see, I was just coming to tell you...

720
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,383
Despite your elaborate disguise...

721
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,598
the computer recognized you as...

722
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:29,105
the fugitive Boov!

723
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,731
But he's a hero Boov now!

724
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:37,488
Yes! I has fixed my mistake!

725
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,274
Yes, but before that,
you has made your mistake.

726
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,660
And many mistakes before that.

727
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:46,118
- Wait, I have not...
- Many, many, many, many!

728
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,280
Actually...

729
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,625
Many mistakes before that.

730
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,294
- So, I still has to erase you.
- Why?

731
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:54,653
You cannot guarantee
you would not make a mistake again.

732
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,633
- But I would not.
- But you might.

733
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:58,588
But I would not.

734
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,173
We could go round and round.
Let's do it again!

735
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:01,462
- But I would not.
- But you might.

736
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:03,427
- But I would not.
- I love this!

737
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,593
- But I would not!
- Bored now.

738
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,807
- But I would...
- Shush!

739
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:09,969
Erase him!

740
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,650
Drop the bubble guns!

741
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,153
Or I will mess with this...

742
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,446
gravity thingy.

743
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,857
She is bluffing.

744
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,947
She could not possibly reach
the gravity thingy.

745
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,204
Curse you and your tippy-toe tallness!

746
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,156
But no problem.

747
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:34,671
Boov technology is far too complicated
for simple humansgirl to figure out.

748
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,172
Excuse me?

749
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:40,836
This humansgirl got an "A" in geometry.

750
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:47,304
She figured it out!
Run for my life!

751
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,016
Out of my way! I am captain!

752
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,194
Grab on!

753
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,406
Oh, no! I can't hold you!

754
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,908
You weigh, like, a thousand pounds!

755
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:13,704
Let go.

756
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,711
- What?
- Trust me.

757
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,382
Sorry. It is my duty to run away first.

758
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:26,884
Poomp.

759
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,890
- What are you waiting for?
- I cannot touch.

760
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,551
It will not work if I drive it.

761
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,853
Fine. I'll drive.

762
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,517
Owpain.

763
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,157
You are terrible driver.

764
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:12,343
Come on.

765
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,728
Come on. Come on.

766
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,100
Bon appétit.

767
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:17,394
Oh, no, you don't!

768
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,058
I am not paying for that.

769
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,286
Come on, you stupid horse!

770
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,762
Whoo, that was cl...

771
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,307
This time I got you...

772
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,147
and you cannot escape.

773
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:03,985
<i>Fugitive Boov detected.</i>

774
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,144
I was wrong.

775
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,317
Jump!

776
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,444
Oh, no!

777
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:26,417
Look! I has found our car.

778
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:27,585
Pig!

779
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,180
I do not know whyfor you brought that.

780
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,019
We already hads food in the car.

781
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,183
It's not food, it's art.

782
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,690
Then it is bad.

783
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,981
Stars do not look like that.

784
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:49,524
It's not about how they look.

785
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,818
It's about how they feel.

786
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,785
They feel hot.

787
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,040
Okay, math whiz, how long
till we get to Australia?

788
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,371
17.9348 hours.

789
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,541
And then, Gratuity Tucci...

790
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,171
will see Mimom.

791
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,882
You hear that, Pig?

792
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,716
I can't wait to tell Mom
I actually went to Paris...

793
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,051
which you know she always wanted to do.

794
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,215
Maybe we could both come back here.

795
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,305
We do have a flying car now.

796
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:20,062
How do you say "cat" in French?

797
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,352
I think it's <i>"chat."</i>

798
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,652
What is the purpose of your face?

799
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:40,207
I has confusion.

800
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,416
I do not wish to be erased.

801
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,748
But maybe Captain Smek is right.

802
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:52,549
It is possible I will continue
making hilarious mistakes.

803
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,088
Probably.

804
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,256
That is not making me feel better.

805
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,096
Nobody's perfect.

806
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:02,604
My mom says your mistakes
are what make you human.

807
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:05,061
That is not what makes you Boov.

808
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,945
Gratuity Tucci...

809
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,106
before we came...

810
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,993
Captain Smek telled us
that the humans needed us.

811
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:19,329
That the humans were
just like the animals...

812
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,786
and that we could to make them better...

813
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,701
teach to them.

814
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:28,873
We were told the humans
were simple and backwards.

815
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,922
It is what we thought.

816
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,465
But I am thinking now...

817
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,307
that we were thinking wrong.

818
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,389
And that Captain Smek is the wrongest.

819
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:45,932
I am thinking the Boov
should never have come to Smekland.

820
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:48,442
To Earthland.

821
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:52,859
So I am saying
the sorry to you...

822
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,648
Gratuity Tucci.

823
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,785
Call me Tip.

824
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:15,090
It was a new home, a new country.

825
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,970
I tried to make friends at school...

826
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:20,975
but I was this nerd from Barbados.

827
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:24,182
But you dids to get
an "A" in geometry.

828
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,891
Yeah, I did.

829
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,357
I know when the other Boovs said "Oh"...

830
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,065
they were not happy to see me.

831
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:36,740
The true is, among Boov,
I do not fit in.

832
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,076
I fit out.

833
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,160
She is so amazing.

834
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,451
She saved up everything she had...

835
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:49,587
so we could move
and things would be better for us.

836
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:52,791
I cannot wait to meet Mimom.

837
00:54:57,753 --> 00:55:00,597
"My name is Captain Smek.
Shush, shush, shush."

838
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:06,263
"Boov technology is far too complicated
for simple humansgirl to figure out."

839
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:34,899
How did they find us?

840
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,310
I do not know!

841
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:45,031
Wait. They're not attacking.

842
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,241
Because they are running away.

843
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,827
Why are they running away?

844
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,742
There can only be one reason.

845
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:05,963
Gorg.

846
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:09,309
This makes no sense.
I stopped the message.

847
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,637
Gorg cannot to finding us.

848
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:13,643
Then how did they?

849
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,024
There must be some other reason!

850
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,939
Oh, behind us!

851
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,857
Engage weapons system.

852
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:25,526
We have a weapons system?

853
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:32,575
Go, Burrito Torpedo!

854
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,160
Yes!

855
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,833
We've been hit!
We're losing Grape Escape!

856
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,421
We lost Tangerine Twist!

857
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:45,633
If we lose Busta Lime, I cannot control!

858
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,589
Click and ticket.
We are to crash!

859
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:48,756
Oh!

860
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:07,566
No, no, no.

861
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,244
Slushious! No!

862
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,206
Don't just stand there! Help!

863
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,414
Come on, come on, come on!

864
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,920
Slushious! No!

865
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:26,962
She's gone.

866
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,130
We are doomed.

867
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,798
Now I'll never make it to Australia.

868
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,093
I will now sing the Boov Death Song.

869
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:41,981
A Gorg ship!

870
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,704
It is rude to interrupt the Death Song.

871
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,740
Maybe you could take the
parts from it to fix our car.

872
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:49,826
I cannot. Those are Gorg parts.
They are metric.

873
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:52,488
We're not getting this close
and giving up.

874
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,746
- Come on.
- No!

875
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,957
Always with the running towards danger.

876
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:59,495
Stop being such a Boov.
It's our only chance. Come on.

877
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:05,175
This has low probability of success!

878
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,637
- Let's go.
- Wait!

879
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:14,972
For what?

880
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:17,100
For you to change your mind.

881
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:18,430
Come on.

882
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:35,989
There's no pilot.

883
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,783
It is just a drone.

884
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,871
That could have been badness.

885
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,540
But we are not safety.

886
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,129
Gorg mothership will be here
soon enough.

887
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,674
Can you use any of this?

888
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,054
Broken.

889
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:53,340
Useless.

890
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,509
Likely to cause thermonuclear fission.

891
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,847
What is it?

892
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,306
It is Gorg super-chip!

893
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:05,360
Why is it called a super-chip?

894
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:06,691
It is mostly marketing.

895
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,526
But it is key...

896
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:12,363
for the Gorg are having machines
that are stronger and better at everything.

897
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,528
So we can never fight them with equaltude.

898
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,196
Can we use it to fix Slushious?

899
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,661
Yes, yes! The Slushious will fly again.

900
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:19,871
Yes!

901
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:31,591
It was low probability of success.

902
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,721
Some Boov you are.

903
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:36,507
Quickly.

904
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,514
We must fix the Slushious
and find Mimom.

905
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:39,724
"My" mom.

906
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,058
That is the thing I said.

907
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,519
I knew this would all work out!

908
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,611
You were awesome!

909
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:49,896
We're gonna find my mom...

910
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,907
you're gonna show everybody
the super-chip and be a big hero...

911
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,444
and even Captain Smek will have to...

912
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,578
That's a lot of people.

913
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:08,215
- Bye, Boov!
- Get lost!

914
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:24,644
Wow. You guys really are good
at running away.

915
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:25,807
Yes.

916
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,943
Yes, we are.

917
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:37,443
Look, over there!

918
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,112
That's where we saw my mom!

919
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:50,169
Hurry up, it is the last ship!

920
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,304
It's okay, Pig.
I'll be back with Mom.

921
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:01,175
We're almost there!

922
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:02,176
Over here.

923
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:03,269
- What?
- Hurry!

924
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:13,029
I don't understand.
She's in there?

925
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:16,649
Yes.

926
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:19,702
Tell me the truth.

927
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,204
There is no time.

928
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:22,990
You can come with me.

929
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,454
You will be safety.

930
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:30,293
My mom's not on that ship, is she?

931
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:35,339
You promised to help me find her,
and you're leaving?

932
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,721
- You lied to me.
- No!

933
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,974
A lie is a bad thing.

934
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,226
I did a thing so you can live.

935
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:45,854
I'm not going.
My mom is here.

936
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,355
You will never find her.

937
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:48,891
It is 100%.

938
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:51,526
Staying now does not make hope.

939
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,733
Gorg mothership will be here soon.

940
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:56,031
It destroys planets.

941
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:58,824
- We must run away now!
- No!

942
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,236
It is true.

943
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:03,872
Humanspersons cannot even understand
simple, simple things.

944
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,579
I am saving you!
I am being your friend.

945
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,210
No, you're just running away.

946
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,667
You don't leave your family.

947
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,110
But you can't understand that...

948
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,379
because you're just a Boov!

949
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,428
You've never been my friend.

950
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,220
Wait!

951
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,519
<i>Final escape pod departing.</i>

952
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:15,981
I hate upon the Gorg!
They are always finding us!

953
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:17,566
The Gorg mothership!

954
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:35,917
We are doomed!

955
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,081
Run away!

956
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,796
Make a path, I'm holding a baby.

957
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,764
It is the fugitive Boov!

958
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:50,975
He is running towards the danger!

959
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:52,305
Stop him!

960
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,492
Undo!

961
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:27,348
Captain, we are achieving
new highest speeds!

962
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:31,477
What has you done?
What is that thing?

963
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,809
It is Gorg super-chip.

964
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,305
What?

965
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,562
Gorg drone crashed...

966
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:39,022
and I ran to it
and I found the chip.

967
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:39,856
Enough.

968
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,862
You ran to a Gorg?

969
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,199
He runs towards the danger?

970
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,701
What kind of Boov is he?

971
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,830
He is like a Super Boov.

972
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:52,036
No, no, no.

973
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,825
He is not a Super Boov.

974
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:57,838
There is only one Super Boov
on this ship, and you know who it is.

975
01:05:57,996 --> 01:05:59,373
You're looking at him.

976
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,541
I invented running away.

977
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:05,008
And look at this.
I have the Shusher.

978
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:07,381
I am your captain.

979
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,049
But you are not good captain.

980
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,262
What?

981
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:13,770
You telled us these things,
and we all believed them.

982
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,722
I believed them.

983
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:19,393
But then I met a humansperson.

984
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,399
And she is not like you said.

985
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:26,863
She is brave and smart...

986
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:30,404
and cares about other humanspersons.

987
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:34,746
In a way that we Boov
do not even care about each other.

988
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,912
She even cares about me.

989
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:42,086
And I've done very little to earn that.

990
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,961
The Boov may be superior in many ways...

991
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,252
Yeah.

992
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:50,473
...but not in the ways that I now thinks
are most important.

993
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:56,145
Big deal!

994
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:57,556
I have had enough. Shush!

995
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:03,649
That is enough shushing.

996
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,654
How dare you shush a shushing!

997
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:08,612
Oh is right.
We need a new captain.

998
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:11,911
I thinks it should be Oh!

999
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,118
Me? No.

1000
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,748
No! He cannot be captain.

1001
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,160
I have the Shusher. I am captain!

1002
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:19,326
Not anymore!

1003
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,081
He will not know how to operate it!

1004
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:24,795
It is very complicated.

1005
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,438
Heavy on one end, light on the other.

1006
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,460
Shush!

1007
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:29,633
Booyah!

1008
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,632
No, I am not a Leader Boov.

1009
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,142
I makes far too many mistakes.

1010
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:37,436
You are not the only Boov
who makes mistakes.

1011
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,605
For examples...

1012
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:43,314
my mistake is not being your friend.

1013
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,486
All hail Captain Oh!

1014
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,280
I saw who did that!

1015
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:57,994
I hold grudges, you know!

1016
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,467
Oh, you're the best!

1017
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:10,129
Want me to host party, Oh?

1018
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,527
Go away.

1019
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:53,361
No, you are supposed to be saying
"Who is there?"

1020
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:54,866
Then I am to be saying...

1021
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,241
"Moo!"

1022
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:57,401
Oh!

1023
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,743
I can't believe it!

1024
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,950
But I saw your ship leave!

1025
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:09,960
But you came back!
What are you doing here?

1026
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:11,625
It is where I belongs.

1027
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:14,590
You and Pigcat are my friends.

1028
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,922
And alsos, too...

1029
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:18,965
I gave you a promise.

1030
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,222
He's my friend.

1031
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:46,727
Thank you.

1032
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,812
Mom.

1033
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,400
Tippy. My beautiful girl.

1034
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,237
I've been looking everywhere, Mom.

1035
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:03,027
I was so scared we'd never
see each other again.

1036
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:06,323
Mom, I never would have stopped looking
until I found you.

1037
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,416
They are still looking.

1038
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:30,930
Gorg are not the takers.

1039
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,266
Boov are.

1040
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:40,148
We must demonstrate our affections later.

1041
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,157
There is still one problem.

1042
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:44,114
Excuse me, what is that?

1043
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:47,121
That is Gorg mothership.
It is here to destroy the planet.

1044
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,688
It's going to destroy the planet?

1045
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:56,331
Yes. But I haves a plan.

1046
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:11,929
Oh?

1047
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,188
What are you doing?

1048
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,852
I am sorry.

1049
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:20,693
Tip cannot come into the out now.

1050
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:22,823
I am fixing my mistake.

1051
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:26,536
Oh! You can't do this on your own!

1052
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,412
Maybe not.

1053
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:30,619
But I haves hope.

1054
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:34,627
No!

1055
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:35,911
Stop, no!

1056
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,498
Please don't do this by yourself!

1057
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:45,759
No! Don't!

1058
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:48,178
Oh!

1059
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:10,071
Stop!

1060
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:15,368
Look!

1061
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:22,834
Hey!

1062
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:31,975
Gorg!

1063
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,804
It is useless to yell.

1064
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,314
Gorg!

1065
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,070
They're not gonna see him.

1066
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:48,405
It's not gonna work!

1067
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:50,323
Merry Christmas.

1068
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,954
- Now?
- Just open it.

1069
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:56,951
Thank you, sweetheart, but what...

1070
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:58,369
What are you doing?

1071
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:00,630
Distracting the driver.

1072
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:37,416
It worked! The ship's stopping!

1073
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,379
It's not gonna stop in time!

1074
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,809
Stop faster!

1075
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,845
He's gotta get out of there!

1076
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:01,516
Mom, help me with this thing!

1077
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:11,317
Oh!

1078
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:12,817
Oh!

1079
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,324
Run!

1080
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:15,283
Tip!

1081
01:16:15,446 --> 01:16:16,493
Stop!

1082
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:17,907
Tip!

1083
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:21,887
Mom!

1084
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:54,511
Oh!

1085
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:01,431
You're alive.

1086
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:03,938
But you scared me so bad!

1087
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,598
You were scared?

1088
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:07,858
I almost made a number three.

1089
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,017
Not too hard!

1090
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,604
It is still a possibility.

1091
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,069
What was all that?

1092
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:26,865
Not all Gorg-speak has humans words.

1093
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:31,582
But, it turns out, Gorg was not here
because of my invitation...

1094
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,042
though Gorg would have been happy
to attend.

1095
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:39,256
Gorg was here
because Gorg was tracking the rock.

1096
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:40,920
What was in that thing?

1097
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,212
Gorg family.

1098
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:45,640
It is entire next generation.

1099
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,267
All of them?

1100
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:49,269
All of them.

1101
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:01,903
No wonder they've been chasing you.

1102
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:05,111
Not "they," "he."

1103
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:09,123
Apparently, that Gorg is last Gorg.

1104
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,283
That is why rock was so important.

1105
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:13,452
Without it, he was alonely...

1106
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:16,042
and would someday be extinctly...

1107
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:19,254
which made Gorg cranky and irrational...

1108
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,635
and physically violent.

1109
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:23,762
He was just like humansgirl.

1110
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:28,809
He was sad-mad.

1111
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:37,981
Thanking you.

1112
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:40,821
Thanking you!
High hand touching.

1113
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:42,652
Yeah, give it here. High hand touching.

1114
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:45,159
Up high! You are too slow.

1115
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,946
High hand touching! That hurt.

1116
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:15,514
Pigcat!

1117
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,183
Hey, Oh!

1118
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,354
Hello, friend Kyle.

1119
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,443
I have that same color.

1120
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,482
- Hi, Mimom.
- Hi, Oh.

1121
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:26,946
Awesome party, Oh!

1122
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:29,953
Parties are so much more fun
when other people show up.

1123
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,285
Is it time to pick it up a level?

1124
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:33,448
Yes!

1125
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:35,993
This is gonna be sweet!

1126
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,162
Drop it like it has a high temperature!

1127
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,390
Oh, no!

1128
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:59,399
What is happening to my body?

1129
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,732
Shake your Boov thang!

1130
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:10,240
My hands are in the air
like I just do not care!

1131
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:19,253
<i>I has a new start in a new home
with new friends.</i>

1132
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:23,541
<i>And now, every day is best day ever!</i>

1133
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:47,364
<i>You are all invited
to a party, party, party.</i>

1134
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:50,072
<i>Just head to the Milky Way.
Turn right at the Big Dipper.</i>

1135
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:51,702
<i>Third planet from the Sun.</i>

1136
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,237
<i>Look for my balloons!</i>

1137
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:54,700
<i>Come party!</i>

1138
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:57,791
Everybody, smile!
