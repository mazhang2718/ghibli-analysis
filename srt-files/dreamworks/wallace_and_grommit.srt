1
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,626
Ah!

2
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:51,258
Ho-ho!
Cracking job, Gromit.

3
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,726
Hang on, old chum.

4
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,429
- What's going on?
- Who is it?

5
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,164
Reel him in, lad.

6
00:04:57,264 --> 00:05:00,634
To me. To me.

7
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,136
Gotcha! Thieving monster.

8
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,912
Ooh! Me prize pumpkin.

9
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:16,384
Me little baby.
Me pride and joy.

10
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:18,251
You've saved it,
Anti-Pesto.

11
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,855
It was nothing
at all, Mrs... Oh!

12
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,524
Ah! Oh, no!

13
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,058
Everything's under control.

14
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,994
- Don't worry, madam.
- Ah!

15
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:32,633
Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

16
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,902
All in a night's work,
Mrs. Mulch.

17
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,070
- Huh?
- Ah!

18
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,939
Cute little feller, isn't he?

19
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,875
You'd never believe
they'd cause so much damage.

20
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,744
Oh, he may
look innocent, sir.

21
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,979
But left to his own devices,

22
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,084
this is the ultimate
vegetable-destroying machine.

23
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,953
- Hee!
- Oh!

24
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,022
Reg, me teeth!

25
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:59,527
Job well done, lad.

26
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:04,498
Subject disarmed
and neutralized.

27
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,801
Bless you, Anti-Pesto.

28
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:11,539
With you out there
protecting our veg,

29
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,742
the most important event
of the year is safe.

30
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:19,547
Aye. And I hope they
give them pests what's
coming to 'em, and all.

31
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,816
Amen to that, Mrs. Mulch.

32
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,593
Whee!

33
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,968
Whee!

34
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,196
Oh! Whee!

35
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,837
It was a long, hard night
last night, Gromit.

36
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:54,508
I'll need a good, hearty
breakfast under me belt.

37
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,744
Pile it up, lad.

38
00:07:56,844 --> 00:08:00,614
I'm in the mood for food!

39
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:05,052
Oh, uh...
Gromit, old pal.

40
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:09,156
It's happened again.
I'll need assistance.

41
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,098
Ow! Oof!

42
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,308
Ah. Oh!

43
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,677
Well, thanks, chuck.

44
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:33,280
I'm sure that
hole's getting smaller.

45
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:38,251
Ah! Another successful night.

46
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,387
How are the inmates?

47
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:43,423
Must be getting
a bit full down there.

48
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,428
Talking of which.

49
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,899
Now, for a great big plate of...

50
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,169
vegetables.

51
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,671
A-ha!

52
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:00,540
Still got me on
the diet, eh, Gromit?

53
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:04,578
Watching me shape?
There's a good dog.

54
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:08,081
Oh, oh! Uh...
Gromit, lad?

55
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,619
How's that prize melon
of yours coming on?

56
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:15,122
Must be a while
since you measured it.

57
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:46,887
Mmm! Lovely food.
For rabbits, that is.

58
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,631
As for me, I need
something a bit more cheesy.

59
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,169
A-ha!

60
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,276
Ooh!

61
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,147
Oh!

62
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:16,850
Oh! Oh.

63
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,888
Caught red-handed, eh, lad?

64
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,925
I'm sorry, Gromit.

65
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,796
I know you're doing this
for my own good,

66
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:33,734
but the fact is
I'm just crackers about cheese.

67
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,569
Look, if I must change me ways,

68
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,039
at least let me do it my way.

69
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,709
With technology.

70
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:48,015
It's time we tried
my latest invention,

71
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:52,485
the Mind Manipulation-omatic.

72
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,721
Ha!

73
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:56,123
It extracts unwanted thoughts

74
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,424
and desires.

75
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:01,461
I haven't tested it yet,
but it should be perfectly safe.

76
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:05,866
Just a bit of harmless
brain alteration, that's all.

77
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,440
Uh-oh!

78
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,877
Anti-Pesto Humane Pest Control.

79
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,812
How might we be of assistance?

80
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:22,349
Ah, yes. Lady Tottington
here of Tottington Hall.

81
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:23,717
Your Ladyship.

82
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,186
This is an honor.
Oh! Ow!

83
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,589
It's a disaster. I have the
most terrible rabbit problem.

84
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,526
The competition's only
days away. You simply
have to do something.

85
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,798
Certainly, ma'am.
I think we're about
to go up in the world, lad.

86
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,600
Just stay right where
you are, your Ladyship,

87
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,504
and we'll be with you
in an... Ahh!

88
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,974
In an hour?
I can't wait an hour.

89
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,309
I have a major infestation.

90
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,678
Hmm? Hello? Hello?

91
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,546
Hmm.

92
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,149
Ah! That's more like it.

93
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,820
Thank goodness you've... Oh!

94
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,892
What ho! For you, my love.

95
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,026
Victor.

96
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:09,096
How lovely and...
unexpected.

97
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:12,432
Heard you had a spot of rabbit
bother and toodled on over

98
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,901
to sort the blighters out.

99
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:16,669
Gosh, that's... that's
awfully sweet of you.

100
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,205
But you really needn't bother.

101
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,007
It's no bother,
little boo-boo.

102
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,209
It's the least a chap
can do for his filly.

103
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:26,346
Don't want pests spoiling our
beautiful manor house, do we?

104
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,781
"Our" manor house?

105
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:31,651
No one's mentioned
marriage, Victor.

106
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,720
All in
good time, my dear.

107
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,923
Vermin first, though, what what.

108
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,557
Come on, Phillip.

109
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:42,963
Victor! We can deal
with this humanely.

110
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,867
Ho-ho!
Very classy.

111
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:51,471
Just the sort of client we
should be dealing with, eh, lad?

112
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,350
Oh!

113
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,653
Burrowing bounders!

114
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:10,057
They must be breeding like...

115
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,359
well, rabbits.

116
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:16,296
Only one thing for it, lad.

117
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,770
- Victor, hadn't we agreed?
- Hmm.

118
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:26,039
No more thoughtless killing.

119
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,440
Quite right, my dear.

120
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,210
So I've thought this one
through very carefully.

121
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,645
It's off to bunny heaven
for you, big ears.

122
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,481
Victor! No!

123
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,351
- Ah!
- What the...?

124
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:55,502
Champion
sucker, eh, Gromit?

125
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:59,239
The BunVac 6000.

126
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,509
Whee!

127
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:05,145
This'll impress her Ladyship.

128
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,148
I don't understand. It
should have been a bull's-eye.

129
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,550
Oh, Victor. I felt we'd
made a real breakthrough

130
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,787
with this hunting obsession
of yours. I really thought
you'd changed.

131
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:19,326
I'm sorry, Campanula,
but I am what I am.

132
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,095
There's no nonsense
with Victor Quartermaine.

133
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,065
What you see is what you get.

134
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,100
What the...?

135
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,540
Sounds like a really

136
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,708
big brute, this one.

137
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,410
Give it some more welly.

138
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:43,050
Gosh!

139
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:56,263
Maybe I should've
used a bigger nozzle.

140
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,664
Ah!

141
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:01,634
Anti-Pesto, you're here.

142
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,470
Oh!

143
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,573
Your Ladyship.

144
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:09,576
My darlings!

145
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,981
You're safe.

146
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,815
- Oh!
- My word!

147
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:20,020
What a fabulous job you've done.
And not a single one harmed.

148
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,123
Ah! The old
BV6000, ma'am.

149
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:27,560
Capable of 125 RPM.
That's rabbits per minute.

150
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,197
How inspired!

151
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,831
- Mr...?
- Oh, Wallace.

152
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,700
- Mr. Wallace.
- Mmm.

153
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,935
Is this all of them?

154
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:40,240
Oh, uh, just one left.
Hoist her up, Gromit.

155
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,613
Ah!

156
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:53,686
Victor, stop
fooling around in the dirt
and have a look at this.

157
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,922
The ingenious Anti-Pesto

158
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:58,725
have completely dealt
with my rabbit problem.

159
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,328
- Isn't it marvelous?
- Marvelous?

160
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,595
Marvelous?

161
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:06,466
This confounded contraption
virtually suffocated me!

162
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:11,104
Besides, the job's
only half done.

163
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,706
How do you intend
to finish these vermin off?

164
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,542
Crush 'em?
Liquidize 'em?

165
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:19,579
- They're humane.
- Humane?

166
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,984
Well, then perhaps
they'd be humane enough
to give me back my dignity.

167
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,120
I want...

168
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:32,225
Toupee, please.

169
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,495
Oh, grand.
Uh, we take check or cash.

170
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:39,699
Toupee, you idiot!
My hair is in your machine.

171
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,436
Oh, no, it's only
rabbits in there.

172
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:47,006
- The hare, I think you'll find,
is a much larger mammal.

173
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,309
Out of my way, fool.

174
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:57,184
I'm sorry, my dear,
but I refuse to suffer
any further humiliation

175
00:16:57,284 --> 00:17:00,053
at the hands
of these blundering nitwits.

176
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:03,323
I therefore bid you good day.

177
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:12,265
Thank you for ridding me of a real problem, Mr.
 Wallace.

178
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:16,403
Tell me, what exactly will
you do with all these rabbits?

179
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:17,870
Oh, um...

180
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,339
Trade secret.

181
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,974
Yes. I'd be happy
to let them roam free

182
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:23,743
if it wasn't
for the competition.

183
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,745
But they do so love their veg.

184
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,349
It's in their little
bunny natures, and you
can't change that, can you?

185
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,684
No.

186
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,057
Or can you?

187
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:44,364
Why didn't we
think of it before, lad?

188
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:49,136
The solution to all
our storage problems.

189
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:52,639
Simply by connecting the BunVac

190
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,908
to the Mind
Manipulation-omatic,

191
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,679
we can brainwash the bunnies.

192
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:03,150
Rabbit rehabilitation.

193
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:08,921
Once cured of their antisocial
veg-ravaging behavior,

194
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,891
the rabbits can
be safely released

195
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,494
without fear
of re-offending.

196
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,996
Just a little added lunar power

197
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,766
to enhance the mind waves...

198
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,375
and we can begin.

199
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,647
Veg, bad.

200
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,617
Veg, bad.

201
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,553
Veg, bad.

202
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,991
Say no to carrots,

203
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,861
cabbage and cauliflower.

204
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,800
Well, come on, lad,
what are you waiting for?

205
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,668
Turn on the BunVac.

206
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,637
Full suction.

207
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,713
Ah!

208
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:15,054
It's working, Gromit.
Oh! It's working!

209
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,424
Ho-ho!

210
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,428
Their tiny bunny brains

211
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:26,233
are being saturated
in my veg-free mind waves.

212
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,601
Ha!

213
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,371
Another 30 minutes
brainwashing should suffice.

214
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,374
Then we can move on
to the conditioning.

215
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,581
- Ooh!
- Ah!

216
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:46,953
Ah!

217
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,188
Ooh! Gromit!

218
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:52,425
Switch it off!

219
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,160
- Whee!
- Get it off!

220
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,964
Get it off me, lad!

221
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:14,281
Oh, thanks, lad.

222
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,453
Ah!

223
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,154
Quick.

224
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,890
Give us a carrot.

225
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,802
Ah! It worked, Gromit!

226
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,170
A reformed rabbit.

227
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,941
We'll call him Hutch.
Shall we?

228
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,110
Come on.
Let's get the kettle on.

229
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,113
We'll see to him in the morning.

230
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:51,618
Ho-ho! I feel
we're on the cusp

231
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:55,422
of a real breakthrough, lad.

232
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:03,029
Mankind freed from
rabbit problems forever.

233
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,936
Lady Tottington
will be impressed.

234
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,722
Good night.

235
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,191
Sleep tight.

236
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,761
And don't let the bed bugs bite.

237
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:25,177
Good night, Gromit.

238
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,481
Sweet dreams, old chum.

239
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:58,077
Protect and nourish
the frail and the weak, O Lord.

240
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:03,182
Let them grow big and strong
under Thy loving care.

241
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:07,620
In fact, let them grow bigger
and stronger than anyone else's,

242
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,257
so that the
first prize might be mine.

243
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,893
Amen.

244
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:17,930
The harvest offering
to bind the deal.

245
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,569
* We plow the fields and
scatter the good seed on... *

246
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:25,071
Huh?

247
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:32,512
Mmm. Ahem.

248
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:50,162
* He sends
the snow in winter... *

249
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:59,639
* All good gifts around us

250
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,173
* Are sent from...

251
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:05,978
Heavens above.

252
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,580
Hello?

253
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,153
Hello? Is anybody there?

254
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,792
Mrs. Mulch?

255
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:23,530
Please, come forward,
whoever you are.

256
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,832
There's no need to be afraid.

257
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,937
Ah! You're hungry.

258
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:34,373
Then please, take what you like.

259
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,077
It is for the needy,
after all.

260
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:46,085
No! No! No! No!

261
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,488
Mercy!

262
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,325
Ah!

263
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:52,719
Ow!

264
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,688
Morning, Gromit.

265
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:03,696
A pest-free night
per... chance?

266
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:08,701
Oh!

267
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:11,671
Lummy day.

268
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,107
- It's a disaster.
- Me garden's ruined.

269
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:18,277
- It's carnage out there.
- Where were Anti-Pesto?

270
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:20,880
Simmer down, now.

271
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,184
Right. One at a time,
if ya please.

272
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:28,187
We pay good money
for our crop protection.

273
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:32,659
If ya can't deliver
the goods, maybe you
should keep your traps shut.

274
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:36,595
I never saw such
cauliflower carnage.

275
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:39,832
Worse than the
Great Slug Blight of '32,

276
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:43,602
when there were slugs
the size of pigs.

277
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,905
Growbag's right.
The slugs are back!

278
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:47,373
The slugs are back!

279
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,108
That's enough!
That's enough!

280
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:54,180
Look, this flippin'
vegetable competition

281
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,149
- causes nothin'
but trouble every year.
- Here we go.

282
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,051
- If ya ask me...
- Get on with ya!

283
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:03,990
Know what? I'll tell ya.
If ya ask me, this was arson.

284
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,792
- Arson?
- Aye!

285
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:08,527
Someone arsin' around.

286
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,831
That's right.
One of you lot. A man.

287
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:14,667
- This was no man.
- What are you saying?

288
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:21,407
Does a man have teeth

289
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,743
the size of axe blades?

290
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:31,751
Or ears
like terrible tombstones?

291
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,455
By tampering with nature,

292
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:41,160
forcing vegetables to swell
far beyond their natural size,

293
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:46,432
we have brought a terrible
judgment upon ourselves.

294
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,770
Hey! Give over!

295
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,441
You're mental.

296
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,642
And for our sins,

297
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:58,544
a hideous creature

298
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,646
has been sent to punish us all!

299
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:02,749
Repent! Repent!

300
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:06,385
Lest you, too,
taste the wrath of...

301
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,257
the Were-Rabbit!

302
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,692
This is terrible!

303
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,795
What's going to happen to us?

304
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:18,130
- Doomed!
- Who's going to help us?

305
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,167
- What's to become of the show?
- We live for that competition.

306
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:24,070
- Get off me.
- We're simple folk.
It's all we have.

307
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,772
- Who will save us?
- Get... Hey!

308
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,509
A Were-Rabbit?

309
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:31,944
Oh, come, come, now.

310
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,579
I do believe the Vicar's been

311
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,714
to the communion wine again.

312
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:41,988
What we are dealing with here
is no supernatural rabbit.

313
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:45,324
It's a big fellow, perhaps.

314
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,544
- But a mortal creature
of flesh and blood.

315
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:51,864
- A matter easily dealt with
by a hunter.

316
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:56,068
Guns will not be necessary,
thank you, Victor.

317
00:28:56,168 --> 00:29:00,039
Hasn't there been
enough destruction?

318
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:04,476
I believe the killing
of fluffy creatures

319
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,678
is never justified.

320
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:10,817
I say we give Anti-Pesto
a second chance.

321
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:14,987
What? How on earth would
those tiny-minded buffoons

322
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,357
ever catch such a big rabbit?

323
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:21,093
Mr. Wallace?

324
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,196
Oh! Oh...

325
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:26,498
Um...

326
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,301
Well...

327
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,374
With a big trap.

328
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:38,110
By Jove. He's...
He's got it!

329
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,812
- Genius!
- Genius!

330
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:42,081
- Brilliant.
- What a great idea!

331
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:44,851
Hmm. Clever.

332
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,119
You see, Victor,

333
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:50,990
there's hope
for the vegetables yet.

334
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,493
Not the ones I'm looking at.

335
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:58,230
That's me boys!

336
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,641
Ah! Love, Gromit.

337
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:12,711
That's the biggest trap of all.

338
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,646
The "tender trap," they call it.

339
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,850
And that's what we'll use
to catch this thing.

340
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:22,554
Yes, lad, a lovely lady rabbit.

341
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:29,996
How could any
hot-blooded rabbit-beast resist?

342
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:33,399
Ah!

343
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,173
Oh, come on, Gromit.

344
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:46,145
A bit more,
you know, alluring.

345
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:52,518
Ho-ho!

346
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:55,021
Very cheeky.

347
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:02,895
Ha-ha!

348
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:05,131
That's more like it, lad.

349
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:08,834
How can we possibly fail now?

350
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:11,570
You're a total knockout.

351
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,942
Oops!

352
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:21,914
Stick around, lad.

353
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,918
Should fix back on quite easily.

354
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:27,299
Nighty-night, me lovelies.

355
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:30,636
Think big now.

356
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,714
Ah!

357
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,254
No!

358
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:39,004
Don't worry. No. No.

359
00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:41,640
Well, I'm very sorry,
Mrs. Mulch.

360
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,110
We'll get there as soon
as we can. Mr. Dibber. Oh, yes.

361
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:47,613
Uh, can I call you back?
Mrs. Girdling.

362
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:50,549
- A tunnel you say? Oh!
- What do you intend
to do about this?

363
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,551
I'll look into it.

364
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,254
So where did you get to, lad?

365
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:57,456
I thought I told
you to stay put.

366
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:59,391
It's gone mad around here.

367
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:03,562
I thought we were
supposed to be a team.

368
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,631
How are we ever
gonna catch this thing

369
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:08,934
if you go gallivanting off
on your own all the time?

370
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:12,338
You're doing it again!

371
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:15,407
Where are you going now?

372
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:16,708
Gromit!

373
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,346
Grommy!

374
00:36:22,248 --> 00:36:24,616
Really, lad.
You do realize

375
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:27,686
I've made a personal promise
to Lady Tottington.

376
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:30,322
How is this sort of
behavior going to get us

377
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:34,059
any nearer to finding
a rabbit-mon... ster?

378
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,201
Hutch.

379
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,472
Oh, Gromit.

380
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:49,408
We've created a monster.

381
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:52,711
Hutch is the beast.

382
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:56,515
The lunar panels.

383
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,985
They must've over-stimulated

384
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:02,754
Hutch's primitive bunny nature.

385
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,257
And now, when the moon appears,

386
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:10,296
he undergoes
a hideous transformation.

387
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:15,267
Oh!

388
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,913
Oh, Gromit.

389
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:33,519
This is absolutely...

390
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,222
fantastic!

391
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:38,790
Don't you see, lad?

392
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,594
OK, so we've created
a veg-ravaging rabbit-monster.

393
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:46,231
But we've also captured it.

394
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:48,567
Just like I promised
Lady Tottington.

395
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:52,103
I'll go and tell
her the good news.

396
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,906
Make sure he doesn't escape.

397
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,675
Bye!

398
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,138
Mr. Wallace.

399
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:35,106
It's the beast, your Ladyship.

400
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,308
I bring great news.

401
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:41,547
Gosh, how exciting.
Please, do come in.

402
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:56,094
Well, this
is simply spiffing news.

403
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:59,865
With the beast in captivity,
the competition can
go ahead as planned.

404
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:03,201
- You saved the day,
Mr. Wallace.
- Oh...

405
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:05,303
It was nothing, your Ladyship.

406
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,305
So modest.

407
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,307
Oh, please, do help yourself.

408
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,109
Oh!

409
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,978
Thanks.

410
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:16,615
I so appreciate you
coming all this way

411
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:18,349
to let me know, Wallace.

412
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,186
Tell me, are you
a vegetable-lover yourself?

413
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:24,756
- They're... growing on me.
- Then come with me.

414
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:29,661
There's something very
special I want to show you.

415
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:32,464
Oh!

416
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:38,970
Hop in.

417
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:43,775
- It's very snug.
- It's my Jacob's ladder.

418
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,013
And it goes
all the way to heaven.

419
00:40:57,022 --> 00:41:01,159
Welcome to my
inner sanctum, Wallace.

420
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:05,063
My secret garden. Oh!

421
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:07,999
It's a veritable

422
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:11,537
vegetable paradise.

423
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:14,139
I just knew you'd love it.

424
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,674
Unlike Victor.

425
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:19,110
He's never shown
any interest in my produce.

426
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,314
- His loss, Lady Tottington.
- Please, Wallace.

427
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,250
Call me Totty.

428
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:39,130
If anything
were to happen to my vegetables,

429
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,866
I don't know what I'd do.

430
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:42,868
I'm sure you understand,
Mr. Wallace.

431
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:45,604
I can see that you're
a true nature lover.

432
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:47,773
Oh, yes. Yes, I am.

433
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:50,809
At first,
I thought I could change Victor.

434
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:54,680
- Now I'm not so sure.
- Oh!

435
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,248
Do you think a man
can change, Wallace?

436
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,984
Change?

437
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:00,686
Oh, yes.

438
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:10,762
Really, Phillip. The things
one does for love.

439
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:19,304
Pesto.

440
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,242
- Mr. Wallace.
- Oh, Totty.

441
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:26,645
Totty?

442
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:33,151
I'd like
to show you one last thing.

443
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:38,056
Something no other man
has ever seen.

444
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:39,524
Oh!

445
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:42,193
My carrot de Chantenay.

446
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:44,796
Just smell it, Wallace.

447
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,698
- Feel its silken flesh.
- Oh, yes.

448
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:51,069
Isn't it the most
sumptuous, succulent
specimen you've ever seen?

449
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,404
- Yes!
- Doesn't it fill your heart

450
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:54,906
- with desire?
- Yes!

451
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:58,744
Just imagine
what it would taste like.

452
00:43:03,148 --> 00:43:05,884
What on earth
were you thinkin' of, lad?

453
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:10,388
Ruined a perfectly
good piece of fashionable
knitwear, that did.

454
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:14,993
To say nothing of
a relationship with
an important client.

455
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:19,998
It's lucky for us her Ladyship
was so understanding.

456
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:24,803
Honestly, I don't know
what's got into you lately.

457
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,972
And slow down for pity's sake.

458
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:30,375
You'll buckle me trunnions.

459
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,616
Don't worry.
I'll see to this.

460
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:42,688
You stay here where you belong.
In the doghouse.

461
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:48,760
Right.

462
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:54,666
It's heavier than it looks.

463
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:03,875
Oh!

464
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,044
- I know your
little secret, Pesto.
- Oh!

465
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:09,047
- I know exactly
what's going on.
- Your Lordship...

466
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,817
Oh, yes. You think you can
pilfer my filly, don't you?

467
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:14,385
You think you can con a woman

468
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,722
- out of her fortune?
- Who, me?

469
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:17,989
Well, I got here first!

470
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:19,925
I've spent
a long time reeling in

471
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:21,659
that fluffy-headed
bunny-lover.

472
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,829
And I'm not about
to let some puddle-headed

473
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:25,096
peasant poach her from me.

474
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:28,433
- Comprenez?
- Oh, uh, right-o.

475
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:30,869
I'll be off then. Ta-ta.

476
00:44:31,937 --> 00:44:35,006
You're not going
anywhere, Pesto.

477
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:37,441
Ow!

478
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:39,210
Not until I've taught you

479
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,312
a jolly good lesson.

480
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:45,984
Come on!
Queensberry rules!

481
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:47,819
Put 'em up, ya little pipsqueak.

482
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:52,523
You're shaking.

483
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:56,627
Don't tell me you're
a scaredy-cat as well
as a scoundrel.

484
00:45:00,966 --> 00:45:04,202
And don't think acting
like a big girl's blouse

485
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:05,470
will get you out of it.

486
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:08,273
There's no mercy
with Victor Quartermaine.

487
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,375
- Oh!
- Huh?

488
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:11,910
Huh?

489
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:15,346
Ohhh!

490
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:28,359
What the dickens?

491
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:35,200
What on earth...?

492
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:43,108
Ooh!

493
00:45:56,521 --> 00:45:59,190
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

494
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:13,038
Ahh!

495
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,843
Phillip! Attack!

496
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:19,811
Attack!

497
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:23,815
What the...?

498
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:10,328
Ahh!

499
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:19,203
Vicar!

500
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,805
Vicar!

501
00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:22,640
Oh, where the devil is he?

502
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:23,975
Do you want to confess?

503
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:26,811
I want to talk to you about...

504
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:28,213
the beast.

505
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:35,086
Everything you need
to know is in this book.

506
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:41,592
- "Nun Wrestling."
- No, no, no! I meant this one.

507
00:47:53,438 --> 00:47:55,640
Ew!

508
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,008
Ah!

509
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:59,144
Here. Here it is.

510
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:03,949
The hideous monster
plaguing our parish.

511
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:06,918
The Were-Rabbit.

512
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,555
So it's true.

513
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:14,192
The beast lurks
within all of us, my child.

514
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:19,230
The side that emerges at night
as the moon rises into the sky.

515
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:22,633
The side that
savagely rips the leaves

516
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,103
off any innocent cabbage.

517
00:48:25,203 --> 00:48:26,771
Spare me the sermon, Vicar.

518
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:30,775
Just tell me how
I kill him. Um, I mean "it."

519
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,910
To kill such a creature

520
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:35,780
would require nerves of steel

521
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,116
and...

522
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,651
a bullet.

523
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,121
A bullet?

524
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:45,590
A bullet.

525
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,226
A bull... Oh!

526
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:50,528
What kind of bullet?

527
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:55,566
A bullet of pure gold.

528
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:01,672
Gold.

529
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,041
Yes.

530
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:07,112
Twenty-four karat.

531
00:49:08,213 --> 00:49:10,148
Oh! Get out of my way.

532
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:12,250
Silly old fool.

533
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:16,487
Beware!
Beware of the beast within!

534
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,208
Hee-hee!

535
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:11,876
Ah! Ah.

536
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:14,279
Perfect re-entry, Gromit.

537
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:17,715
This veg diet's
doing the trick, eh, lad?

538
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:19,984
I feel smashing.

539
00:50:20,085 --> 00:50:21,486
Mmm.

540
00:50:21,586 --> 00:50:27,192
So how's our rabbit-monster?
Hmm?

541
00:50:27,292 --> 00:50:30,061
Hope you're
keeping an eye on him.

542
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:42,640
Uh... What's up, dog?

543
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,045
Yow!

544
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:51,149
Well, fancy that.

545
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:53,551
Rabbit ears.

546
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:56,053
That is a bit odd.

547
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,759
And what
are you tryin' to say, lad?

548
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:08,099
What? What?

549
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:12,103
What? You think
that I'm the...?

550
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:14,905
Because of these?

551
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:16,174
Oh, no.

552
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:18,676
No. This is just a reaction

553
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:22,079
to that healthy veg diet
you've got me on.

554
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,849
It's the toxins coming out.

555
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:27,084
Silly old pooch.

556
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:29,854
Thinking I'm the beast.

557
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,057
Next thing you'll be saying

558
00:51:33,158 --> 00:51:36,194
is that, oh, Hutch
is turning into me.

559
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:43,368
Hey.
What are you doing, lad?

560
00:51:43,468 --> 00:51:46,304
Have you gone completely mad?

561
00:51:51,476 --> 00:51:54,845
- Cheese!
- Ah!

562
00:51:56,247 --> 00:52:00,151
Cheese? Ah!

563
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:12,263
Huh?

564
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:34,352
Oh, I do like
a bit of Gorgonzola.

565
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:40,758
Oh, dear.

566
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:45,363
- Perfect.
- Ma'am.

567
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:47,465
- Now, let's see.
- Coming through!

568
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:49,200
Mind your back.

569
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,001
The tombola's arrived.

570
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:54,205
And the bouncy Tottington Hall.

571
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:56,874
Splendid.

572
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:02,913
Oh, it's going to be such
a jolly competition tonight.

573
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,349
I just know it.

574
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:06,551
- Ya don't know nothin'.
- What?

575
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:10,355
The beast has struck again.
That's what.

576
00:53:10,455 --> 00:53:12,657
That's right!

577
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:14,692
No, no, you're quite
mistaken, Mrs. Mulch.

578
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:17,228
- The beast is in captivity.
- Oh, yeah?

579
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:20,698
Then just take a look
at my wife's brassicas.

580
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:24,134
- Ravaged in the night.
- But I don't understand.

581
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:26,637
- Anti-Pesto told me...
- A pack of lies!

582
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:29,874
It's not safe to bring
our vegetables here.

583
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:31,976
The show's off.

584
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:37,715
But this is
simply dreadful news.

585
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:39,984
The Tottingtons have held

586
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:42,152
a giant vegetable competition

587
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:46,123
on this very night
for over 500 years.

588
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,858
That's right.

589
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:53,163
Not even the Great Duck Plague
of '53 stopped it.

590
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:57,902
Oh! If only there
were another way.

591
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:01,839
What ho!

592
00:54:01,939 --> 00:54:03,574
It's Quartermaine.

593
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:06,243
Heard you had
a spot of rabbit bother.

594
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:18,423
Didn't
this bit used to...?

595
00:54:18,523 --> 00:54:20,558
Now. Now, let's see.

596
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:22,893
Oh. Ow!

597
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:26,531
Oh, where does this part go?

598
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:31,436
Oh!

599
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:38,809
Oh, it's hopeless.

600
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:42,012
- I'll never fix
this flippin' machine.
- Oh!

601
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,483
Me mind's just
a rabbit-y mush.

602
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:47,385
Oh, Gromit.

603
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:51,956
I don't wanna be a giant rabbit!

604
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:56,594
Aw!

605
00:54:56,694 --> 00:55:00,264
The bounce is gone
from his bungee.

606
00:55:12,377 --> 00:55:17,615
Hey, presto!
Rabbit rehabilitation.

607
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:21,085
But if I can't fix it...

608
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:22,652
Cheddar.

609
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,590
Maybe the other me can!

610
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,592
I'm inventing, mostly.

611
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:31,061
Look at me go!
Ho-ho! I'm a genius.

612
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,963
Ah!

613
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:37,568
Awake! I can't answer
the door. Not like this.

614
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:40,170
Charming. I'm Wallace.

615
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,273
Ah! I already am!

616
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:44,742
Hutch!

617
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:49,213
Geronimo!

618
00:55:49,313 --> 00:55:50,815
Huh? Wallace?

619
00:55:50,915 --> 00:55:53,818
Uh, hang on a mo'.

620
00:55:53,918 --> 00:55:55,853
Wallace?

621
00:55:55,953 --> 00:56:00,391
Hello? I say.
Open this door at once.

622
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:03,761
Oh. Totty.

623
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:06,764
Uh, Lady Tottington,
if you don't mind.

624
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:10,435
- Oh.
- I'm afraid I have some
rather bad news, Wallace.

625
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:12,770
Thing is, well,

626
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:17,808
you've rather let
me down with this
beastly beast business.

627
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:19,910
- I suppose I have.
- Yes.

628
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,747
Well, it's obvious
to me that you have
absolutely no idea

629
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:24,649
where this poor creature is.

630
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:27,117
And I'm afraid
you've given me no option

631
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:31,589
but to let Victor
shoot the poor thing.

632
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,724
Shoot it?

633
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,894
Yes. Wasn't an easy choice,

634
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:39,396
but the veg competition
has to come first.

635
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:42,500
Besides, Victor's
promised me it won't suffer.

636
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,102
It will be quick and painless.

637
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:47,004
How thoughtful.

638
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:50,207
I cannot deny it was
a difficult decision for me.

639
00:56:50,307 --> 00:56:53,077
Because I've
recently developed...

640
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:55,379
Hurry! Ah!

641
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,947
Feelings for you.

642
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:58,248
Uh, feelings?

643
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:00,250
Oh, well, never mind, eh?

644
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,787
- Ta-ra, then.
- Wait! Wallace.

645
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:05,790
I haven't finished. There's
more that needs to be said.

646
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,025
Well, I'll give you
a tinkle, shall I?

647
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,728
Can't we at least shake
hands? Part as friends?

648
00:57:10,828 --> 00:57:13,430
It's not very convenient
at the moment.

649
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:15,733
Thanks for coming by.

650
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:18,669
Well, I... I...

651
00:57:23,307 --> 00:57:24,408
Oh!

652
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:35,586
That's right, my lovely.

653
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:40,958
You can say goodbye
to your fluffy lover-boy.

654
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,262
You gotta help me, Gromit!

655
00:57:45,362 --> 00:57:47,331
Hide me. Anything.

656
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:49,399
Before it's too late!

657
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,135
Lad!

658
00:57:51,235 --> 00:57:53,137
Your Lordship.

659
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,815
Ahh!

660
00:58:20,965 --> 00:58:22,633
Ooh!

661
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:26,904
Good night, Gromit.

662
00:59:19,323 --> 00:59:21,926
'Tis done.

663
00:59:25,462 --> 00:59:27,765
My poor sensitive child.

664
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:33,838
Allow us all to share
in your moment of sorrow.

665
00:59:37,608 --> 00:59:39,309
Yeah!

666
00:59:41,045 --> 00:59:44,949
On with the show!

667
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:56,961
Hmm? What the...?

668
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:03,200
Why you...

669
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,682
Of course.

670
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:21,618
The vegetable competition.

671
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:25,189
Your loyalty is moving.

672
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:27,758
Sadly, you won't be.

673
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:29,226
Come along, Phillip.

674
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:32,529
Everyone's been looking
forward to a good show.

675
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,733
Let's see they get one.

676
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,327
Hey!

677
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:07,331
- Hooray!
- Ah, Mr. Growbag.

678
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:12,770
I... I have a hunch
this'll be a night to remember.

679
01:01:13,437 --> 01:01:14,972
I just have a hunch.

680
01:01:15,072 --> 01:01:17,842
All right. All right. If we
must do this flipping veg show,

681
01:01:17,942 --> 01:01:20,878
let's do it in an orderly
and law-abiding fashion.

682
01:01:20,978 --> 01:01:22,880
Cucumbers, give way to marrows.

683
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,548
Carrots, wait your turn!

684
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:27,451
- Aubergines...
- A-ha! There's
our bait, Phillip.

685
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:31,455
All we have to do now is wait
for our fluffy friend to appear.

686
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:37,027
Look over here, everyone!
It's Victor!

687
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:39,296
- He's here!
- Our hero.

688
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:41,198
Please,
sir, kiss my baby.

689
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:43,500
- Another time, perhaps.
- Kiss my potato.

690
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,503
- Not now.
- Kiss my artichoke.

691
01:01:46,603 --> 01:01:48,038
- Look, just...
- Victor.

692
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:49,606
Campanula!

693
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:54,144
Victor, I have to know.
Did it suffer?

694
01:01:54,244 --> 01:01:58,115
Of course not, my dear.
Not yet, anyway.

695
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,084
- Victor?
- Oy, you.

696
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:02,887
- Constable.
- Careful with them capsicums.

697
01:02:02,987 --> 01:02:04,889
Listen, I don't want
to cause panic,

698
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:06,924
but the beast
isn't actually dead yet.

699
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:09,794
- The beast
isn't actually dead yet?
- What?

700
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:13,430
Huh?

701
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,271
Oops.

702
01:02:22,206 --> 01:02:24,441
To the competition stand!

703
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:43,193
Cracking toast, Gromit.

704
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:48,899
I'm just crackers about cheese.

705
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:53,270
Monterey Jack. Mmm.

706
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:08,318
Smashing Wensleydale.

707
01:03:10,888 --> 01:03:12,789
Whoa!

708
01:03:16,026 --> 01:03:17,928
Whee-hee!

709
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,169
Oh!

710
01:03:29,006 --> 01:03:32,042
Job well done, lad.

711
01:03:49,426 --> 01:03:51,862
Quiet!

712
01:03:52,396 --> 01:03:54,364
Quiet!

713
01:03:57,634 --> 01:03:59,469
Now, listen carefully.

714
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:02,239
I've only got two...

715
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,808
I've only got
one gold bullet left.

716
01:04:04,909 --> 01:04:07,111
So leave this to me.

717
01:04:07,211 --> 01:04:10,547
Yes, all right, I admit
the beast is still at large.

718
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:14,451
But the good news
is your prize vegetables
are the perfect bait...

719
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:18,122
- Bait?
- and will draw
the creature like a magnet.

720
01:04:18,222 --> 01:04:19,723
- Keep still.
- My baby.

721
01:04:19,823 --> 01:04:23,593
There, there.
It'll be all... Huh?

722
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,963
- Mrs. Mulch! No!
- Huh?

723
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:28,598
It's not getting my baby!

724
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:34,905
Lovely food.
For rabbits, that is.

725
01:04:38,642 --> 01:04:40,777
- Come back!
- Come back!

726
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:47,017
Ooh! Ahh!

727
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:50,487
Yes. Right on cue.

728
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:54,291
Come back!

729
01:04:57,494 --> 01:04:59,263
Go away!

730
01:04:59,363 --> 01:05:03,000
That's right.
Come to Uncle Victor.

731
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,574
It's coming for us!

732
01:05:17,481 --> 01:05:20,917
Bingo.

733
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:24,054
What the...?

734
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:29,293
Hurrah for Anti-Pesto!

735
01:05:29,393 --> 01:05:33,297
- It's getting away!
- Get off, you stupid...

736
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:34,664
No!

737
01:05:41,005 --> 01:05:43,307
Vicar, I need more gold bullets.

738
01:05:43,407 --> 01:05:46,210
They don't come cheap, you know.

739
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:57,754
Victor? What are you doing?

740
01:05:57,854 --> 01:05:59,923
I need it, my sweet.
Emergency.

741
01:06:00,024 --> 01:06:02,392
Victor, no! Please!

742
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:04,328
Come, now,
Campanula, let go.

743
01:06:04,428 --> 01:06:06,396
It's my
Golden Carrot Award.

744
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:08,632
This is hardly the time,
my darling.

745
01:06:08,732 --> 01:06:09,892
- Give it to me!
- But Victor!

746
01:06:13,003 --> 01:06:15,072
Cheese, Gromit.

747
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:22,546
The Golden Carrot
belongs in the show!

748
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:25,982
No, the Golden Carrot
belongs in the Were-Rabbit.

749
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:27,651
Huh?

750
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:29,986
Every man for himself!

751
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:33,690
- Help! Help! Help me!
- Ahh!

752
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:38,495
Put me down at once,
you great big hairy thing, you!

753
01:06:38,595 --> 01:06:40,464
Stop! Stop!

754
01:06:40,564 --> 01:06:41,865
Mob supplies!

755
01:06:41,965 --> 01:06:44,468
Get your
angry mob supplies here.

756
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:58,948
Put her down,
you great ugly brute!

757
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,023
I'll bagsy
the lucky rabbit's foot.

758
01:07:09,993 --> 01:07:13,197
Help me, someone! Help me!

759
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,135
Yes.

760
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:27,711
Huh?

761
01:07:30,614 --> 01:07:33,417
No. No, no, no!

762
01:07:33,517 --> 01:07:35,219
No!

763
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:39,656
Huh?

764
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:51,268
- Grrr.
- Ah!

765
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:54,804
Put me down!
Put me down, you...

766
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,174
Whatever you are! Help!

767
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:01,378
What is it?

768
01:08:01,478 --> 01:08:05,715
What are you staring at
with those beastly eyes?

769
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,252
Huh?

770
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,825
Wallace.

771
01:08:39,716 --> 01:08:41,251
Oh, Wallace.

772
01:08:41,351 --> 01:08:44,154
What ever have
you done to yourself?

773
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:48,258
Well, don't you worry.
I'll protect you.

774
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:51,395
Get your hairy mitts

775
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:55,499
off my future wife,
you big brute.

776
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:58,067
No! Victor!

777
01:08:58,168 --> 01:09:00,437
You don't understand.
The hunt is off.

778
01:09:00,537 --> 01:09:02,839
It's... We made
a terrible mistake.

779
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:05,242
Oh, no. You commissioned
me to rid you of Pesto,

780
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:08,044
and that's just
what I intend to do. Oop!

781
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:11,515
- Huh?
- Pesto?

782
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:18,121
Why, you... you knew
it was Wallace all along.

783
01:09:18,222 --> 01:09:20,657
Oh, all right.

784
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:22,592
So what if it is
that blithering idiot.

785
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:25,395
No one will ever believe you.

786
01:09:27,931 --> 01:09:30,300
And if I can't have your money,

787
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,503
I can still bag your bunny.

788
01:09:38,342 --> 01:09:40,744
Oh! My eyes!

789
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:42,246
Run, rabbit, run!

790
01:09:50,086 --> 01:09:52,522
Hmm. I rather like
your hair pinned back.

791
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:54,824
No, Victor, no! Stop! Please!

792
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,460
- Victor!
- Ha!

793
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,365
You can hop,
but you can't hide, Pesto.

794
01:10:14,411 --> 01:10:17,447
Beware the moon!

795
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,896
Stupid interfering mutt.

796
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,469
Ha!

797
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:44,374
Huh?

798
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,233
Stand back!

799
01:11:10,334 --> 01:11:12,702
There may be
a large rabbit dropping!

800
01:11:28,852 --> 01:11:33,523
Looks like the buck stops here.

801
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:03,387
Ah!

802
01:12:31,615 --> 01:12:35,351
Eat karat, bunny boy!

803
01:13:03,513 --> 01:13:05,148
Potty poo!

804
01:13:14,424 --> 01:13:15,925
Huh?

805
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:40,049
No one beats
Victor Quartermaine!

806
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:42,552
Is that so?

807
01:13:42,652 --> 01:13:45,989
Consider yourself dumped.
Humph!

808
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:54,831
He's in there!

809
01:13:56,966 --> 01:14:00,604
- There he is!
- Surround him!

810
01:14:00,704 --> 01:14:03,507
There he is! Over there!

811
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:07,944
Phillip, help me! Phillip!

812
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:09,879
Do something.

813
01:14:10,514 --> 01:14:11,515
Ah!

814
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:12,849
Destroy!

815
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:17,220
Drive out the monstrosity!

816
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:26,496
Well, let's see how he likes it.

817
01:14:28,097 --> 01:14:29,533
Wallace?

818
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:09,839
Oh, Gromit.

819
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:13,276
Well, at least
now he's at peace.

820
01:15:13,376 --> 01:15:15,144
The rabbit's gone.

821
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:17,380
If only there were a way

822
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,884
to bring back Wallace.

823
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:35,064
Lovely cheese,
Gromit.

824
01:15:38,434 --> 01:15:39,769
Gromit?

825
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,939
Don't forget the crackers.

826
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:51,781
Cheese?

827
01:15:53,783 --> 01:15:58,187
Oh! Cheese!

828
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:01,324
It's me again. I'm back!

829
01:16:01,424 --> 01:16:04,427
Gromit!
You clever mutt.

830
01:16:04,527 --> 01:16:07,831
Well done, old pal!

831
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:16,272
- Totty!
- Wallace! You're...

832
01:16:16,372 --> 01:16:18,341
Oh, whoops!

833
01:16:18,441 --> 01:16:20,677
Thanks, lad.

834
01:16:21,745 --> 01:16:23,913
Oh, look!

835
01:16:25,849 --> 01:16:29,619
Well, I think
you deserve this, Gromit.

836
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:34,123
For a brave and splendid marrow.

837
01:16:34,223 --> 01:16:37,426
We've all got a lot
to thank you for.

838
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,629
Ah!

839
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:42,231
Every dog has his day.

840
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:43,867
And thank you, Wallace.

841
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:48,672
You've saved me
from a terrible marriage.

842
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:49,973
All the same,

843
01:16:50,073 --> 01:16:52,475
it is going to be rather lonely

844
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:54,678
at Tottington Hall now.

845
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:59,048
Unless...

846
01:17:00,049 --> 01:17:03,920
I have a little proposal
for you, Wallace.

847
01:17:07,824 --> 01:17:10,259
I'm so thrilled you agreed

848
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:11,761
to go through with this.

849
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:15,398
My pleasure, Totty.

850
01:17:15,498 --> 01:17:18,201
One for the album, Gromit.

851
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:28,644
I declare this bunny
sanctuary officially open.

852
01:17:32,548 --> 01:17:33,850
When you're ready, lad.

853
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:37,954
Fire up the old BV6000.

854
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:49,132
Oh, it's simply marvelous.

855
01:17:49,232 --> 01:17:55,271
My home, a safe haven
for all things fluffy.

856
01:18:01,244 --> 01:18:03,780
I do hope you'll still
come visit, Wallace.

857
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,150
I'd rather got used
to having you around.

858
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:10,453
Oh! There'll
always be a part of me

859
01:18:10,553 --> 01:18:13,790
here at Tottington Hall.

860
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:17,260
Give it some more welly, lad.

861
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:29,138
Cheese!

862
01:24:13,949 --> 01:24:16,685
Ah!
