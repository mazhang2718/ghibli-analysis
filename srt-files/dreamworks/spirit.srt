1
00:00:36,883 --> 00:00:46,554
''Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron''

2
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:47,615
The story I want to tell you,
can not be found in a book.

3
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:51,886
They say the history of the West was
written from the saddle of a horse.

4
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:54,853
But it's never been told
from the heart of one.

5
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:57,327
Not until now.

6
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:00,993
I was born here.

7
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:04,103
In this place that would come
to be called the ''Old West''

8
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:09,368
But to my kind, the land was ageless.
It had no beginning and no end.

9
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:12,637
No boundary between earth and sky.

10
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:17,711
Like the wind in the Buffalo grass.
We belong here.

11
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,242
We will always belong here.

12
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:26,089
They say the mustang is the
spirit of the West.

13
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,059
Whether that West
was won or lost in the end

14
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:30,953
You have to decide for yourself.

15
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:34,628
But the story
I want to tell you is true.

16
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:36,730
I was there.

17
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:38,994
And I remember.

18
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,105
I remember the sun, and the sky
and the wind calling my name.

19
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:46,109
In the time when the wild
horses ran free.

20
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:33,325
And so I grew from colt to stallion

21
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,627
As wild and reckless

22
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,362
As thunder over the land.

23
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,194
Racing with the eagle.

24
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:39,670
Soaring with the wind.

25
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:43,140
Flying? 
There were times I believed I could.

26
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,269
Like my father before me

27
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:20,278
I became leader of the Cimarron herd.
And with that honour

28
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:22,075
Came responsibility.

29
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,802
Something new came upon
the land one night.

30
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:09,737
Something that changed my life 
forever...

31
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:13,543
And so my journey began.

32
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:13,498
A wiser horse might have turned
and ran.

33
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:17,040
But I wanted to know what
strange creature was here.

34
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:55,538
Look.

35
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:00,752
Man, look at that stallion, 
it is beautiful.

36
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:37,820
Follow the horse! Let's go!

37
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:38,703
Look out!

38
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:03,700
Don't you get away!

39
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:06,763
I was scared.

40
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:08,732
I didn't know what was going
to happen to me.

41
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:10,599
At least my mother
and the herd were safe.

42
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:42,250
What seems to be the
problem, gentlemen?

43
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:43,978
We got this crazy one here, Sir.

44
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,087
Really?

45
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:53,057
The army has dealt with
wild horses before.

46
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:55,390
This one will be no different.

47
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:00,996
I remember the first time

48
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:03,507
I saw a rattler curled up in my path

49
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,517
-Induct this animal, Sargent.
-Yes Sir!

50
00:21:07,344 --> 00:21:09,836
This one didn't look like a rattler.

51
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:12,143
But I was still thinking...
snake.

52
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:15,048
Grab him, grab him.

53
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:21,123
Okay Murphy, he's all yours.

54
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:23,523
He's a wild one.

55
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,395
We'll see how wild he is,
when I am done with him.

56
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:36,841
You want a fight, do you?

57
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:49,085
Right.

58
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:15,243
Make sure that's good tight.

59
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:23,811
Murphy, look out! Watch out!

60
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:03,354
Murphy, are you okay?

61
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:11,099
Corporal, round up some volunteers to
take this animal to the stables.

62
00:23:11,403 --> 00:23:15,362
Not the stables. -Sir? 
-The corral.

63
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:17,301
It's time to break that horse.

64
00:25:19,665 --> 00:25:23,123
Sergent. -Yes Sir.
Tight this horse to the post.

65
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:26,599
No food or water. Three days.

66
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:27,500
Yes Sir.

67
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:26,491
My heart galloped through
the sky that night

68
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:29,094
Back to my herd.

69
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:30,696
Where I belonged.

70
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,797
And I wonder if they'd miss me

71
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,373
As much as I miss them.

72
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:31,418
We got a hostile!

73
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,796
Bring him there this way.

74
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,770
Well, what do we have here?

75
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:50,344
We caught him
by the supply wagon, Sir.

76
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,341
Ah, a Dakota.

77
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:58,470
Not as tall as the Cheyenne,
and fine featured as the Crow.

78
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:01,552
Take him away gentlemen,
show him our best.

79
00:28:01,894 --> 00:28:03,758
Corporal, take him to the stock case.

80
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:06,626
Not the stock case. The post.

81
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:08,464
No food or water.

82
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:19,299
What are you looking at boy?

83
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:23,277
He was called Little Creak.

84
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:25,210
And he seemed different from the rest.

85
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:23,904
There were just no end to the 
strange ways of the two legged.

86
00:29:43,395 --> 00:29:47,388
With the Colonel permission, Sir. 
Incoming patrol report hostiles 
headed North.

87
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,733
The railroad has expressed concern, Sir.

88
00:29:50,035 --> 00:29:51,969
They requested additional patrols.

89
00:29:52,904 --> 00:29:53,836
How long has it been, Sergent?

90
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:56,396
Sir?
-The mustang.

91
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,365
How long has it been tide?

92
00:29:58,777 --> 00:30:00,005
Three days, Sir.

93
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:01,441
Good.

94
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:03,474
Fetch my crop and spurs.

95
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:24,460
Take it easy!

96
00:30:27,372 --> 00:30:28,464
Back up! Back up!

97
00:31:25,897 --> 00:31:29,128
You see gentlemen,
any horse can be broken.

98
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:33,862
Move along mustang.

99
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:41,143
There are those in Washington who believe
the West will never be settled.

100
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:46,074
The northern pacific railroad 
will never breach Nebraska.

101
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:54,525
A hostile Dakota will never 
submit to providence.

102
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:00,094
And it is that manner of small thinking.

103
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:02,999
That would say this horse 
could never be broken.

104
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:07,568
Discipline, time, and patience.

105
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,874
Are the three great levelers.

106
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:19,014
Sometimes a horse's gotta do,
what a horse's gotta do

107
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:22,042
And this was one of those times.

108
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:00,850
Get off me!

109
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:29,252
Soldier! Secure that horse!

110
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,181
I wasn't sure
what happened back there.

111
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:40,587
And I wasn't about to stop and ask.

112
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:43,553
All I knew was I was headed home.

113
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,787
I couldn't believe it.

114
00:35:10,221 --> 00:35:14,282
One moment I was free,
and the next... more ropes.

115
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,478
I couldn't understand it.

116
00:37:49,948 --> 00:37:51,916
She treated the scrawny two-legged

117
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:53,314
Like one of our kind.

118
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:54,507
Prancing around him

119
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:56,281
Like a love struck ear ring.

120
00:37:57,522 --> 00:37:59,353
It was down right unnatural.

121
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:11,232
Great mustang, today I will ride you.

122
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:15,545
This ought to be good...

123
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:41,896
Mares.

124
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:50,403
Okay, Rain, lets see if you can teach

125
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:51,999
This mustang some manners.

126
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:09,145
Okay, I admit it

127
00:40:09,353 --> 00:40:10,547
She was charming

128
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:13,522
In a stubborn, irritating kind of way.

129
00:40:14,092 --> 00:40:16,185
So, I let her show me her world.

130
00:41:39,076 --> 00:41:40,737
Bye-Bye horsey.

131
00:43:40,562 --> 00:43:42,223
For the first time in my life,

132
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:45,299
I felt my heart torn two ways.

133
00:43:54,775 --> 00:43:56,141
Give it back!

134
00:43:56,812 --> 00:43:57,540
Mustang!

135
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:52,330
I had to hand to that boy.

136
00:44:52,835 --> 00:44:54,564
He just wouldn't give up.

137
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,351
I'm never gonna ride you, am I?

138
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,584
And no one never should.

139
00:46:16,418 --> 00:46:17,680
You can go.

140
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:24,426
It's okay, go.

141
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:33,257
Go on, get out of here.

142
00:46:35,037 --> 00:46:36,265
Go home.

143
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:44,570
I knew this was hard for her,
and she was scared.

144
00:47:45,607 --> 00:47:49,941
But more than anything,
I wanted to share my homeland with her

145
00:51:44,746 --> 00:51:46,611
I laid beside her that night.

146
00:51:47,182 --> 00:51:51,778
Hoping, praying that somehow
she would be okay.

147
00:51:56,324 --> 00:51:57,882
There are a couple
of horses over there!

148
00:52:23,952 --> 00:52:24,884
Leave her there.

149
00:52:24,953 --> 00:52:26,614
She's not gonna make it.

150
00:52:59,178 --> 00:52:59,804
Oh, Rain!

151
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:04,392
Easy, girl. 

152
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:06,561
Easy.

153
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:10,232
It will be okay. 

154
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:25,804
You saved my life.

155
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:55,860
I'm not gonna hurt you.

156
00:53:56,177 --> 00:53:58,441
Come on, it's gonna be okay.

157
00:57:22,383 --> 00:57:24,044
It'll be alright.

158
00:57:51,146 --> 00:57:52,977
I didn't know
why we were brought here.

159
00:57:53,615 --> 00:57:54,946
What I did know

160
00:57:55,183 --> 00:57:59,276
was we had to find a way to escape,
and get back home.

161
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:09,690
Well, that is it, we're rolling 
the steam over the mountain.

162
00:58:10,265 --> 00:58:12,392
We got six days to connect to Utah.

163
00:58:13,568 --> 00:58:15,058
Move out and gone.

164
00:58:47,027 --> 00:58:48,528
Ready to go!

165
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:39,996
We're almost on the top!

166
00:59:59,774 --> 01:00:02,106
That was the moment I understood

167
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:04,240
They were headed to my homeland

168
01:00:04,312 --> 01:00:05,836
And I had to stop them.

169
01:00:09,652 --> 01:00:11,736
Get back!

170
01:00:13,863 --> 01:00:16,240
Oh, we got to stop!

171
01:00:22,231 --> 01:00:23,198
Hold it!

172
01:00:30,972 --> 01:00:32,599
Get the mules up here!

173
01:04:45,626 --> 01:04:46,854
I don't know where he came from

174
01:04:46,928 --> 01:04:48,122
Or how he got there.

175
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:50,659
But I sure was happy to see him.

176
01:05:57,198 --> 01:05:58,062
I don't believe it.

177
01:05:59,934 --> 01:06:01,094
Go! Go! Run!

178
01:08:08,295 --> 01:08:09,125
Look out!

179
01:08:13,334 --> 01:08:14,130
Where are they?

180
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:15,168
There they are!

181
01:08:40,227 --> 01:08:41,216
Oh no.

182
01:08:44,732 --> 01:08:46,097
Oh yes.

183
01:12:34,094 --> 01:12:36,221
You will always be in my heart.

184
01:12:51,578 --> 01:12:54,945
Take care of her,
Spirit...

185
01:12:55,916 --> 01:12:57,474
Who cannot be broken.

186
01:13:17,438 --> 01:13:19,303
I will miss you, my friend.

187
01:13:37,391 --> 01:13:39,518
I've been waiting
so long to run free.

188
01:13:40,594 --> 01:13:43,563
But that goodbye was harder
than I ever imagined.

189
01:13:45,099 --> 01:13:46,896
I will never forget that boy.

190
01:13:48,068 --> 01:13:50,434
And how we won back
our freedom together.

191
01:16:05,739 --> 01:16:07,172
