3
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,199
âª Our glorious city

4
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,337
âª Was built
by the divinities âª

5
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,175
âª By gods
who saw fit âª

6
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,177
âª To bestow

7
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:53,820
âª The gift of a paradise

8
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:58,558
âª Peaceful and harmonious
Upon âª

9
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,829
âª Us mere mortals
below âª

10
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,168
âª And made El Dorado

11
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:13,340
âª The magnificent
and golden âª

12
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:18,211
âª One thousand years ago

13
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:22,882
âª El Dorado
El Dorado âª

14
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:31,624
âª El Dora-a-a-a-do

15
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,869
Today, we sail...

16
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,238
to conquer
the new world...

17
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:50,210
for Spain, for glory,
for gold!

18
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:54,281
Viva Cortes!

19
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,919
Altivo, eyes forward.

20
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,792
Seven!
All right!

21
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,761
- Yes!
- Partner! Hee-hee!

22
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,697
âª Tons of gold for you
Hey!

23
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,632
âª Tons of gold for me
Hey!

24
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,468
âª Tons of gold for we
Hey!

25
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,205
One more roll!

26
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,473
Uh, guys,
you're broke!

27
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:24,611
- You got nothin' to bet with!
- Oh, yeah? I got this!

28
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,879
- A map!
- A map? - A map!

29
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,317
A map of the wonders
of the new world.

30
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,620
Wow!
Let's have a look.

31
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,925
Uh, Tulio!

32
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,929
- Excuse us, for one moment, please.
- Tulio, look!

33
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,765
El Dorado,
the city of gold.

34
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,968
This could be
our destiny, our fate.

35
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,737
Miguel, if I believed
in fate,

36
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,839
I wouldn't be playing
with loaded dice.

37
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,975
Hmm. Not with the face.
No, no, no, no, no.

38
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,878
No! No! No!

39
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:01,614
I said one more roll!

40
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,883
My map against your cash.

41
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,219
Hmm?

42
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:09,822
All right, peewee.
You're on! Not with those!

43
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:14,561
This time we use my dice.
Ehh, got a problem with that?

44
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,297
No.

45
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,199
I'm going to kill you.

46
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,473
Come on, baby.
Papa needs that crappy map.

47
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,282
Stop that!

48
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:39,352
Show me seven!

49
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,730
- Seven!
- All right!

50
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,799
Seven!

51
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:58,037
There it is! Well,
nice doing business with you.

52
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:03,009
I knew it!

53
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,915
Your dice are loaded!

54
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,518
What?
You gave me loaded dice?

55
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,658
He gave me loaded dice!

56
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:23,630
Guard, arrest him!
You dare to impugn my honor?

57
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,798
He was the one
who was cheating!

58
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,035
Arrest him!
He tricked these sailors and took their money!

59
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,338
Oh, now I'm the thief?
Yes.

60
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,473
Take a look
in the mirror, pal!

61
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,008
Oh, you better give them
that money back, or I'll...

62
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,778
- En garde!
- En garde, yourself.

63
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:42,549
I will give you the honor
of a quick and painless death.

64
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,785
But not with that. Ha!
I prefer to fight fairly. Aha!

65
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:49,489
Well, any last words?

66
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,691
I will
cut you to ribbons,

67
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,760
fool!
Such mediocrity.

68
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,762
Let your sword
do the talking.

69
00:04:55,795 --> 00:05:00,500
I will. It will be loquacious to a fault!
Ha! Take that!

70
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:08,875
- You... mincing, fencing, twit.
- Ah, you fight like my sister.

71
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,711
I fought your sister.
That's a compliment.

72
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,880
Blackguard!
Heathen!

73
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:17,784
Kill him!
- Not the face. Not the face.

74
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,690
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've decided it's a draw.

75
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,825
Thank you all for coming.

76
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:29,696
- You've been great. See you soon.
- Adios!

77
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,999
Congratulations. You're very good.
No. That was good.

78
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,402
Very...

79
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,973
We should have kept our swords,
I think. Y-Yeah.

80
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,109
Yeah, I've got a plan.

81
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:46,779
What is it?
Uh, well... Uh, you...

82
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,149
pet him, and... I'll... Yeah.

83
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:52,752
Run!

84
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,855
Uh, well,
thanks a lot!

85
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,728
Whoa!

86
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,700
There they are!

87
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:11,738
âª Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey âª

88
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,077
Bye. Thank you!

89
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,714
âª Ole

90
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,893
Uhh...
Ohh...

91
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,062
I'll bet
we can make that.

92
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,865
There they are!
- Two pesetas says we can't.

93
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,867
You're on!

94
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:48,775
You lose!

95
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,910
Ohhh! Whoa!
What's happening here?

96
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:54,881
We're both in barrels.
That's the extent of my knowledge.

97
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,226
Okay, Miguel,
we gotta move fast.

98
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,530
On three, we jump out and head for the dock.
Good. Good. Excellent.

99
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,533
One, two, three...

100
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,202
Th-Three!

101
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,171
Three! Ohh!

102
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,174
Three!

103
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:32,652
Uh, you ready? Ah, okay.
One more. Let's go.

104
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:37,657
One, two, three!

105
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,062
Excuse us. Okay.
We're outta here.

106
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:46,733
Who ordered
the, uh, pickles?

107
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,740
Cortes!

108
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:59,979
My crew was as carefully chosen
as the disciples of Christ.

109
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,950
And I will not
tolerate stowaways.

110
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:08,187
You will be flogged.
And when we put into Cuba to resupply,

111
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,290
God willing, you will
be flogged some more...

112
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:13,926
and then enslaved
on the sugar plantations...

113
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,596
for the rest
of your miserable lives.

114
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,831
To the brig.

115
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,868
All right!
Cuba!

116
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,284
Hey, Altivo!
Ah-ta-ta, not for you!

117
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:42,321
You're on half rations.
Orders from Cortes.

118
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:55,968
So, uh, how's the...
How's the escape plan coming?

119
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,339
All right.
All right. Wait!

120
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:03,209
I'm getting something.
Yeah.

121
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,282
Okay!
Here's the plan.

122
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,586
In the dead of night,
you and I grab some provisions, Mm-hm.

123
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,755
Hijack one
of those longboats,

124
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:20,993
and then we row back to Spain
like there's no manana!

125
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,295
Back to Spain, yeah?
Yeah.

126
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,331
In a rowboat.
You got it!

127
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,868
Great. Sensational.
And that-that's your plan, is it?

128
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,771
That's pretty much it.
Well, I like it.

129
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,742
So, how do we get on deck?
Umm.

130
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,645
In the dead of night,
you and I grab some provisions,

131
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:42,181
hijack one of those longboats... Uh, great.

132
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,350
Okay, what's
your idea, smart guy?

133
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,886
Wh-Wh-What do you mean? Don't ask me that!
You're the one with the plans.

134
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,189
Wait, I...
I have an idea.

135
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:53,225
Uh, come on. Give me...
Give me a boost.

136
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,095
Hey, Altivo.

137
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,364
Altivo.

138
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,700
You want a nice apple?
Come and get it.

139
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:04,370
You have to do
a trick for me first.

140
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,806
Huh?

141
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,041
All you have to do
is find a pry bar.

142
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:14,380
A long piece of iron with a hooky thing at the end.
Yeah?

143
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,850
Miguel, you're
talking to a horse!

144
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,887
That's it, Altivo,
find the pry bar.

145
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,756
Yes, find the pry bar.

146
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,759
He can't
understand "pry bar."

147
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,229
He's a dumb horse.
There's no way...

148
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:38,070
Well,
it's not a pry bar.

149
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:57,289
Oh, Altivo.
Oh, thank you, old boy.

150
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,260
Listen, if we can
ever return the favor...

151
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:05,097
For Pete's sake, Miguel,
he's a ruthless warhorse, not a poodle.

152
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,266
Come on,
before he licks you to death.

153
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:11,203
Adios.

154
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,341
Shh, shh. Shh.
Quiet, please.

155
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,144
What's the matter with him?
Oh, he wants his apple.

156
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,380
Well, give it to him
before he wakes the whole ship!

157
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:24,283
Fetch!
Huh?

158
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,793
Hmm?

159
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:39,098
Huh?
Huh?

160
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,938
Altivo! Huh?
Miguel!

161
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,376
Altivo, I'm coming!
Miguel!

162
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,912
Just hang on!
I'm right here, old boy!

163
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,848
Have you lost your mind?
Help is coming!

164
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,252
Ho-o-ly ship!

165
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,155
Whoa!

166
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,865
Loop the rope under the horse!
Yes!

167
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,974
On the count of three,
pull back on the rope.

168
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,010
What?
Three!

169
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,246
Pull!

170
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:36,856
Tulio!
Hey, it worked!

171
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,429
Did any
of the supplies make it?

172
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,999
Well, uh, yes and no.

173
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,271
Ohhh, great!

174
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:57,009
Look on the positive side.
At least things can't get...

175
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,211
Excuse me.
We're you going to say "worse"?

176
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,113
No. No. No?
You're sure?

177
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,515
Absolutely not. I've revised the whole thing.
Okay, because...

178
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,953
Yeah, we're at least in a rowboat.
We're in a rowboat, exactly.

179
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:10,122
You miss nothing.

180
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,411
Ahh!

181
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:07,479
Tulio, did you ever imagine
it would end like this?

182
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,083
The horse
is a surprise.

183
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:15,187
Any...
regrets?

184
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:19,058
Besides dying?
Yeah.

185
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:25,497
I never...
had enough... gold.

186
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:31,037
My regret,
besides dying, is...

187
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,540
our greatest adventure
is over before it began,

188
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:37,609
and no one
will even remember us.

189
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:42,014
Well, if it's
any consolation, Miguel,

190
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,684
you...
made my life...

191
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,486
an adventure.

192
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,190
And if it's
any consolation, Tulio,

193
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:55,461
you made my life... rich.

194
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,949
Is it?
Hmm.

195
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,151
It is!
It's... It's... It's... It's... It's...

196
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,320
It's land!

197
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,298
All in favor of getting back
in the boat, say "aye."

198
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,701
Aye!
Aye! Go!

199
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:52,985
Hey, Miguel!
I could use a little help!

200
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,555
Miguel!
Hello!

201
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,357
Tulio!
We've done it!

202
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,760
What's that? The map?
It's all right here!

203
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:05,031
You still have
the map?

204
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,099
The whistling rock!
The stream!

205
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,136
You kept the map,
but you couldn't grab a little more food?

206
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,371
Even those mountains.
You said so yourself:

207
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,574
It coul be possible.
And it is!

208
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:22,214
It really is...
the map to El Dorado!

209
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,550
You drank seawater,
didn't you? Oh, come on!

210
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,552
I'm not coming on!

211
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:30,322
I wouldn't set foot in that jungle for a million pesetas!

212
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:35,194
- How about a hundred million?
- What?

213
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,497
I just thought that, after all,
since El Dorado is the city of gold...

214
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,101
- What's your point?
- You know, dust, nuggets, bricks,

215
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:45,037
a temple of gold where you can
pluck gold from the very walls.

216
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,039
But you don't
want to go, so let's...

217
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,575
get back into the boat
and row back to Spain.

218
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:53,112
After all,
it worked so well last time. Wait!

219
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,715
Mmm. Wait a minute.
New plan.

220
00:16:56,748 --> 00:17:01,487
We find the city of gold.
We take the gold,

221
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,423
and then we go back to Spain.
And buy Spain!

222
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,325
Yeah!
That's the spirit!

223
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:12,264
Come on, Tulio.
We'll follow that trail! What trail?

224
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:17,669
The trail that we blaze!

225
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,441
That trail
that we blaze!

226
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,847
Oh, no, you don't.

227
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,385
Yeow! Your horse
bit me in the butt!

228
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:42,161
âª Look out new world
Here we come âª

229
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,830
âª Brave, intrepid
Charge!

230
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,665
âª And then some

231
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,604
âª Pioneers of maximum
audacity âª

232
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:57,476
âª Whose resumes show that we are just the team âª

233
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:01,147
âª To live where others merely
dream âª What are you looking at?

234
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,650
âª Building up our head of steam âª Whoa!

235
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,619
âª On the trail we blaze

236
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,693
âª Changing legend
into fact âª

237
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,629
âª We shall
ride into history âª

238
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,266
âª Turning myth into truth

239
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,269
âª We shall surely gaze

240
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:27,839
âª On the sweet unfolding

241
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,309
âª Of an antique mystery

242
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,544
âª All will be revealed

243
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:36,815
âª On the trail we blaze

244
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,185
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

245
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,488
âª On the trail
On the trail we blaze âª

246
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,757
Dinner is served.
Hello.

247
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:50,829
âª Paradise is close at hand

248
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:52,898
âª Shangri-la

249
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:56,768
âª The promised land

250
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,771
âª Seventh heaven on demand

251
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,774
âª Quite unusual nowadays

252
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,511
âª Virgin vistas undefiled

253
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,847
âª Minds and bodies
running wild âª

254
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,552
âª In the man
behold a child âª

255
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,853
âª On the trail we blaze

256
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,891
âª On the trail we blaze

257
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:23,429
âª The trail we blaze

258
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,664
âª Is road uncharted

259
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:31,637
âª Through terra incognita
to a golden shrine âª

260
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,806
âª No place for the traveler

261
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,744
âª To be fainthearted

262
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:43,615
âª We are part of a sumptuous
grand design âª

263
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,685
âª Changing legend into fact

264
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,655
âª We shall ride into history

265
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,391
âª Turning myth into truth

266
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,394
âª We shall surely gaze

267
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,797
âª On the sweet unfolding

268
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,933
âª Of an antique mystery

269
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,670
âª All will be revealed

270
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,344
âª On the trail we blaze

271
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:44,410
Hmm.

272
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:50,582
Miguel. Miguel, wake up.

273
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,653
We're there. Oh, yeah.
We found it. We found it? Oh!

274
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,922
Fantastic!
Where is it? How far?

275
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,724
Right here! Here.
Where? Behind the rock?

276
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,992
No, no.
This is it.

277
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,929
Give me that!
This ca-What?

278
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:07,999
Apparently, "El Dorado"
is native for...

279
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,603
"great, big... rock"!

280
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:20,512
Hey, but I tell you what, I'm feeling generous,
so you can have my share!

281
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:23,515
You don't think Cortes could've
gotten here before us and...

282
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,717
And what? Taken all
the real big rocks?

283
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,053
The scoundrel!
Tulio, you...

284
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,055
We have to think about this.
We've come all this way,

285
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,592
and we-we-we should really,
you know... Get... on...

286
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,994
the horse!

287
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:43,469
No, no, no,
not with the face. Stop.

288
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:47,373
Looks like there's
a pass right over there.

289
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,641
Ohh!

290
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,489
Hyah!

291
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,941
I've...

292
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,611
Uh, hello.
Is this your rock?

293
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,813
Sorry. We were just looking.
We're, uh...

294
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,948
We're tourists!
Tourist.

295
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:33,819
We-We lost our group.
May we go now?

296
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,155
Spears.

297
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,505
Hey! Hey!

298
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,035
Oh, my...

299
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,172
It's... It's...

300
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,042
El Dorado.

301
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,474
Oh!

302
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,746
Mmm. Ah!

303
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:26,758
Well, it was nice working
with you, partner.

304
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,027
Tulio, I just
want you to know...

305
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,696
I'm sorry about
that girl in Barcelona.

306
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:34,165
So... You... You,
f... Behold!

307
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,868
As the prophesies foretold,

308
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:40,572
the time of judgment
is now!

309
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:50,949
Citizens, did I not predict
that the gods would come to us?

310
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,186
Hmm.

311
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,624
My lords,
I am Tzekel-Kan,

312
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:02,728
your devoted high priest
and speaker for the gods.

313
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,063
Hey.

314
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:09,668
I am Chief Tannabok.
What names may we call you?

315
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:13,038
Huh?
I am Miguel.

316
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,708
And I am Tulio.

317
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,377
And they call us
Miguel and Tulio!

318
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,748
Your arrival has been
greatly anticipated.

319
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,116
My lords,
how long will you be staying in El Dorado?

320
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:30,221
Aha! I see you've captured
this temple-robbing thief.

321
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,759
How would you have us punish her?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

322
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,161
My lord, I am not a thief.

323
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:39,264
See, the gods
sent me a vision...

324
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:42,133
to bring them tribute from the
temple to guide them here.

325
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:47,038
My only wish
is to serve the gods.

326
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,846
Release her,
don't ya think?

327
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,349
Then you will begin
by returning this...

328
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:01,352
to its rightful place.

329
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:06,758
My lords, why now
do you choose to visit us?

330
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,228
Enough! You do not question...
the gods!

331
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,898
That's right!
Do not question us,

332
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:17,102
or we shall have to unleash
our awesome and terrible power!

333
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,871
And you don't want that!

334
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:23,374
- Well, yes! We do!
- You do?

335
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,978
Of course we do!
Visit your wrath upon this nonbeliever!

336
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,681
Show us the truth
of your divinity!

337
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:32,417
Divinity!
One moment.

338
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,890
Miguel, you know that
little voice people have...

339
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,092
that tells them to quit
when they're ahead?

340
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,795
You don't have one!
Well, I'm sorry. I got carried away!

341
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:47,465
- Way away!
- Maybe we should tell the truth and beg for mercy.

342
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:49,300
Are you nuts?
We'd be butchered alive!

343
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,203
Yes, but they're
getting suspicious.

344
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,172
And if we don't come up
with some mega-cosmic event...

345
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,477
I'm trying! I'm trying!
I can't think with all these distractions!

346
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:02,814
You... Horse... Think horse.
Think, think, think.

347
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:07,819
I'm on the verge of... Stop!

348
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:36,014
Don't make me
start it up again,

349
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,784
'cause I will.

350
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:46,892
O mighty lords!

351
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,861
Come.
Let me show you to your temple.

352
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,030
All right!
Temple.

353
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,468
Step aside.

354
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:45,016
To commemorate your arrival,
I propose a reverent ceremony at dawn.

355
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:50,488
Ah, then perhaps I could prepare
a glorious feast for you tonight.

356
00:29:50,521 --> 00:29:53,524
Which would
you prefer?

357
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,828
Both.
Both. Both.

358
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,130
Both is good.

359
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,300
My lords.
My lords.

360
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,507
And so dawns
the Age of the Jaguar.

361
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:14,512
Happy new year.

362
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,553
Hey!
Hey. Hey.

363
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:32,597
Tulio. Tulio.
They actually think we're gods.

364
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,634
It's
an entire city of suckers.

365
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,970
We just have to keep
this up long enough...

366
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,207
to load up on the gold and then get the hell out of here!

367
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,976
Tulio, we'll be living
like kings!

368
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,612
- Miguel and Tulio!
- Tulio and Miguel!

369
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,581
Mighty and powerful gods.
Gods.

370
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,451
Hello.

371
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:56,888
Depart, mortal,

372
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:59,624
before we strike you with a lightning bolt.
Mmm. Mmmm!

373
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,429
Beware the wrath
of the gods! Begone!

374
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:07,598
Save it for the high priest,
honey. You're gonna need it.

375
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,101
Miguel,
it's not working.

376
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,603
Miguel!
We've been caught.

377
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:14,672
Oh, no. Don't worry
about me, boys.

378
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:19,577
"My only wish is to serve the gods."
Remember?

379
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,247
- How?
- Well, if you guys want the gold,

380
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,116
then you don't want
to get caught, right?

381
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,321
You're going to need my help.
- What makes you think we need your help?

382
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,424
"Ck-ck."
Are you serious?

383
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,294
I... What... We...

384
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,330
Okay. So, uh,
who are you?

385
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:42,633
Yeah, uh,
what's your angle? No angle.

386
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,403
- I want in.
- In?

387
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,439
On the scam.

388
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,142
There's no scam!
Why would you think there's a...

389
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,945
- Why?
- So I can get out.

390
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,680
I thought she just said
she wanted in?

391
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:58,349
She wants in
so she can get out.

392
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:01,086
Aha! Got it.

393
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,656
- W-Why?
- Think you're the only ones who dream of better things?

394
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,260
Of adventure?
You've got your reasons,

395
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,196
and I've got mine.

396
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,431
Let's not make it
personal, okay?

397
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:17,468
- It's just business.
- Oh.

398
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,405
So when you guys
are ready to go back to...

399
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,607
wherever you came from,

400
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,176
I'm going with you.

401
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,246
No!
Don't think so.

402
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,217
All right. Fine.

403
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,319
After all,
I'm sure you know...

404
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:37,755
the proper rituals for blessing a tribute,
the holiest days on the calendar...

405
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:41,993
Oh, and of course you know
all about Xibalba.

406
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:45,063
Okay? Good luck.

407
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:51,136
See you at the execution.

408
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,471
Wait! Ho... Would you...
Hold it.

409
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:01,046
Deal?
Hmm.

410
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,582
Deal. Not yet.
Let's just see how this works out.

411
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:09,020
Uh-huh.
Well, then I suppose that means you'll want these back?

412
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,159
How'd you get those?
Where was she keeping them?

413
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,728
Call me, Chel,
your new partner. Uh,

414
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,364
that's partner-in-training.

415
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,731
Now, put these on.

416
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:25,136
Your public's waiting.

417
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,538
Do you mind?

418
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,474
No.

419
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,142
Oh! Oh! Oh!

420
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,678
Right. Uh, excuse me.

421
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:37,048
Bye.

422
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:43,054
Mm-mm-mmm!
Maybe they should call this place "Chel Dorado."

423
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:46,091
She's whoo...

424
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,426
Whoa, she's trouble!
Wait a minute! What?

425
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,628
The little voice...
Remember the little voice?

426
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:53,598
Ju-Ju-Just for a second
imagine that you have one.

427
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,534
What would it
be saying about Chel?

428
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:00,638
No. No. Listen.

429
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,407
We are partners.
We are partners.

430
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,411
We have a plan, remember?
Get the gold. Go back to Spain.

431
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:09,614
Yes! And we are
pretending to be gods.

432
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:12,683
Now, put Chel in the mix.
What is the voice saying?

433
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,554
Listen carefully.

434
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:22,393
Chel is off-limits, hmm?
Bravo! Chel is off-limits!

435
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,794
Shake on it.

436
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,731
Off-limits. Mm.
Mm. Mmmm.

437
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,633
Besides, we're supposed
to be gods.

438
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,436
We must avoid
giving in to temptation.

439
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:37,375
Gods. Oh. This is gonna to be tougher than I thought.
Tulio, relax!

440
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:42,180
All you have to do is smile,
act godly and follow my lead.

441
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:48,186
Big smile.
Like you mean it.

442
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,221
A-one, two, three.

443
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:58,729
âª I hardly think
I'm qualified âª

444
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,832
âª To come across
all sanctified âª

445
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:05,670
âª I just don't cut it
with the cherubim âª

446
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,439
Tulio, what are you
talking about?

447
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:11,542
âª There again
they're on their knees âª

448
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,245
âª Being worshipped
is a breeze âª

449
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,814
âª Which rather
suits us in âª

450
00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:20,851
âª The interim âª Interim,
interim It's me and him âª

451
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:24,422
Oh, my God!
âª It's tough to be a god

452
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:28,559
âª Tread where mortals
have not trod âª

453
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:34,765
âª Be deified when really
you're a sham âª

454
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,835
âª Be an object
of devotion âª

455
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:40,871
âª Be the subject of psalms

456
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,541
âª It's a rather
touching notion âª

457
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,911
âª All those prayers
and those salaams âª

458
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:50,481
âª And who am I to bridle

459
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,484
âª If I'm forced
to be an idol âª

460
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,886
âª If they say that
I'm a god âª

461
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,723
âª That's what I am

462
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,759
âª What's more
if we don't comply âª

463
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:04,362
âª With the locals' wishes

464
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:07,565
âª I can see us
being sacrificed âª

465
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,868
- âª Or stuffed
- You have a point there. Very good thinking.

466
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:14,839
âª So let's be gods The perks are great âª Yeah!

467
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,708
âª El Dorado on our plates
Thank you.

468
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:20,278
âª Local feelings
should not âª

469
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,213
âª Be rebuffed
âª Never rebuffed

470
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:25,216
âª I never rebuff a local feeling No,
my friend âª

471
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,652
âª It's tough to be a god

472
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,855
âª But if you get
the people's nod âª

473
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:34,325
âª Count your blessings
Yeah, keep 'em sweet âª

474
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,895
âª That's our advice
It's great advice!

475
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:41,266
âª Be a symbol of perfection

476
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:44,235
âª Be a legend
Be a cult âª

477
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:46,971
âª Take their praise
Take a collection âª

478
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:50,475
âª As the multitudes exalt

479
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:53,411
âª Don a supernatural habit

480
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:56,814
âª We'd be crazy not to grab it âª You got it!

481
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:58,783
âª So sign on two new gods

482
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:02,019
âª For paradise

483
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:05,823
âª Par-a-dise

484
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:36,687
Good morning, my lords!

485
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:40,658
He's back!
Oh, no.

486
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,963
And now it's my turn!

487
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:54,038
The gods have awakened!

488
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,773
Whoa!

489
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,743
Mm-hmm.

490
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:05,650
- Hey, Chel, what's going on?
- It's not gonna be good.

491
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,718
Thank you.

492
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,488
This city has been
granted a great blessing.

493
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:14,992
And what have we done
to show our gratitude?

494
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:18,629
A meager celebration.

495
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:24,335
The god's deserve
a proper tribute!

496
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:26,837
Hmm.
Hmm.

497
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:31,576
The beginning of a new era,
the dawning of a new age...

498
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,445
demands...

499
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,747
sacrifice!

500
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:47,057
I don't like this.
Tulio, we've got to do something.

501
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:58,436
Stop!

502
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,071
Hmm?

503
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,810
This is not
a proper tribute!

504
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,078
You do not
want the tribute?

505
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,947
No. No, no.
W-We want tribute.

506
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,884
Uh, it's just that, uh...
Tulio, tell him.

507
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:20,157
The stars are not in position for this tribute!

508
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,527
Like he says,
the stars...

509
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,495
Can't do it.

510
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,831
Not today.

511
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,102
Ah.

512
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:36,140
Perhaps it is possible
I misread... the heavens.

513
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:40,177
Don't worry about it.
To err is human, to forgive... Hmm.

514
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:46,417
My lords,
may the people of El Dorado offer you our tribute.

515
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,896
My lords,
does this please you?

516
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,499
Yes, very nice.

517
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,801
Certainly acceptable.
Yes, lovely. It'll do.

518
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,737
The gods have chosen!

519
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,739
To Xibalba?

520
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,776
No. No.

521
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,178
To Xibalba!

522
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:17,615
Oh, great.

523
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:33,798
Hey, Chel, um,
what are they doing?

524
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:37,134
They're sending it to Xibalba,
the spirit world.

525
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,739
The spirit world.
I'll take care of it.

526
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:46,143
Um, excuse me, Chief.

527
00:40:46,176 --> 00:40:48,913
The gods have changed their minds about Xibalba.

528
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:56,220
They wish to bask in the reverence
that has been shown them.

529
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:57,688
Stop!

530
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:05,229
They wish to bask!

531
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:08,733
Take the tribute
to the gods' temple!

532
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:14,104
Nice going.

533
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:26,517
Smile while you can.

534
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:40,197
Well, well, well,

535
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,000
what have we here?

536
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,005
Ai-ai-ai.
âª Tons of gold for you, hah

537
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:51,208
âª And tons of gold for me, hoo
âª Tons of gold for we, ah

538
00:41:51,241 --> 00:41:54,845
Not bad for a day's work, eh?
Not bad at all.

539
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:58,583
We just became richer
than the king of Spain.

540
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:04,188
You know, speaking of kings,
the chief and high priest seem a bit, uh, tense.

541
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:06,290
Buenos Dias!

542
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,826
Listen, all we have to do...

543
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:13,263
is keep playing
the o against the other.

544
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:16,233
You know, do a little god dance,
chant some mystic mumbo jumbo,

545
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:18,936
dazzle 'em with some smoke and mirrors
and then get the hell back to Spain.

546
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:23,974
Um, Tulio, how are we gonna
get all this back to Spain?

547
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,711
Ummm...

548
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,913
A boat?
Yeah.

549
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:32,216
Um, we really hate
to be ascending so soon,

550
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,719
but, uh, some urgent
business has come up...

551
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,954
family matters...
and it's just a bit... Yeah, family.

552
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,923
Badda-bing, budda-boom,
you know what I mean.

553
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:42,126
Oh, we expected you
to be staying with us...

554
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,995
for the next...
thousand years.

555
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,197
Well, as we say
in the spirit world,

556
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,968
there's your plan and then...
there's the gods' plan. Mm-hmm.

557
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,871
And our plan, uh, calls for a boat,
'cause we're gonna ascend...

558
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,607
kind of in a horizontal
pattern at first.

559
00:42:56,641 --> 00:43:00,678
And then we're gonna go vertical, uh,
as we get further out to sea.

560
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,981
Hmm. To build a boat
large and glorious enough...

561
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,717
would take... about a week.

562
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,286
A week? Hmm.
Um...

563
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:12,623
I wonder how long it would take Tzekel-Kan to do it.

564
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:16,326
But... But for the gods,
uh, three days.

565
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,362
Uh...

566
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:21,231
Well, if that's the best
you can do.

567
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:25,870
Oh, perhaps if you were not
burdened with so much tribute,

568
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,638
you could leave sooner.

569
00:43:27,672 --> 00:43:30,274
Hmm? Hmm?
I like it here. Miguel?

570
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:33,711
Yep, yep.
Three days is just fine.

571
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:36,380
No, three days is not fine.

572
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,884
This is a real...
Mmm.

573
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:44,154
These... these are the ones... problem.
Oh. Thank you.

574
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:47,291
Miguel, how are we gonna
keep this up for three days?

575
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,326
You worry too much.

576
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,996
No, I worry exactly
the right amount.

577
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:55,065
You can never
worry too much.

578
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,835
We just have to lie low.

579
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:03,240
But, Tulio, this place is amazing!
I mean, I wonder what's...

580
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,843
No! Don't even move!

581
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:07,812
- Tulio...
- You're moving!

582
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:10,047
- A little, but... Come on.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

583
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,182
- Stay!
- I gotta... I...

584
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:16,386
Just... stand there!
I just...

585
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,257
For three days?

586
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,359
Yes! Exactly.

587
00:44:22,392 --> 00:44:26,663
For three days.
Don't even breathe. All right?

588
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,934
All right.
We lie low.

589
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,036
No, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Promise?

590
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,038
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, all right.

591
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:37,374
Great! Good. Okay.

592
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:42,947
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to gloat over my gold.

593
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:48,285
Oh, yum, yum, yum.

594
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,958
It's beautiful,
isn't it? Yeah!

595
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:57,327
You know,
you really shouldn't miss it. I know.

596
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,797
But I-I couldn't.

597
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,800
Go ahead.
I'll cover for you.

598
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:06,837
Oh, good. Thanks.

599
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,106
So, what happened to Altivo?
I don't know.

600
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:13,010
âª Tulio goes for paradise

601
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,446
Hey, what happened to Miguel?
I don't know.

602
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,217
Oh, my God! He's gone!
Miguel's gone!

603
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,419
He's loose!
What am I gonna do?

604
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:26,290
Oh, no, no!

605
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:29,994
Oh, Miguel is right.
You worry too much.

606
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:35,032
Oh. Ooh.

607
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:39,536
Oh, yeah. Oh, oh,
down, down, down, down.

608
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:42,372
No! No!
Big trouble.

609
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,909
Whoa!

610
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:48,278
Look, sweetheart,
we're in the middle of a con here,

611
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:50,547
walking
the razor's edge.

612
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,150
On the one hand, gold!

613
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:57,855
On the other hand,
painful, agonizing failure!

614
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:01,959
I can't afford any tempta...
uh, distractions.

615
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:05,262
So, I'm sorry.
So sorry.

616
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:09,099
But perhaps another time?
Another place, hmm?

617
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:12,402
Too bad.
I'm free now.

618
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,842
I'm... not really sure
I trust you.

619
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,878
Mmm, I'm not really
asking you to trust me.

620
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:24,414
Am I?
Whoo.

621
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,483
'Kay.

622
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,320
Ooh, yeah.

623
00:46:52,542 --> 00:46:56,113
Excuse me. Excuse me?

624
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,983
Hey, where is everybody?

625
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,218
They've been cleared
from the streets, my lord,

626
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:04,521
so the city can be cleansed,
as you ordered.

627
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:06,857
Cleansed?
Yes.

628
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:10,094
So the Age of the Jaguar
can begin,

629
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:12,196
as you ordered, my lord.
Get back in!

630
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,231
- Where are you going?
- Hey, stop that!

631
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:16,200
- Move!
- Hey, stop that!

632
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,468
What are you doing?
Stop that!

633
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,905
But, my lord, anyone
who disobeys your orders...

634
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,573
must be punished,
as you ordered.

635
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,944
It seems I've been giving
a lot of orders, haven't I?

636
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,479
Tzekel-Kan has made
your commands clear, my lord.

637
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,882
Really?

638
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:36,386
Take the day off.
Huh?

639
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,990
Are you all right?

640
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,092
Here.

641
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:48,232
Oh, no!
It's all right. Please.

642
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:04,081
Hey, Altivo.
There you are.

643
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:11,288
Oh.
Oh.

644
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:29,239
âª The more I learn

645
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:33,978
âª The more I see

646
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:38,448
âª The less the world
impassions me âª

647
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:44,288
âª The hungry heart

648
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,724
âª The roving eye

649
00:48:47,757 --> 00:48:49,994
âª Have come to rest

650
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:53,030
âª Do not apply

651
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,535
âª The frantic chase

652
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:01,538
âª The crazy ride

653
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:05,642
âª The thrill has gone

654
00:49:05,675 --> 00:49:08,612
âª I step aside

655
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,447
âª I'd believe

656
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,116
âª In anything

657
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:15,719
âª Were it not for you

658
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:19,589
âª Showing me by just existing

659
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,492
âª Only this is true

660
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:26,263
âª I love you

661
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,166
âª I love you

662
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,202
âª Without question

663
00:49:32,236 --> 00:49:34,038
âª I love you

664
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:37,207
âª I'd believe in anything

665
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:41,011
âª Were it not for you

666
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:46,516
âª Showing me by just existing
Only this is true âª

667
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:50,587
âª Oh, I love you

668
00:50:15,845 --> 00:50:21,151
Hmm. This is not
what I expected.

669
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:24,288
Perhaps Lord Tulio
will enlighten me.

670
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,725
How do I look?

671
00:50:28,758 --> 00:50:32,262
Oh, uh... Well, you...

672
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:34,298
Oh, shut up.

673
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,800
Oh! Whoa!

674
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,069
My lord?

675
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:41,838
- Hello?
- The high priest. - Ow!

676
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:46,176
What's he gonna think if he finds
one of the gods like this with me?

677
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,278
Uh, lucky god?

678
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:50,714
J-Just-Just-Just...

679
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:53,317
Hello?
Whoa!

680
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:57,421
Oh, Tzekel-Kan!

681
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:02,392
What brings you here?
I-I-I-I-I humbly request an audience with you, my lord.

682
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:07,764
- Yes, what can I do for you? - My lord,
I have just seen Lord Miguel out among the people.

683
00:51:07,797 --> 00:51:12,169
- Really?
- If I may be so bold as to offer some advice.

684
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,671
All right. Shoot.

685
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,241
My lord,
you are perfect.

686
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,409
Oh, well. Go on.

687
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:24,614
But in your perfection,
you cannot know how imperfect humans are.

688
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:29,886
Like snakes they are.
Spineless and slippery.

689
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:36,393
They are as untrustworthy as rats,
stealing and cheating with no remorse.

690
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:40,730
Spinning webs of lies,
like spiders!

691
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,567
Stop it!
That's disgusting.

692
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,370
They're beyond disgusting!

693
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:49,473
Yeah, yeah, way beyond.
Then we're in agreement.

694
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:52,209
I'll begin the necessary
preparations immediately.

695
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:56,813
Do you wish to have your victims bound to an altar,
or would you prefer them free-range?

696
00:51:56,846 --> 00:51:59,916
And will you be devouring
their essence whole...

697
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:02,552
or piece by piece?

698
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,189
Tzekel, you've lost me.

699
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:09,259
My lord,
these people will not respect you if they do not fear you.

700
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,695
And, of course, we'll make them
fear us by...

701
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:14,398
A sacrifice,
as it is prophesied.

702
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:18,168
The history of the Age of the
Jaguar will be written in... Ink?

703
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:20,437
Blood!
Blood! Oh, right.

704
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,207
Of course.
I should probably consult with Lord Miguel.

705
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,277
This is fairly important stuff. I, um,
should discuss the entire, uh,

706
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,747
blood issue right away.

707
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,717
Excuse us, won't you?
Let's go.

708
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:39,423
Finally... we're connecting.

709
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,901
This way.

710
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:02,712
What do you think you're doing?
- Lying low.

711
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:05,415
Look, change of plans.

712
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:09,653
We have to grab what we can carry
and get out of here now! What? Why?

713
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,921
Because the high priest
is nuts! He wants...

714
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:14,591
- This is unacceptable!
- Yeah. Yeah. Like he said.

715
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:18,228
The gods should not
be playing ball like this!

716
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:22,866
- Well, exactly!
- This is how the gods should play ball!

717
00:53:26,936 --> 00:53:29,506
Well, don't blame me.
I blame you.

718
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:34,744
What is the object
of this game, pray tell?

719
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:37,247
You've gotta knock the ball
through the hoop.

720
00:53:37,281 --> 00:53:39,015
What hoop?
That hoop.

721
00:53:39,048 --> 00:53:41,785
That's impossible.

722
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,888
- We're gonna lose.
- Gods don't lose.

723
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:50,327
Heep-ha!

724
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,930
My lords, Chief Tannabok's warriors
are the finest ballplayers in the city.

725
00:53:53,963 --> 00:53:58,435
Fifteen mere mortals
against two gods.

726
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,272
I realize it's a bit uneven,
Heep-ha!

727
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:06,776
But I do hope they'll challenge you
enough to make the game... interesting.

728
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:10,947
Play ball!

729
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,917
Crush them into the dust.

730
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,019
Enjoy.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

731
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,764
D'oh. D'oh.

732
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:32,001
My lords,

733
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:35,772
were you not supposed
to put the ball into play?

734
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:37,607
Ohh!

735
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,843
Well,
no, no, no, no, no...

736
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:45,382
We were merely demonstrating the, um, traditional, uh,
first avoidance maneuver.

737
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:48,385
Ah.

738
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,320
I've never heard
of such a thing.

739
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:52,989
Excuse me.

740
00:54:53,022 --> 00:54:55,725
Who invented this game?

741
00:54:55,759 --> 00:55:00,330
Why, the gods,
of course.

742
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:03,733
I'm warning you,
don't push your luck with this guy.

743
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:07,637
But, Tulio,
we're the gods.

744
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,445
Tulio!
The hip! The hip!

745
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:22,719
This is impossible.

746
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:28,458
Excuse me?

747
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:32,729
- Heep...
- Haaa!

748
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,365
Heep-ha! Heep-ha!
Heep-ha! Heep-ha!

749
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,811
Foul! That was a foul!

750
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:55,919
New ball!

751
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,089
How long does this
go on anyway?

752
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:02,859
The game is over when the shadow touches this line.

753
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:06,730
We need a miracle.
No, we need to cheat.

754
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,749
Yes!

755
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,787
Huh?

756
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,889
Hey!

757
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:37,093
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

758
00:56:37,126 --> 00:56:40,096
Ole!

759
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:47,637
Huh?

760
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:51,140
Hmm.

761
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:52,976
Yes!

762
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,744
Who's the god?
You de god.

763
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:57,914
No, you the god.
Fine. No, you de god.

764
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:02,752
Y-Yeah! Yeah!

765
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:13,563
Guys, it's here!
It's right here with me!

766
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,153
Mmm.

767
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:47,531
I love this game!

768
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,799
Yes!

769
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,268
Well done, partner.

770
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:56,005
- Yes! Yes!
- My lords, congratulations on your victory.

771
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:59,075
And now, you will, of course,
wish to have the losing team...

772
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:02,045
sacrificed to your glory.

773
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,182
Not again.

774
00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:08,084
Look, Tzekel-Kan,
Uh, Miguel?

775
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,787
Forget the sacrifices.
Miguel.

776
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,289
We don't want any sacrifices.

777
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:18,161
But all of the sacred writings say that you
will devour the wicked and the unrighteous.

778
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:21,097
Well, I don't see anyone here
who fits that description.

779
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,701
Well, as speaker
for the gods,

780
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:28,938
it would be my privilege
to point them out.

781
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:32,041
The gods are speaking
for themselves now!

782
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:34,310
This city and these people...

783
00:58:34,343 --> 00:58:36,646
have no need
for you anymore!

784
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,885
There will be no sacrifices!

785
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:46,255
Not now, not ever!

786
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:49,893
Get out!

787
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:04,808
Mmm. As the...

788
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:08,645
gods... command.

789
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,716
Whoa! Who-o-oa!

790
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:16,285
Hey, not bad for my
first commandment, huh?

791
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,155
Miguel, the little voice...

792
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:21,324
Yeah, fine.

793
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:27,831
Do you know why
the gods demand blood?

794
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:31,000
I don't know.

795
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:34,671
Because gods don't bleed.

796
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:41,110
It's time to take the future
into my own hands,

797
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:43,780
and this city
will be cleansed.

798
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:46,315
Even if I
have to do it myself.

799
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,852
Uh, how?

800
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:52,989
There are dark magics here...

801
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,692
and power... and...

802
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:58,261
Ooh. My, my, my,
my, my.

803
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:02,098
It's not called the Age of the Jaguar for nothing.

804
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:11,875
This'll be a delightful way to
bid the false gods... good-bye.

805
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,789
Hmm.

806
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:28,892
Audios, muchacho!

807
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:47,410
- Well, it's, um, uh, nice.
- Nice?

808
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:49,278
Yes, nice.
But?

809
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:53,750
Um, but, uh, is it
really fit for the gods?

810
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:55,719
My lord.

811
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:59,789
I have been around boats,
believe me,

812
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:03,326
and that, um...
the pointy, tall, um...

813
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,428
the-the-the-the long
up and down thing...

814
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:08,832
The mast? The mast, yes, yes.
The mast is good.

815
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:12,969
Well, look at it.
There's not nearly enough, uh,

816
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,470
um, rope.

817
01:01:14,503 --> 01:01:17,941
- Rope?
- Yes, rope. Exactly my point.

818
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:21,811
Vertical ascension requires
a lot more, uh, rope.

819
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:26,015
- My lord.
- And look at this.

820
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:29,318
This doesn't look
at all secure.

821
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:35,191
Chief, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
but all in all, it is a complete do-over.

822
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:40,463
Hmm.

823
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,201
You know, Lord Miguel,

824
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:48,004
if you wish to stay,

825
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,940
you only need to say so.

826
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:55,044
- You mean... forever?
- Of course.

827
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:02,418
Oh, no, I can't.
I have to go back with Tulio.

828
01:02:02,451 --> 01:02:04,187
We're... We're partners.

829
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:07,991
Big plans
in the other world, huh?

830
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,795
Yep. Big plans.

831
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:16,299
Well, then, I better
go get some more rope, huh?

832
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:19,502
Oh, Chief, um,
forget about the rope.

833
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,304
Um, my mistake.

834
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:24,473
Hey, to err is human.

835
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:41,157
- Half?
- Mm-hmm.

836
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,993
I don't think so.

837
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:47,563
I-I'll tell you what.
Uh, I'll let you come back to Spain with us,

838
01:02:47,596 --> 01:02:52,001
like you wanted, and, um, yeah,
I can see my way clear to throwing you,

839
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:54,103
mmm, ten percent?

840
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:58,374
You know, maybe I won't go to
Spain with you and take a third.

841
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:00,576
Ohh!

842
01:03:00,609 --> 01:03:03,046
Like you don't
wanna go to Spain.

843
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:05,982
Oh, like you don't want me
to want to go to Spain.

844
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:10,954
I want you to want...
what you want. Mm-hmm?

845
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:12,956
Mm-hmm. Go on.

846
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:16,359
All right.
Cards on the table.

847
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:20,529
Uh, I want you to come to Spain with me and Miguel.

848
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:23,066
Mostly me.
Especially me.

849
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:24,901
Only me.
Forget Miguel.

850
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:31,074
Well, as long as that's
what you want.

851
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:34,010
Me too.
Okay.

852
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:36,045
Deal?

853
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,182
Deal. Mmm.

854
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,256
"Forget Miguel"?

855
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:50,193
Well, forget Tulio.

856
01:04:06,575 --> 01:04:09,312
Well, is it ready yet?

857
01:04:15,118 --> 01:04:16,252
Ooh.

858
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:21,624
Ah!

859
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:23,993
Ahh! Hmm.

860
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:28,664
It seems to be
missing something.

861
01:04:28,697 --> 01:04:31,901
Ah, that's it.

862
01:04:31,935 --> 01:04:36,072
It needs more... body.

863
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:13,042
Do... as I command!

864
01:05:17,646 --> 01:05:19,983
The gods deserve
a proper tribute.

865
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:23,352
Stop! There will be
no sacrifices!

866
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:27,456
That kid does you
better than you do.

867
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,026
Some send-off, huh?

868
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:34,097
We're finally at the "go back to
Spain and live like kings" part.

869
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:41,971
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

870
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:47,610
Well, isn't king kind of a step down from god?

871
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:50,046
What? Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

872
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,316
Miguel, we can't stay here.

873
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,184
We have a plan, remember?

874
01:05:55,218 --> 01:06:00,756
How about...
we forget the plan? Hmm?

875
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:03,459
What?

876
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:16,505
Now everyone will know
the truth of your divinity.

877
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,624
I'm okay!

878
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,027
I'm still okay!

879
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:42,498
Come on! Get on!

880
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:49,272
Altivo, hyah!

881
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:55,444
Whoa!

882
01:07:05,854 --> 01:07:07,490
Tulio!

883
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:12,061
Hey, over here,
you big Tzekel-Kan cat creep!

884
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:15,431
Altivo, get Chel out of here.

885
01:07:27,876 --> 01:07:29,812
Duck!

886
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:40,656
Who-o-o-oa!

887
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:49,798
Move! Move!

888
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:55,371
Jump!

889
01:08:06,815 --> 01:08:09,285
Who-o-o-a!

890
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:16,359
I know what you are,

891
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:18,827
and I know what you are not!

892
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:21,830
And you are not gods!

893
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,536
Y... You're not a god?

894
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,172
You lied to me?

895
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:36,879
How dare you!
Hey, it was his stupid plan!

896
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:41,917
- What?
- Oh, oh, oh. My plan was that we should lie low!

897
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:47,456
But your plan was to run off and be all "Oh,
look at me. Look at me. I'm a god."

898
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:50,326
- That's not true!
- No? Who are you kidding?

899
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,295
You're buying your own con!

900
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:54,330
At least I'm not dating mine.

901
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:57,833
I... Ooh, low blow.

902
01:08:57,866 --> 01:09:01,604
Listen, Mr. High and Mighty, we'd both be
sailing out of here with a mountain of gold...

903
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:04,240
if you had just
listened to me!

904
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:09,412
Well, now you've got all the precious gold and Chel.
So what do you need me for?

905
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:12,281
Well, maybe I don't
need you anymore.

906
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:15,551
Well, then, why don't you just go back to Spain,
and I'll stay here,

907
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:17,486
and we'll both
get what we want!

908
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,689
- That's... fine with me, pal!
- Fine with me too! - Ooh.

909
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:22,591
- Fine! - Ouch.
- Okay!

910
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:26,229
All right!

911
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:28,264
Tie him up!

912
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,566
What?

913
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:32,435
Whoa.

914
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:34,970
Jump!

915
01:09:35,003 --> 01:09:37,240
Whoa!

916
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:51,520
No-o-o-o-o!

917
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:19,848
My lord.

918
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:28,757
Where did you get this?

919
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:36,765
That was good, huh?

920
01:10:56,652 --> 01:10:59,822
Hey, a little help, please?

921
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:04,793
Chief Tanni! Chief Tanni!

922
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:09,365
- I've decided to stay.
- Oh, this is wonderful news.

923
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:11,867
What a glorious day
for El Dorado.

924
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:15,838
Lord Miguel has decided
to live among us!

925
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:18,441
Tulio!

926
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:22,511
Is everything okay?

927
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:29,818
Everything is... fine.

928
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:53,476
âª There isn't much

929
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:56,779
âª I haven't shared

930
01:11:56,812 --> 01:12:00,816
âª With you along the road

931
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:05,754
âª And through it all
there'll always be âª

932
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:09,725
âª Tomorrow's episode

933
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:13,729
âª Suddenly that isn't true

934
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:18,701
âª There's another avenue

935
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:22,438
âª Beckoning the great divide

936
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:25,107
âª Ask no questions

937
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,543
âª Take no side

938
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:31,680
âª Who's to say
who's right or wrong âª

939
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:36,118
âª Who's course is braver run

940
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:39,788
âª All I know is all we had

941
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:43,592
âª Is over

942
01:12:43,626 --> 01:12:45,127
âª Said and done

943
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:54,737
âª Friends never say good-bye

944
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:59,107
âª Friends

945
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:03,746
âª Never say good-bye

946
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,783
Ha!

947
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:21,664
Ahhh! Whew!

948
01:13:32,675 --> 01:13:36,912
Mmm.
âª Friends never say good-bye

949
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:41,149
Take care.

950
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,085
We'll miss you!
Thank you.

951
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:47,022
âª Never say good-bye

952
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:10,746
âª Friends never say

953
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:13,181
âª Good-bye

954
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:16,752
âª Friends

955
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:21,990
âª Never say good-bye

956
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:25,794
Well, good luck.

957
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:29,865
Yeah. You too.

958
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:34,570
âª Never

959
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:38,140
âª Say good-bye

960
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:51,820
Whoa.

961
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:55,190
Whoa, boy, what is it?

962
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:04,032
- Cortes.
- My lord, what is it?

963
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:07,770
Chief Tanni!
Chief Tanni!

964
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:11,907
Approaching the city...
is an army of strangers.

965
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:16,311
We are safe here.
They'll never find the gate to the city.

966
01:15:16,344 --> 01:15:20,749
But, sire, they are being led
by Tzekel-Kan.

967
01:15:20,783 --> 01:15:25,020
He survived! Warriors,
prepare yourselves for battle!

968
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,692
Chief, you cannot fight them!

969
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,894
Then how can we stop them?

970
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:34,029
We can't.

971
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:43,606
Hmm.

972
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:46,241
Uh, one moment, please.

973
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:51,279
Okay, here's the gate.
Here's the boat. Uh-huh. And?

974
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:53,816
Here's the gate.
Here's the boat. Okay.

975
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:57,786
Got that. And? Tulio! Well, here's the "goat,"
and here's the "bate."

976
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:04,993
That's it.

977
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:07,262
We'll crash the boat
into the pillars.

978
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:10,766
That's it?
I mean... But...

979
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:15,137
What about the gold?
Well...

980
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:17,740
Chief!

981
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:19,341
Chief.

982
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:21,977
I've got a plan.

983
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:35,758
Hold the line steady!
They're almost in place!

984
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:43,598
It better be there,
for your sake.

985
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:06,889
Okay, Chief, on my signal!

986
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:09,858
Ready! Hit the pillars!

987
01:17:09,892 --> 01:17:13,628
Now!

988
01:17:24,472 --> 01:17:27,042
- They're breaking too fast!
- Tulio, the sail!

989
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:32,280
It's stuck!

990
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:45,460
They're not gonna make it.
Altivo!

991
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:58,406
Are you crazy?

992
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:17,459
Get off the boat, Miguel,
or you'll never see the city again.

993
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:21,730
I know. You don't think I'm gonna
let you have all the fun, do you?

994
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:25,100
Come on.
We've got a wave to catch.

995
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:53,228
- Get out of the way!
- Huh?

996
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:54,763
Hold on!

997
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,807
Whoa!

998
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:15,483
We're gonna have to
hit it broadside!

999
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:18,921
That's your plan?
But the gold!

1000
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:21,223
I know!

1001
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:24,326
Just turn the boat!

1002
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:27,863
On impact, everybody jump!

1003
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:01,296
We made it.

1004
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:05,600
It worked.
It worked.

1005
01:20:05,633 --> 01:20:09,004
Wait. Get down!
Ouch. Ow.

1006
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:11,306
There they are.

1007
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:31,559
No.

1008
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:42,304
You lying heathen.

1009
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,172
There's nothing here at all.

1010
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:46,875
No. Wait. Wait.

1011
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:52,147
- Men, seize him!
- What?

1012
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:57,285
There is no El Dorado here.
Onward, men.

1013
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:08,964
Wait! No, wait!

1014
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:12,100
Wait!

1015
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:26,281
- Yes!
- Now, that was an adventure.

1016
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:28,683
Yes. Yes, it was.
And, um,

1017
01:21:28,716 --> 01:21:34,589
it was so much gold!

1018
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:41,930
I'm fine.
Good.

1019
01:21:41,964 --> 01:21:43,999
Let's go.

1020
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:51,406
Partner.

1021
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:57,145
Partner.

1022
01:21:57,179 --> 01:22:00,215
Hey, guys, come on!

1023
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,184
You don't wanna stay here
forever, do you?

1024
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:06,121
But... we don't have a map.
We don't have a plan.

1025
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:08,323
Well, that's what
makes it interesting.

1026
01:22:08,356 --> 01:22:12,194
You're right!
What are we waiting for?

1027
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:14,029
Let's follow
that trail!

1028
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:16,331
Hyah!

1029
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:20,668
âª Oh, the sweet unfolding
Come on, boys!

1030
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:23,171
âª Of an antique mystery
Hey, Altivo!

1031
01:22:23,205 --> 01:22:26,508
âª All will be revealed Sit, boy! Sit!

1032
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:30,745
Chel, we're not
on the horse!

1033
01:22:30,778 --> 01:22:33,581
âª On the trail we blaze

1034
01:22:39,687 --> 01:22:42,257
Uh-Uhh.

1035
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,758
Eh!

1036
01:22:43,791 --> 01:22:47,195
âª Here comes the night

1037
01:22:47,229 --> 01:22:49,764
âª Here come the memories

1038
01:22:49,797 --> 01:22:52,700
âª Lost in your arms

1039
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:55,737
âª Down in the foreign fields

1040
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:59,274
âª Not so long ago

1041
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:01,543
âª Seems like eternity

1042
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:06,348
âª Those sweet afternoons

1043
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:10,118
âª Still capture me-e-e

1044
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:16,691
âª Someday out of the blue

1045
01:23:16,724 --> 01:23:18,693
âª In a crowded street

1046
01:23:18,726 --> 01:23:22,697
âª Or a deserted square

1047
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:25,467
âª I'll turn and I'll see you

1048
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,470
âª As if our love were new

1049
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:31,706
âª Someday we can start again

1050
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:34,509
âª Someday soon

1051
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:39,681
âª I still believe

1052
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:42,684
âª I still put faith in us

1053
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:45,687
âª We had it all

1054
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,690
âª And watched it slip away

1055
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:51,726
âª Where are we now

1056
01:23:51,759 --> 01:23:54,396
âª Not where we want to be

1057
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:59,167
âª Those hot afternoons

1058
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:02,804
âª Still follow me-e-e

1059
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:09,144
âª Someday out of the blue

1060
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:11,613
âª Maybe years from now

1061
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:15,083
âª Or tomorrow night

1062
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:18,253
âª I'll turn and I'll see you

1063
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:21,289
âª As if we always knew

1064
01:24:21,323 --> 01:24:24,126
âª Someday we would live again

1065
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:27,429
âª Someday soon

1066
01:24:29,797 --> 01:24:35,803
âª I still believe I still put faith in us âª âª Believe

1067
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:42,110
âª I still believe
I still put faith in us âª

1068
01:24:42,144 --> 01:24:47,815
âª I still believe I still put faith in us âª âª Believe

1069
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,857
âª Here comes the night

1070
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:58,826
âª Here come the memories

1071
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,829
âª Lost in your arms

1072
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:04,632
âª Down in the foreign fields

1073
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:08,470
âª Not so long ago

1074
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:10,572
âª Seems like eternity

1075
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:15,277
âª Those sweet afternoons

1076
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:20,215
âª Still capture me-e-e

1077
01:25:22,817 --> 01:25:27,422
âª Someday out of the blue

1078
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:29,591
âª Maybe years from now

1079
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:33,261
âª Or tomorrow night

1080
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:36,231
âª I'll turn and I'll see you

1081
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:39,167
âª As if we always knew

1082
01:25:39,201 --> 01:25:41,936
âª Someday we would live again

1083
01:25:41,969 --> 01:25:44,572
âª Someday soon

1084
01:25:57,419 --> 01:26:00,222
âª The more I learn

1085
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:05,193
âª The more I see

1086
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:14,702
âª The less the world
impassions me âª

1087
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:20,842
âª The hungry heart

1088
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:25,780
âª The roving eye

1089
01:26:28,015 --> 01:26:30,852
âª Have come to rest

1090
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:34,589
âª Do not apply

1091
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:41,629
âª The frantic chase

1092
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:46,768
âª The crazy ride

1093
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:51,839
âª The thrill has gone

1094
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:57,779
âª I step aside

1095
01:26:57,812 --> 01:27:00,515
âª And I'd believe

1096
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:03,451
âª In anything

1097
01:27:03,485 --> 01:27:06,388
âª Were it not for you

1098
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:10,558
âª Showing me

1099
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:13,561
âª By just existing

1100
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:18,266
âª Only this is true

1101
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:22,770
âª I love you

1102
01:27:22,804 --> 01:27:28,443
âª I love you

1103
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:31,579
âª Without question

1104
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:35,983
âª I love you

1105
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:53,034
âª The more I want
âª The more I steal

1106
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:58,406
âª The more I steal
âª The more I hold

1107
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,075
âª The more I hold

1108
01:28:01,108 --> 01:28:05,380
âª The less is real

1109
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:13,721
âª All worldly things
âª I follow blind

1110
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:19,427
âª I follow blind
âª In hope, not faith

1111
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:21,629
âª In hope, not faith

1112
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:25,800
âª Was paid in kind

1113
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:32,340
âª The line is drawn

1114
01:28:34,742 --> 01:28:37,445
âª The change is made

1115
01:28:39,714 --> 01:28:42,717
âª I come to you

1116
01:28:45,019 --> 01:28:48,656
âª I'm not afraid

1117
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:50,892
âª And I'd believe

1118
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:53,961
âª In anything

1119
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:56,931
âª Were it not for you

1120
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:01,669
âª Showing me

1121
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:04,572
âª By just existing

1122
01:29:04,606 --> 01:29:07,341
âª Only this is true

1123
01:29:08,976 --> 01:29:10,778
âª I love you
