{61575}{61661}-there's your plan and then...|there's the gods' plan.|-Mm-hmm.
{61664}{61732}And our plan, uh, calls for a boat,|'cause we're gonna ascend...
{61734}{61795}-kind of in|a horizontal pattern at first.|-[Chuckles]
{61798}{61893}And then we're gonna go vertical,|uh, as we get further out to sea.
{61895}{61972}Hmm. To build a boat|large and glorious enough...
{61975}{62037}would take... about a week.
{62040}{62103}-A week? Hmm.|-Um--
{62106}{62179}I wonder how long it would take|Tzekel-Kan to do it.
{62182}{62272}But-But for the gods,|uh, three days.
{62275}{62320}Uh--
{62323}{62389}Well, if that's the best you can do.
{62391}{62491}Oh, perhaps if you were not burdened|with so much tribute,
{62494}{62540}you could leave sooner.
{62542}{62605}-Hmm?|-Hmm? I like it here. Miguel?
{62608}{62684}Yep, yep.|Three days is just fine.

{63016}{63063}You worry too much.
{63066}{63118}No, I worry exactly the right amount.
{63121}{63197}You can never worry too much.
{63199}{63264}We just have to lie low.
