1
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,600
Damned teenagers!
You'd better not in my field making out.

2
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,480
Not in front of my pumpkins.
Now scram!

3
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,760
Back in my day, we had respect
for a man's vegetables.

4
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,840
Kids with your far-out hippies loving...
What in the...?!

5
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,240
MONSTERS VS ALIENS
Mutant Pumpkins from outer space

6
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,960
Oh yeah, the classic
- That was very scary.

7
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,760
Do the creature from "The blue lagoon".

8
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,520
No, not again!
Stop, stop! Have you stopped yet?

9
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,720
What do you think I should be for Halloween?
Chewing gum, football, baseball...

10
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,880
melting snowball. Solar system?
Bad Elvis? "Thank you very much".

11
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,960
You as bad Elvis?
Actually, yeah. Maybe...

12
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,520
Guys, good news! Looks like that Yeti sighting
was just a hokes. So we got the night off.

13
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,840
Enjoy your coffee. It's normal.

14
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,960
Noone is in it.

15
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,280
This could use a little more milk.

16
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,800
Jeez, where is your Halloween spirit?

17
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,240
Hey, I got plenty of Halloween spirit. Just wait
till you see my Zombie cheerleader costume.

18
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,680
Now, where will I get some really huge pom poms?
- Susan...

19
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,360
...you are a real monster now, and that means
you're playing in the big league with the big boys.

20
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,400
I got 50 years of misted Halloween all
smushed up tight inside me just bursting to get out.

21
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,600
This isn't just any night.
It is our night, and when it finally comes...

22
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,080
we got to terrify...
- Perhaps, my fiend friend...

23
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,120
But for some of us all Hallows' Eve
is more trick then treat

24
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,360
I was but a lad. My head filled with dreams
of particle physics and candy.

25
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,600
Sweet candy.

26
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,240
The future before me seemed sugar-coated.
Until...!

27
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,840
My swirly pop!

28
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,440
From that dark day forth,
Halloween was dead to me... forever.

29
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,520
You know, I kinda want to throw you
in the trash right now.

30
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,520
Come on, guys. Like you said, it's our night, right?
So, let's get out and have some fun.

31
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,880
Fun time is over, monsters!
It's a no-go. I repeat, a no-go on Halloweens!

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,240
Yes!
- We got us a major situation.

33
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:05,240
A UFO has entered our airspace over California.
And you ain't going to believe where...

34
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,160
Modesto? Why is it always Modesto?
- I thought it was kinda freaking myself.

35
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,360
Any idea what we are facing, general?

36
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,800
Invasion? Abductions? Croaps?

37
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,120
Unknown. And I hate these some unknow.

38
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,000
So I want you on the ground and searching Modesto
for possible alien intruders.. asap.

39
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,600
Better yet. Pronto!
And let's keep this on a 'need to know' basis.

40
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,480
Meaning: nobody needs to know!
- But what about my parents?

41
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,040
No, not even your parents. It's Halloween after all,
we don't want to go around scaring folks.

42
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,360
Hello? Hey, get down here.
They're giving away pumpkins.

43
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,360
And it looks like they're going fast.

44
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,560
"Free pumpkins for all humans".
I'm a human. Sign me up.

45
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,400
Nobody does Halloween like the Murphys.
- We did it again, Carl.

46
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,160
Susie Q!

47
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,720
Mum! Dad!
I'm so glad to see you.

48
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:33,280
Oh honey, I can't believe you came.
- I finally managed to get a night off. So, I'm here.

49
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,840
But you're always so busy saving the earth.
It's not healthy.

50
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,520
Yes, we were starting to think Modesto would have
to get invaded by aliens again to see our daughter.

51
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,000
Stop! It's just ridiculous.

52
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,800
Yes, we're just here for the party,
mr and mrs Murphy.

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,040
If indeed that's who you actually are!

54
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,120
They're clear.

55
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,960
Clearly ready to throw
the best Towelie party in Modesto?

56
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,520
Oh, we went all out this year, hon.
I included all your own favourites...

57
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:11,080
death by chocolate fountain...
??? wicked witches, candy-poison appletree and...

58
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,080
children of the candy cornfield!

59
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,920
Yeah, not bad, but you know...

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,080
Call me when it's real candy.
You know what I'm saying...

61
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,160
B.O.B., it is real candy.

62
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,040
Oops... Hey guys,
since everything looks fine here,

63
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,400
why don't you go out
and do some 'Trick or Treat'-ing...

64
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,080
You know. Check out the neighbourhood.
- Of course. We'll keep an eye out... for candy.

65
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,200
Wait, where are we going? There is candy in here.
- You're coming, B?

66
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,160
Just try and stay... focused.

67
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,640
Susan, maybe you and your ma can start pealing
the grapes for the eyeballs salad.

68
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,440
I've got to get the farmer's Jeb patch.

69
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,640
Not to point the finger, but...
we need more pumpkins.

70
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,480
No...! Sorry.

71
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,240
Euh, it's not save out there.
You know, kids throwing eggs.

72
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,640
You could get TPed.
So, I'll go get the pumpkins.

73
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,080
It's quite simple, BOB. You ring the doorbell,
then repeat the following: Trick or Treat.

74
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
They offer you candy...
They're almost slightly human.

75
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,560
They offer to probe you...
They're almost slightly not.

76
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,880
Wait. They give candy to us!
For free! Are they crazy?

77
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,880
That free candy comes with a price, BOB.
Now focus, we have a mission to attend to.

78
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,480
Oh, this is ridiculous. I've waited 50 years
to scare the caramel out of these kids.

79
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,200
I can't wait any longer.

80
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,640
Just, tell them I got sick, or something.
I do a makeup mission later. I've got to go..

81
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,160
B.O.B!

82
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,520
Fine. I'll do it myself.

83
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,160
Trick or treat. Trick or treat.

84
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,240
Happy Hallowee...

85
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,000
This won't hurt a bit.

86
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,040
All clear.

87
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,280
Oh my god, it's Shrek!
Honey, bring the camera!

88
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,480
Say 'cheese'!
- Trick or treat. Trick or treat. Got it!

89
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,600
All clear.

90
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,160
What?
- Hey there, little genius. You're dressed like me.

91
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,440
Uhm, no. I'm dressed as the Missing Link,
you're dressed like a fat old mermaid.

92
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,080
Yeah, since when does Link have a beer gut?

93
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,200
What is happening right now?

94
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,680
I believe what my colleague intended to say,
was "Trick or Treat".

95
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,080
Oh, what an inventive costume, dear.
Really quite discusting.

96
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,200
You deserve something special.

97
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,600
A swirly pop?
For me?

98
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,400
And this time, no pimply hooligans
will deprive me of my lickable loot.

99
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,560
Come, B.O.B.
We have a new prime directive... candy!

100
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Trick...

101
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,360
Come on, Link! Let's here
to be the best Halloween ever.

102
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,960
Look, mammy! It's Kermit.
- Ridiculous...

103
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,320
Biggest one in a patch, son.

104
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,480
Because that's how we roll.
- I'm going to call you...

105
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,760
Wicked Jack.

106
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:08,160
That's perfect, son.
Now, what'd say that we gut this sucker?

107
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,040
Waw, that almost looks real, hon?

108
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,480
Booh!

109
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,880
You can talk?!
You just...

110
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,880
Farmer Jeb? Hello?
Jeb?

111
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,680
Hello, guys, are you there?
- Susy.

112
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,600
Are you seeing anything?
I'm just outside of town, and there's nothing.

113
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,000
Not even weird old farmer Jeb.

114
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,720
Same here, Sus.
I think that this is just one big...

115
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,760
Link, are you alright?
What happened?

116
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,520
<i>Sorry, Susan. Creapy clown costume.</i>

117
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,640
<i>But everything is simply delightful here.</i>

118
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,960
<i>No, B.O.B., put it down!
That is my butter picker. A trade is a trade</i>

119
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,600
<i>We'll be in touch, Susan.
Over and out.</i>

120
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,360
Is anybody in there?

121
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,000
They're alive!

122
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,800
<i>Oh, look at that. Everybody is having such fun.
- What's happening?</i>

123
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,080
To think I've spent all those years
poo poop-oing Halloween.

124
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,200
Link, I own you an apology.

125
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,600
Can we, please, forget Halloween,
and find these stupid...

126
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,840
pumpkins.

127
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,200
If I wouldn't have a cockroach head myself...
I'd be freaking out right now.

128
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,680
Hey, pal, you're about to get cool whipped.
- Wait, I think I can reason with them.

129
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,680
My mother was a tomato.
I speak 'Pro Juice'.

130
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,440
What did he say?
- Horrible things, about my mother...

131
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,640
in a salad bar.

132
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,080
Whatever you're after, you won't get it here.

133
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,360
Let go! That is my candy!

134
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,720
Galileo's clock!

135
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,520
Link! Whatever mutated these pumpkins
gave them a sweet tooth.

136
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,840
It's not the children, they're after!
It's the candy...

137
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,680
No!

138
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,040
Just like us. The more candy they eat
the bigger they'll get.

139
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,400
Until the whole world becomes their pumpkin punch.

140
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,960
I'm looking at you, stemhead!

141
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,920
Go away, pumpkin thing.
You're not getting one more piece of candy.

142
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And you're definitely not getting
what's at the Murphy house.

143
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,360
She's right down the street, right there.

144
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,280
Susan! We have a problem.

145
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,600
Only 20 minutes till the party begins.
I get the feeling it's going to be a mad house.

146
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,840
You know it, Wendy!
You think we overdid it on the candy?

147
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,160
You've messed with the wrong monsters, pumpkin.

148
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,200
Nobody steals candy on my watch.
- Nobody freaks these kids out but me.

149
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,800
I'm thinking. Stop pressuring me.
- I hope somebody brought the Net mag.

150
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,320
Halloween belongs to monsters,
and this monster's a pumpkin crushing giant.

151
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,160
Apparently, you're a giant crushing pumpkin!

152
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,520
Well, you'll never get this candy!

153
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,440
Come on, guys!
I can't do this alone.

154
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,040
You know what? Never mind, I can.

155
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,920
I can't believe I'm actually fighting a vegetable.

156
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,000
No!

157
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,640
Technically, he's a fruit, Susan.

158
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,080
In your face, pumpkin! Get it?
Oh no, don't punch yourself.

159
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,440
Oh man, this wasn't the best strategy after all.

160
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,720
Or maybe, it was. If it's candy he wants,
let's give it to him...

161
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,760
It makes them bigger.

162
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,200
Bigger... and bigger... and nausear.

163
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Yes! Loops the lawn and shake the trees.

164
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,760
Kids! Get every piece of candy you can find.

165
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,280
Hold on the fort, children.

166
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,400
Look, it's Missing Link!
- Do you like that?

167
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,560
Say hello to my little friend.

168
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,200
Get some!

169
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,960
It's working!

170
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,800
Let's not overdo it.

171
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,720
Oh, no!

172
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,480
Get a few more pieces!
- We're all out

173
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,120
There must be some...

174
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,560
Farewell...
My precious.

175
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,480
Happy Halloween!

176
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,720
Mum. Dad.
Just give me a sec, ok?

177
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,120
Nobody ruins a Murphy Halloween.

178
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,680
I'm going to say "Trick".

179
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,960
No!

180
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,360
Elvis!
I knew you were still alive.

181
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,360
A swirly pop!

182
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,040
So I guess you did just come into town
to stop an alien invasion...

183
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,720
and not to visit your parents.
- I'm sorry. I can tell you about this.

184
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,960
And I wish I could make it home more often, but...
- Oh, it's ok, Susie Q.

185
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,640
From now on, your mum and I are just
going to have to get used to...

186
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,280
sharing you with the world.

187
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,560
I think you need to talk to those people
about a raise.

188
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,920
Your mother is right, honey.
How are the benefits?

189
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,880
You know what, dad?
They're pretty awsome.

190
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,720
Oh, speaking of awsome...
Who wants to buffer up home?

191
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,240
You got it, Carl. Just stick your face in my body.
- B.O.B?

192
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,440
Booh!

193
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,760
Still got it.

194
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,600
Well done as always, monsters.

195
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,040
I love the smell of mutating pumpkin guts
in the evening.

196
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,000
Smells like... victory.

197
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,800
Also little like pie.
- Glad you could make it to our party, general.
