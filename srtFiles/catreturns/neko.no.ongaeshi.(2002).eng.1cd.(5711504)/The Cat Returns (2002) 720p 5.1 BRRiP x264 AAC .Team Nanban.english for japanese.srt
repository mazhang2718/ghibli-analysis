Really...

13
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,460

Oh, so delicious.

17
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,930
Not fair.

18
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,390
Bye.

00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,700
Why?

36
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,910
What's wrong with me?

37
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,290
Well, this must be a sign.

40
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,970
That's an unusual cat.

41
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,980
What's so great about Machida?

42
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,230
He's just so cool!

Have you told him that?

He seems to have a girlfriend.

She's a freshman and
very good-looking.

46

Good, if he dumps you...

51
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,550
Had something in his mouth.

52
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,500

53
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,420
Who knows...

54

56

Anyway. It's just a cat.

58

Wait, Haru!

60

Are you OK?

64
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you for saving me
from a dangerous situation.

65
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,500
I hope you haven't injured yourself.

66
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,630
Please excuse me,
but I really must be going now.

67
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,640
Allow me to express
my gratitude later.

68
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
Don't mention it.

69
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,560
Haru!

70
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,320
Ah, you broke it.

71
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,360
Never mind, a cat's life is
more important.

72
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,610
Did you see that?

73
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,300
Huh?

74
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,200
The cat bowed to me.

75
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,700
Haru... Did you hit your head?

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,460
I'm home.

77
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,590
Don't step on that!

78
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,800
Sorry. I can't decide
which pattern to use.

79
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,260
Honey, can you make dinner?

80
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,180
Mom.

81
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,190
Can cats talk?

82
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,940
Well... Let's see.

83
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,150
What?!

84
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,030
Come to think of it,
you said so before.

85
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,990
Really?

86
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,700
When you were very small,

87
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,000
you used to say
"I can talk with cats."

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,370
Did I?

89
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,330
Yes, don't you remember?

90
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,230
What's wrong?

91
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,950
I see, you're hungry.

92
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,450
Do you like fish?

93
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,580
OK, take these.

94
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,000
You're so dirty...

95
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,580
Good?

96
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,170
OK, OK.

97
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,840
More?

98
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,840
Good girl.

99
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,090
Eat them all.

100
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,060
No need to thank me.

101
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,020
Haru.

102
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,900
Oh, Mom!

103
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,480
What were you doing?

104
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,570
Talking with a cat.

105
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,110
Remember I asked you what did you
talk about with the cat?

106
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:09,660
Then you said, "She told me it's
tough to make a living in this world."

107
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,660
and I thought it was so funny.

108
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,840
I guess that did happen.

109
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,340
Anyway, I'll get up
early tomorrow

110
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,760
in time for breakfast.

111
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,340
Uhm... Over here please.

112
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,220
A little closer.

113
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,150
Allow me to introduce.

114
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,530
The King of the Kingdom of Cats.

115
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,570
A King among Kings.

116
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,030
The Cat King.

117
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,450
That's me.

118
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,370
The cat you saved today was

119
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,710
the son of the King, Prince Lune.

120
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,510
Given the importance
of the matter,

121
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,720
the King himself has come to
show his gratitude.

122
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,270
Uh... Mhh...

123
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,930
Thank you.

124
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,650
This is the program.

125
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,280
From tomorrow,

126
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,080
countless joys will befall you.

127
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:39,960
Thank you.

128
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,460
See you.

129
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,700
A dream?

130
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,500
You're saying...

131
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,340
It really wasn't you
who did this?

132
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,210
I have no idea.

133
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,470
Then who did it?

134
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,680
Haru!

135
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,350
Haru, hurry up!

136
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,480
<i>What is this?!</i>

137
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,070
Cattails!

138
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,400
Oh, I work too hard.
I'll be in bed today.

139
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,540
No!

140
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,210
Why?

141
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,840
Haru, it's this one, see?

142
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,800
Morning!
Sorry. Got to run.

143
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,350
What's she up to?

144
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,230
You think she has catnip?

145
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,100
Catnip? Why?

146
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,020
Don't know.

147
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,320
Hey, Yoshioka!
Leave your cats at home.

148
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,530
They're not mine.

149
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,530
What is this?

150
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,330
It wasn't a dream.

151
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,290
<i>It was those cats that did this.</i>

152
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,250
Was it a mistake to save a cat?

153
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,760
Haru.

154
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,180
Wha... What is it?

155
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,430
Did you get rid of
the catnip smell?

156
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,560
Yeah. It seems OK

157
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,390
and the cats aren't after me
anymore.

158
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,890
That's good.

159
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:32,440
Yeah.

160
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,520
Say, can I ask you a favor?

161
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,360
Can you take my turn
for clean-up?

162
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,650
Tsuge-chan has a game today

163
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,320
and I can't make it if I don't
leave right now.

164
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,450
Please!

165
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,200
Oh... Sure...

166
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,620
Clean-up, right?

167
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,170
Thank you, Haru!

168
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,170
Tsuge-chan! Go for it!

169
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,140
Hurray Tsuge-chan!
You're so cool!

170
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,120
Be careful of the step.

171
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,880
Thanks.

172
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,050
Ouch, that hurt.

173
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,510
Oh no!

174
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,760
What a mess.

175
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,300
Uh oh.

176
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,440
What on earth am I doing here?

177
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,320
There you are.
Haru-sama, Haru-sama.

178
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,210
You cats! One thing after
another all morning.

179
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,460
We're glad you're pleased.

180
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,670
NOT!

181
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,970
Why is that?!

182
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,130
This project has been taken
on by the whole kingdom

183
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,050
to express our maximum gratitude!

184
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,640
What are you saying?

185
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,770
I don't eat mice.

186
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,390
I don't like cattails or catnip.

187
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,190
Oh, is that so...

188
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,360
Excuse our ignorance.

189
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,230
This is unexpected.

190
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,900
How shall I report to the King?

191
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,950
Sorry, did I hurt you?

192
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,320
Maybe I said too much.

193
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,910
To tell the truth, a lot
happened to me recently.

194
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,370
Such as?

195
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,710
Such as many things.

196
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,670
I see, is that so?

197
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,720
Even a beautiful lady like
Haru-sama has troubles.

198
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,430
Again... That's enough.

199
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,100
No, it isn't enough.

200
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,970
We can't stop now.

201
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,730
We'll do our best to
make you satisfied.

202
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,440
You have more?

203
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,650
Yes.

204
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:26,610
Please come visit us in
the Kingdom of Cats.

205
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,150
The Kingdom of Cats?

206
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,700
It's a nice place.

207
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,780
Lots of natural scenery
and good food.

208
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,500
The whole Kingdom will
welcome Haru-sama.

209
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,420
And what's more...

210
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,830
The King is expecting

211
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,380
Prince Lune, who you
saved yesterday,

212
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,840
to welcome Haru-sama
as his bride.

213
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,220
No way! That's impossible.

214
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,350
The Prince is a cat.

215
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,980
What's the problem?

216
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,650
He is a cat, but he's cool!

217
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,650
Cool?

218
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,660
Well...

219
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,580
A kingdom of cats might be good.

220
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,130
Just laying around all day.

221
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,300
Exactly!

222
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,960
It might be heaven.

223
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,260
Eat tons of great food,
then have a nap.

224
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,890
Forget all your troubles...

225
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,390
But a cat's bride...
That's going too far.

226
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,350
Even if he is a prince, that's...

227
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,890
Huh?

228
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,100
Well then, we'll come
for you tonight.

229
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,980
What do you mean?

230
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,820
Hey! Wait!

231
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,780
Ouch.

232
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,990
That really hurts.

233
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,200
Wait, give me time to think.

234
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,040
That is to say... in a word...

235
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,910
What can I do?
I'm sure those cats will do it.

236
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,870
They'll take me to
the Kingdom of Cats.

237
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,000
They'll make me the cat's bride.

238
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,800
No, no. No! Never!

239
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,720
Haru-chan.

240
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,060
Haru-chan.

241
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,060
Who is it?

242
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,230
Haru-chan, the Cat Business Office.

243
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,150
Find the Cat Business Office.

244
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,020
Not this.

245
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,110
Who is this?

246
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,990
What is the Cat Business Office?

247
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,990
I'm sure they'll help you.

248
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,990
A large white cat at the Crossroad
will show you the way.

249
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,330
A large white cat...

250
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,170
Haru-chan, go to the Crossroad

251
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,170
and find the Cat Business Office.

252
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,350
Never heard of
the Cat Business Office.

253
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,530
A large white cat...

254
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,030
But the voice was beautiful.
Might be a nice white cat.

255
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,410
Oh, I'm tired.

256
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,920
I'm taking a break.

257
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,540
What? What is it?

258
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,210
What's this big fat cat?

259
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,510
What are you doing here?

260
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,970
A large white cat!

261
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,010
Is this it?

262
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,180
Hey, you. Do you know
the Cat Business Office?

263
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,940
I need your help.

264
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,860
I mistook you for a different person...
Ehh, a different cat.

265
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,660
I'm sorry I sat on you.

266
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,660
Follow me.

267
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:05,950
You are the one.

268
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,750
Hey, wait for me!

269
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,860
Hey, isn't there an easier way?

270
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,030
Is this revenge?

271
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,160
Because I said you're fat?

272
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,820
What a strange place.

273
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,900
Where's the Cat Business Office?

274
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,280
Are you listening?

275
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,120
I have a big problem.

276
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,710
These cats are taking me
to their kingdom!

277
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,800
Is... this...

278
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,950
Hey, Baron!
You got a visitor!

279
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,090
Cut the theatrics and just come out!

280
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,610
Welcome to the Cat Business Office!

281
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,370
Cool...

282
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,750
This place is in a dimension
a little different from yours,

283
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,660
a world for beings who have souls.

284
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,540
When people create something

285
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,300
with all their heart and hopes,
the creation is given a soul,

286
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,760
like me and him.

287
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,140
Oh my gosh!

288
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,020
He is Toto. A gargoyle with a soul.

289
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,400
Baron, it's quite rare for you
to have a visitor.

290
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,990
Yes, and a quite charming one,
don't you think?

291
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,660
Baron?

292
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,660
I'm Baron Humbert von Gikkingen.

293
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,290
The person who created me named me so.

294
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,290
So that's why you're called Baron.

295
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,500
I heard your story.

296
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,250
Trouble with some cats from
the Cat Kingdom?

297
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,340
That's right.

298
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,010
I saved a cat from being run over.

299
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,890
Now they're saying, in return,
they want to take me to their kingdom.

300
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,800
In return?

301
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,140
Heh, it figures.

302
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,810
Too kind for your own good.

303
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,940
You shouldn't have bothered.

304
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,270
Your mind is nasty as ever.

305
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,940
You can't appreciate the kindness
which saved a cat.

306
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,530
And she is in trouble for it, right?

307
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,620
Never mix in somebody else's business.

308
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,040
Where did you meet this girl?

309
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,500
At the Crossroad place.

310
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,790
She already knew about this place.

311
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,780
Hmm.

312
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,800
Uh, I heard a voice,

313
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,590
though I don't know who it was.

314
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,340
A voice?

315
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,930
You listened to some strange voice?!

316
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,640
How naive can you get... Yeow!

317
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,260
What are you doing?

318
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,300
Why don't you hold your tongue!

319
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,430
You stay out of this!

320
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,270
Don't fight because of me...

321
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,980
You said your name was?

322
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,730
Oh, it's Haru.
My name is Haru.

323
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,030
Okay, Haru.
Please do come in.

324
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,740
Don't worry about them.

325
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,700
You lousy black bird!

326
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,290
Don't you even know I'm a crow?

327
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,500
Come out from the dark, you fowl!

328
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,630
Nobody can miss a giant
marshmallow like you!

329
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,750
You big hog of a cat!

330
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,710
Go get fried, chicken wings!

331
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,090
Shut up, moo shoo pork!

332
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,090
Pollo loco.

333
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,930
I'm coming in.

334
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:35,390
Whoa... This place is gorgeous.

335
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,650
Now, do come in and have a seat.

336
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,440
Thank you.

337
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,070
Any lemon or milk with your tea?

338
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,190
Milk, please.

339
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,580
You have a beautiful office.

340
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,120
Here you are.

341
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,330
Thank you.

342
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,460
Cute.

343
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,090
It's my special blend.

344
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,630
Can't guarantee the flavor though,
it's different each time.

345
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,810
This is good!

346
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,140
This is really good.

347
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,770
Then, you're lucky.

348
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,020
How can you drink green leaves?

349
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,110
Too refined for your
tongue, I bet.

350
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,190
Go catch a worm, bird.

351
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,280
Muta...

352
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,950
Tell me about
the Kingdom of Cats again.

353
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,200
That whole place is fake,
a place for

354
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,750
those who don't have
a mind of their own.

355
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,210
Mind of their own...

356
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,790
One of the Cat King's men said

357
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:43,210
they want me to marry their Prince...

358
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,710
Why not?
A cat's bride?

359
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,920
What?!

360
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,590
Might not be so bad.

361
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,220
This is going nowhere.

362
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,100
Could be an interesting experience.

363
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,430
I see.

364
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,520
I did want to visit
the Kingdom of Cats once.

365
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,270
This might be a good opportunity.

366
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,530
How brave of you, Baron.
But I think I'll give it a miss.

367
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,240
You are coming with me.

368
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,360
No, thanks. It's not my territory.

369
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,370
You're not taking her, are you?

370
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,580
That won't be wise.

371
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,410
But I can't leave her here all alone.

372
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,880
Babysitting isn't my thing either.

373
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,920
Are you busy?

374
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,340
Not really.

375
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,510
Um, I think I'll go home.

376
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,760
I'm just making trouble for all of you.

377
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,770
I started all this mess.

378
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,890
I have to solve this myself.

379
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,810
I see.

380
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,530
I'm sorry
I couldn't be of any help.

381
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,280
Okay. Okay, I'll do it.

382
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,870
I'll just hang around for a while.

383
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,160
You're a good cat, Muta!

384
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,200
It's set then.

385
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,000
Haru, you can come back now.

386
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,250
But...

387
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,130
Muta complains a lot,

388
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,460
but doesn't actually mean it.

389
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,510
I see.

390
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,720
He is actually nice then.

391
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,340
That's right.

392
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,640
I'm not listening.

393
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,640
Thank you for your help.

394
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,600
Buta-san.

395
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,640
Bu? Did you say Bu?!
Note: "Bu" is a reference to his overweight

396
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,150
You said it on purpose, didn't you?!

397
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,940
I'm sorry, it wasn't on purpose!

398
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,860
This girl is not bad.

399
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,570
No way I am going to help!

400
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,860
Didn't we have some delicious
chiffon cake in the cupboard?

401
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,200
Where?

402
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,120
On the upper right shelf.

403
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,580
Why didn't you say so.

404
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,750
Let's have a piece before we start.

405
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,500
I'll go get my special
mulberries then!

406
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,010
It seems like this is
going to be fun.

407
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,930
Let me help too.

408
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,800
Haru, you need to think about

409
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:01,770
how you can learn to be yourself.

410
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:05,150
Then, you should have nothing to fear.

411
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,360
Okay.

412
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:10,320
Baron! Give me a hand. I'm putting
some whipped cream on top.

413
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,820
We're really going full-scale.

414
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,450
Of course we are.

415
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,160
Maybe I'll find something here.

416
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,330
Yes.

417
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,660
Is that Toto-san at the door?

418
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,270
Haru-sama, we have come for you.

419
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,170
No!

420
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,930
What is this?

421
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,970
Not good.

422
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,900
You promised to help me!

423
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:50,520
Baron, horde of cats headed this way.

424
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,530
You're blind as a bat!

425
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,440
After them!

426
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,450
Haru-sama, we looked
all over for you!

427
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,160
I'm going home.

428
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,500
Careful!

429
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,880
Let me off! Take me back!

430
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,210
I am going back, this instant!

431
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:15,470
You must be having
pre-marriage blues.

432
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,840
I am not!

433
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,970
Things got a bit out of hand.

434
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,270
Hey, you, wait, ouch, let go!

435
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,650
Muta-san, and Baron!

436
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,650
Let go, I'm telling you!

437
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,400
Toto, now!

438
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,360
Don't let go!

439
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,030
Why did we get out of the way!

440
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,330
No choice.

441
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,410
I'm really mad now!

442
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,040
Yay!

443
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,790
This is over the weight limit!

444
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,650
Toto!

445
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,800
I see it.

446
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,320
<i>Where are you going?!</i>

447
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,110
Out-maneuvered.

448
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,040
Go up.

449
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,200
OK.

450
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,340
Now what?

451
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,600
The wind. Follow the lights.

452
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,810
OK!

453
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,780
Ouch...

454
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,700
I landed on my back...

455
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,950
Why?

456
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,700
Where am I?

457
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,050
Muta-san? Did you get bigger?

458
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,970
<i>No, you got smaller.</i>

459
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,340
Why?

460
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,810
Because we're here.

461
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,650
This is the Kingdom of Cats?

462
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,260
This is it.

463
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,450
Wow, cats really live here.

464
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,910
Well, this is their kingdom,
you know.

465
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,910
Hey, come on.

466
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,920
Ahh, it's so nice and relaxing here.

467
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,630
We should find a way out
and go back.

468
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,550
Just a little longer.

469
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,760
Let's get going.

470
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,510
But... it feels so nice.

471
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,140
No! You must go back at once.

472
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,560
Hurry. Run away!

473
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,040
Hey, what a pretty cat.

474
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,160
Even the cats are prettier here.

475
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,710
Please, you have
no time to lose!

476
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,840
Haru-chan, you are not meant
to be here.

477
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,300
Why do you know my name?

478
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,840
Haru-sama!

479
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,470
It's that cat again.

480
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,810
I am so relieved to find you.

481
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,890
Seems we dropped you
when coming in.

482
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,940
Your servant exceeded
our weight limit.

483
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,150
Servant?!

484
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,570
No, no. This is Muta-san.

485
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:38,180
Shall we? A banquet is being
prepared in your honor.

486
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,320
You are welcome to join us, Buta-sama.

487
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,330
Bu... Bu?!

488
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,950
But I...

489
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,540
His Majesty is waiting
at the palace.

490
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,330
Palace?

491
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,460
The palace is right over there.

492
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,840
Oh, really.

493
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,920
Yes, indeed.

494
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,340
Hey. You're not thinking of...

495
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,970
Maybe it's rude not to
greet the King first.

496
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,390
Are you out of your mind?

497
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,100
Please, this way.

498
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,310
Wait.

499
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,440
Can she come with us?

500
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,560
What is your name?

501
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,480
My name is Yuki. I serve at
the royal table.

502
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,400
So you work at the palace.

503
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,200
Haru-sama, you'll see her later.

504
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,410
Okay, I'll see you again.

505
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,580
Haru-chan.

506
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,240
What's that? Creepy!

507
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:09,040
There's my future daughter-in-law.

508
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:18,300
Well, I must go see her in person!

509
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,850
He's strangely familiar.

510
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,360
Please change before
meeting the King.

511
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,860
I need to change clothes?

512
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,370
Please wait in the next room.

513
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,910
Why can't I go in with her?

514
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:46,860
Don't be gross.

515
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,620
Gross?

516
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,580
We prepared refreshments for you.

517
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,540
Okay, I'll wait.

518
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,430
Not bad.

519
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,310
The dress is very becoming on you.

520
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:11,100
Prince Lune is the idol of all
female cats in this Kingdom.

521
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,850
You'll be very happy with him.

522
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:14,810
Really?

523
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,440
I mean, no. That's not why I'm here.

524
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,450
You look lovely.

525
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,240
You are the purrfect bride for Lune.

526
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,600
Natoru, who is that cat?

527
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,770
A servant named Buta-sama, I believe.

528
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:51,680
Buta?

529
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,060
Never heard of him.

530
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,570
No match for my stomach.

531
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,700
Um, I am sorry,

532
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,290
but I can't really accept marriage to...

533
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,170
I thought you already said yes?

534
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,790
That was what I was told.

535
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,130
Where is the Prince?

536
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,550
He is away at an official function.

537
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,550
Anyway, I don't really know him.

538
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,810
And the Prince, he is a cat, right?

539
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,390
I'm not a cat, so
I can't marry him.

540
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,980
That, you don't need to
worry about.

541
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,150
You already are a cat.

542
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,670
Wow, real cat ears.

543
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,340
I'm a CAT!

544
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,340
Muta-san!

545
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,060
What happened to him?

546
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,270
He insisted on having
a bowl full

547
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,020
and dunked himself in catnip jelly.

548
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,940
He didn't have to die like this!

549
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,360
Muta-san, how could you
do this to me?

550
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,580
The banquet is ready to begin.

551
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,540
No! I don't want to leave him.

552
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,790
Then, he will come with us.

553
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,090
Is this Haru-sama?

554
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,140
She has a perfect pair of ears!

555
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,180
Such full attractive paws!

556
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,230
I was told you don't like mice,

557
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,780
so I have prepared
fresh fish for you.

558
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,850
Haru doesn't seem pleased.

559
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,050
What do we have
for entertainment?

560
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,490
I will bring them in.

561
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,550
I want something more amusing.

562
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,810
Next!

563
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,550
Can't you do anything better?!

564
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,860
I shall amuse Haru-sama.

565
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,320
What should we do?

566
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,230
Why not?

567
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,170
Shall we dance?

568
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,540
<i>I can't dance meow.</i>

569
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:33,130
Oh no, I even sound like a cat!

570
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,550
Trust me.

571
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,350
They dance well together.

572
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,950
What is this...

573
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,410
I never felt like this before.

574
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,870
Being a cat might
not be that bad.

575
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:50,830
No, Haru. Don't lose yourself.

576
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:55,050
You must learn to be yourself.

577
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,180
I already told you that,
didn't I?

578
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,930
You are...

579
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,480
Stop this music!

580
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,290
You suspicious cat.

581
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:27,700
Exactly who are you?

582
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,170
Apologies for my
belated introduction.

583
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,260
There is nothing to fear.

584
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,680
I am Humbert von Gikkingen.

585
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,230
I have come for Haru.

586
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,350
Baron!

587
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:51,100
Can this be?

588
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,850
What?

589
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,150
No way.

590
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:54,980
Guards, get him!

591
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,370
I can't eat anymore.

592
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,080
It's alive!

593
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,250
I'm glad, you're alive, Muta-san.

594
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,460
Uh oh.

595
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,170
Stop, you scoundrel!

596
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,340
Take His Majesty
to a safe place!

597
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,640
Don't let him get away.

598
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:31,520
Guests' emergency exit this way.

599
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:39,860
Out of my way!

600
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,610
Muta-san. You're strong!

601
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,450
I didn't start it.

602
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:47,330
This way.

603
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,660
You're the cat from before...

604
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,330
Baron, I knew you would come.

605
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,670
How do you know me?

606
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:59,420
I've heard about you
and your Office.

607
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,090
If I had listened to you,

608
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,050
this wouldn't have happened.

609
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:08,510
If you leave before dawn,
you can still become human.

610
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,680
Really?

611
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,140
A secret passage to the outside.

612
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,190
This is convenient.

613
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,920
What about Muta-san?

614
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:26,580
He'll be all right.
Hurry, Haru.

615
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:27,570
Yes.

616
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,040
This is the back of the castle.

617
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,090
The top of that tower leads to the exit.

618
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:45,300
It's so tall!

619
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,010
You must go through the ruins
to the tower and then climb up.

620
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,760
We'll make it.

621
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,560
Good. Please take care of Haru-chan.

622
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,810
Wait.

623
00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:00,320
She is gone. I haven't even
thanked her yet.

624
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,980
Haru, this is just my guess.

625
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:07,030
But isn't she the one
who led you to me?

626
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:10,990
<i>Haru-chan. The Cat Business Office.</i>

627
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,830
Yes, that beautiful voice was hers.

628
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:15,660
But why?

629
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:32,140
Because of you, I almost died.

630
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,770
We must hurry now.

631
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:34,470
Right.

632
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,520
You guys, listen to me.

633
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,190
Did they go in?

634
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

635
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,490
Purrfect.

636
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,530
That labyrinth was built with
our state-of-the-art technology.

637
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,450
We'll enjoy the view from here.

638
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,620
Tricky.

639
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,080
The sun is still high, though.

640
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,700
It's always daytime here.

641
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,500
What? It is?

642
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,760
It's probably past
midnight outside.

643
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,470
Then, we have to hurry!

644
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:12,140
This way? That way?

645
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,970
Which way should we go?

646
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,100
They are lost.

647
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:21,560
It won't be easy to
get out of there.

648
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,480
Right, Your Majesty?

649
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,570
Yes... We have nothing
to worry about.

650
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,150
Where are the soldiers?

651
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,240
Over there.

652
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,820
Let's go this way.

653
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:35,120
We must keep trying,
one by one.

654
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,250
Keep your eyes on the tower.

655
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,750
You won't lose your way.

656
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,170
Smart.

657
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,250
Muta-san, you're cheating.

658
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,250
Why get lost just 'cause
it's a maze.

659
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:47,420
There he is!

660
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,550
Why does it have to be me?

661
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,970
Let's hurry while he keeps
them busy.

662
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:56,600
Right.

663
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,270
Why do I have to be the bait?!

664
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:14,620
Get back, Haru!

665
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,840
You're strong!

666
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,340
Your cane got bent?

667
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,310
I was going to buy
a new one anyway.

668
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,520
Used is best.

669
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,170
Nice shot!

670
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:55,640
It hit one of ours!

671
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,890
What?

672
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:59,190
Your Majesty,
how could you?

673
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,100
Don't tell anyone, okay?

674
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,360
Excuse me, sir.

675
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,280
Our men are all scattered.

676
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,530
They are all lost.

677
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:09,570
Where is Haru-chan?

678
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:13,490
They already got that far!

679
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,490
Hi!

680
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:17,700
Welcome back.

681
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,750
How's that way?

682
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:19,920
It's a dead end.

683
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,480
Everything as planned.

684
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:43,300
Is this another dead end?

685
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,140
It's getting more difficult.

686
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,730
Something's wrong! There was
no wall here a minute ago.

687
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,310
It must be your imagination.

688
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,980
No, we walked through here.

689
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,530
Are you saying that
walls have feet?

690
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:04,240
This is no wall.

691
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,320
It's fake.

692
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:18,210
See?

693
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:19,750
Good work, Haru!

694
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:21,090
What is all this?

695
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:26,720
I told them not to get in line!

696
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:31,930
They are getting away!

697
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,730
Your Majesty, wait!

698
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,570
Go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

699
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:50,870
Show off!

700
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,710
No, Baron...

701
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:54,370
Don't worry!

702
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,140
Your Majesty, please,
it's dangerous.

703
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,560
I can't let this happen!

704
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:22,150
I have soldiers waiting
in the tower, just in case.

705
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,610
Brilliant move!

706
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,000
Good, good.

707
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,300
I'm afraid the tower's
getting old...

708
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,310
This is not good at all!

709
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,430
We have no choice,
but use THAT.

710
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:58,650
What? No, not that!

711
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:01,730
If you do that, Your Majesty,
your image will go to shambles.

712
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:03,020
Give me the button!

713
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,110
There is no such thing here.

714
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,440
Here's the remote control.

715
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,910
Yay, we came out
to an opening.

716
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,200
Just a bit more.

717
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:18,790
Now!

718
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:25,300
What?

719
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,090
Hold on!

720
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:45,150
That was a great spectacle!

721
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:46,990
Let's go!

722
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,880
We're back on the ground.

723
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,660
Let's see how things go.

724
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,370
We have no choice.

725
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,130
Come on, come on.

726
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:09,090
Gikkingen-kun, nice to see you again.

727
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:12,720
Haru-chan! We'll go back to
the castle right away.

728
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,850
Being a cat is not so bad.

729
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:18,560
Do I have to learn to like mice?

730
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,600
It's too early to give up.

731
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:40,750
What's all this?

732
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:42,580
Father!

733
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:47,710
Lune, you're back already?

734
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,970
His Highness the Prince!
As you were!

735
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,720
Prince?

736
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:00,480
I hurried back, thanks to Yuki-chan.

737
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,940
What is all this?

738
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,400
Haru-chan.

739
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:07,110
Oh, we meet again.

740
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:08,860
I'm glad we made it.

741
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,400
Err, I just wanted to thank her.

742
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:15,490
I thought you'd be happy

743
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:18,030
to have Haru-chan as your bride.

744
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:20,330
You don't need to
worry about me.

745
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,370
I want to marry Yuki-chan.

746
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,630
What?!

747
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,460
Looks like news to everyone.

748
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,880
This Prince is not bad.

749
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:36,510
Yuki-chan, look.

750
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,060
I went to your old
home to find this.

751
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:48,440
Oh, could this be
what I think it is?

752
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,190
Those cookies...
I used to love those.

753
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:53,320
That's right.

754
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:57,950
These are the fish cookies you gave
me when I was an orphan kitten.

755
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:00,620
That kitten, that was you!

756
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:04,580
You're so beautiful now that
I didn't recognize you.

757
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,750
Yuki-chan.

758
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:09,290
Will you accept these as a token

759
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,920
of our life together from now on?

760
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,340
That means...

761
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,090
You two are getting married?

762
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:23,180
Oh, I am so happy
for you, Yuki-chan!

763
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:24,900
Thank you, Haru-chan!

764
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:27,810
If I hadn't met you then,

765
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:30,480
I could have starved
on the streets.

766
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,690
You also saved me from danger.

767
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:37,610
I didn't know you were the person
Yuki told me so much about.

768
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:40,080
You saved both of our lives.

769
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,620
How can we thank you?

770
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,580
I don't want anything.

771
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:46,000
You two made me
so happy already.

772
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,710
<i>Saving a cat was a good thing.</i>

773
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,420
This is such a moving sight.

774
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:58,590
So you already had a fianc?©e.

775
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:01,350
I didn't know,
but that is all right.

776
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:04,930
Haru-chan, you must be disappointed.

777
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:05,980
Not really.

778
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,600
No need to be polite.
If you can't marry my son,

779
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,560
why don't you marry me?

780
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:13,650
You can eat all the cookies

781
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,950
and fishes you want.

782
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,530
How about it?

783
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:21,700
Just put me back
to the way I was.

784
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,700
That depends on your answer.

785
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:28,290
Are you out of your mind?!

786
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,800
Of course I don't want
to marry you.

787
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,560
You pervert!

788
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,840
Why can't you?

789
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,350
This is hilarious!

790
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:48,180
It's out of the question!

791
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,900
I admire a woman with
a mind of her own.

792
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,070
You found yourself an ally.

793
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:57,570
I, the great Renaldo Moon, will
lend you a hand!

794
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:58,950
Renaldo?

795
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:00,110
Renaldo Moon?

796
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:01,990
That Renaldo Moon?

797
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,620
That's it!

798
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:04,370
Who?

799
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:05,990
Have you forgotten,
Your Majesty?

800
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:09,750
The worst, most notorious crime
in this Kingdom's history!

801
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,790
A cat suddenly came from nowhere

802
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:14,630
and devoured all the fish
in the lake and escaped.

803
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:17,920
The criminal of the century,
Renaldo Moon!

804
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,010
Unbelievable...

805
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:20,590
He's a monster.

806
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:23,250
Muta, you did this?
Disgraceful.

807
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,910
I'll eat the whole castle this time!

808
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:30,230
Take His Majesty to a safe place!

809
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,900
No!

810
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,030
Men, protect Haru-san.

811
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:39,190
Yes, sir.

812
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:40,610
All forward!

813
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:45,830
Get that culprit!

814
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:46,830
Your Majesty!

815
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,040
Leave my father to me.

816
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,830
Everybody, please run.

817
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:53,710
But the tower has fallen.

818
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:56,000
It's still connected to the other side.

819
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:03,750
Strange...

820
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,470
Oh no, it's dawn.

821
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:06,300
Leave it to me!

822
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,930
What? Are you... doing?!

823
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:10,560
Don't!

824
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,150
Haru, run!
We'll be right behind you!

825
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:16,440
Take care!

826
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:17,900
Yeah.

827
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,860
Thanks, Yuki-chan.

828
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,030
I wasn't wrong.

829
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,040
Saving a cat...

830
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,910
Feeling lost and down...

831
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:35,630
That was all part of
finding out who I am.

832
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,210
You go ahead!

833
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:42,130
Thanks.

834
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,010
Where is Father?

835
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:45,340
Up there.

836
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,930
Father, you'll hurt yourself.
Please come down.

837
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:50,930
What a rash thing to do.

838
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:52,680
I will bring His Majesty back down.

839
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:09,700
We'll settle this with a duel!

840
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,490
My pleasure!

841
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:12,670
Baron!

842
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:13,910
Take care of Haru!

843
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:14,750
Right.

844
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:03,960
I win, King.

845
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,010
Drat!

846
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,810
I've heard about a statue of a cat
that doesn't mind his own business.

847
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:23,070
I had no idea you were this good.

848
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:27,280
I heard you were just a window
display, standing in some back alley.

849
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:32,280
You should have come to
my Kingdom and join me.

850
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,040
Unfortunately, I'm quite happy
with my present way of life.

851
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:45,210
Where am I?!

852
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,470
What did you do?

853
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,550
I didn't do a thing.

854
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,350
With the tower collapsed this much,

855
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,060
I wouldn't be surprised if the exit
moved to a different point.

856
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:00,610
I must go!

857
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:07,570
Haru-sama!

858
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:09,240
I should have foreseen this.

859
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,120
But look! Haru-chan is human again!

860
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,040
I think I'm going to fall.

861
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:24,590
Oh no, I'm falling.

862
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,880
I'm going down!

863
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:30,800
Haru!

864
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:42,100
Muta-san, please don't say I'm heavy.

865
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:46,190
Hang on... but next time...

866
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:50,110
Lose some weight!

867
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,660
I can't hold on!

868
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,160
Haru!

869
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:16,050
I'm going to die!

870
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:18,550
You're not dead yet!
Open your eyes!

871
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:19,470
Baron?

872
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:20,470
Straighten up,

873
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:22,180
and look down!

874
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,120
I can't!

875
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,180
Trust me!

876
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,320
Are we... still alive?

877
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,030
Yes!

878
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:42,280
I think so!

879
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,920
You know what?

880
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,380
We look fantastic!

881
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,430
What is this?

882
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:15,060
There are so many of them.

883
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,110
We're saved.

884
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:24,990
Hey, Muta!

885
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:27,530
How is it, being saved by birds?

886
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:28,540
Toto-san!

887
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,620
Oh, it's lousy black bird.

888
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,290
Thanks for saving us, Toto.

889
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:35,830
Glad I had my friends
waiting up here.

890
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:38,590
Doesn't it hurt walking on them?

891
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,760
You're light as a feather, Haru.

892
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,630
Really?

893
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,110
I disagree.

894
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:44,470
Look, Haru!

895
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:47,430
It's my school!

896
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,180
I'm home. I was able to
come back!

897
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,430
Everybody, thank you so much!

898
01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:00,480
Yes! They made it!

899
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,940
Hooray, Haru-sama!

900
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,030
I'm relieved.

901
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,070
Take care, Haru-chan!

902
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:08,740
Your Majesty!

903
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,330
Natori.

904
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:19,630
My time on the throne is over.

905
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:22,420
Then I must resign with you.

906
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:33,600
Toto-san, thank you.

907
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:38,770
My heart is still pounding.

908
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:40,060
Of course.

909
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,190
But it was a bit fun.

910
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:43,610
Yeah, right.

911
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:47,450
Haru has to go to school,

912
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:51,030
so she'd better go home and rest.

913
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:52,620
Yeah.

914
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:55,370
Is this going to be goodbye?

915
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:57,290
Must do one last thing.

916
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:14,810
Baron, I might have
a crush on you.

917
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:19,650
I admire your sincerity, Haru.

918
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:27,820
Haru, when you really need us,

919
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:31,240
our doors will open to you again.

920
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:35,160
Until then, goodbye!

921
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:42,000
Goodbye.

922
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:53,010
Thank you!

923
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:57,230
Baron! Toto-san!
You too, Muta-san!

924
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:02,110
What do you mean, me too?

925
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:05,650
Me too?

926
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:40,100
Oh no, better get up.

927
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:49,530
Morning.

928
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:52,330
Why are you up so early?

929
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:54,570
Today is Sunday.

930
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:55,870
I'm going to the movies
with Hiromi.

931
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:57,490
Going early before
it gets crowded.

932
01:09:59,080 --> 01:09:59,950
I better get going.

933
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,790
I made eggs and salad for you.

934
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:04,460
What?

935
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,130
I already ate, so please
help yourself.

936
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:07,750
There is also English tea
in the pot.

937
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:10,880
And about the tea...

938
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:14,300
That's Haru-chan's special blend.

939
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:18,310
It's a bit different each time,
so no guarantees about the flavor.

940

01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:28,230
Hey, smells good.

942
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:34,160
Haru! News from a reliable source!

943
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,990
What's the big fuss about?

944
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:38,490
Machida, he broke up!

945
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,500
Oh, he did, huh?

946
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,710
What kind of reaction is that?

947
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:48,800
What?

948
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,880
Don't you have more
to say than that?

949
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,260
No.

950
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,090

956
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:10,780
No, honestly.

958
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,570

959
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:14,530
What?

960
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:18,120
I'll stretch my hands to it once more

961

962

Err, no. Nothing at all.
