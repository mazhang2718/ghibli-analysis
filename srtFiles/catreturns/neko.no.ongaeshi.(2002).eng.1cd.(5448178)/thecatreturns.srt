by something mysterious...

Oh no!

Really...

13
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,460

Oh, so delicious.

17
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,930
Not fair.

18
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,390
Bye.

19
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,580

Late again and embarrassed

<i>He was laughing.</i>

35
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,700
Why?

36
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,910
What's wrong with me?

37
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,290
Well, this must be a sign.

Thanks for the sympathy.

40
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,970
That's an unusual cat.

41
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,980
What's so great about Machida?

42
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,230
He's just so cool!

43

Have you told him that?

44
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,060
He seems to have a girlfriend.

45

She's a freshman and
very good-looking.

46

Good, if he dumps you...

51
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,550
Had something in his mouth.

52
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,500
Stolen goods?

53
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,420
Who knows...

54
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,430

56
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,270
Anyway. It's just a cat.

58

Wait, Haru!

60
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,090

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,480
Are you OK?

64
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,000
Thank you for saving me
from a dangerous situation.

65
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,500
I hope you haven't injured yourself.

66
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,630
Please excuse me,
but I really must be going now.

67
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,640
Allow me to express
my gratitude later.

68
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Don't mention it.

69
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,560
Haru!

70
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,320
Ah, you broke it.

71
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,360
Never mind, a cat's life is
more important.

72
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,610
Did you see that?

73
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,300
Huh?

74
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,200
The cat bowed to me.

75
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,700
Haru... Did you hit your head?

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,460
I'm home.

77
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,590
Don't step on that!

78
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,800
Sorry. I can't decide
which pattern to use.

79
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,260
Honey, can you make dinner?

80
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,180
Mom.

81
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,190
Can cats talk?

82
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,940
Well... Let's see.

83
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,150
What?!

84
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,030
Come to think of it,
you said so before.

85
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,990
Really?

86
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,700
When you were very small,

87
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,000
you used to say
"I can talk with cats."

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,370
Did I?

89
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,330
Yes, don't you remember?

90
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,230
What's wrong?

91
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,950
I see, you're hungry.

92
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,450
Do you like fish?

93
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,580
OK, take these.

94
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,000
You're so dirty...

95
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,580
Good?

96
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,170
OK, OK.

97
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,840
More?

98
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,840
Good girl.

99
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,090
Eat them all.

100
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,060
No need to thank me.

101
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,020
Haru.

102
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,900
Oh, Mom!

103
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,480
What were you doing?

104
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,570
Talking with a cat.

105
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,110
Remember I asked you what did you
talk about with the cat?

106
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,660
Then you said, "She told me it's
tough to make a living in this world."

107
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,660
and I thought it was so funny.

108
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,840
I guess that did happen.

109
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,340
Anyway, I'll get up
early tomorrow

110
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,760
in time for breakfast.

111
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,340
Uhm... Over here please.

112
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,220
A little closer.

113
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,150
Allow me to introduce.

114
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,530
The King of the Kingdom of Cats.

115
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,570
A King among Kings.

116
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,030
The Cat King.

117
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,450
That's me.

118
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,370
The cat you saved today was

119
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,710
the son of the King, Prince Lune.

120
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,510
Given the importance
of the matter,

121
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,720
the King himself has come to
show his gratitude.

122
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,270
Uh... Mhh...

123
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,930
Thank you.

124
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,650
This is the program.

125
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,280
From tomorrow,

126
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,080
countless joys will befall you.

127
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,960
Thank you.

128
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,460
See you.

129
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,700
A dream?

130
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,500
You're saying...

131
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,340
It really wasn't you
who did this?

132
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,210
I have no idea.

133
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,470
Then who did it?

134
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,680
Haru!

135
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,350
Haru, hurry up!

136
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,480
<i>What is this?!</i>

137
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,070
Cattails!

138
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,400
Oh, I work too hard.
I'll be in bed today.

139
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,540
No!

140
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,210
Why?

141
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,840
Haru, it's this one, see?

142
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,800
Morning!
Sorry. Got to run.

143
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,350
What's she up to?

144
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,230
You think she has catnip?

145
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,100
Catnip? Why?

146
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,020
Don't know.

147
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,320
Hey, Yoshioka!
Leave your cats at home.

148
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,530
They're not mine.

149
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,530
What is this?

150
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,330
It wasn't a dream.

151
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,290
<i>It was those cats that did this.</i>

152
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,250
Was it a mistake to save a cat?

153
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:20,760
Haru.

154
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,180
Wha... What is it?

155
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,430
Did you get rid of
the catnip smell?

156
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,560
Yeah. It seems OK

157
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,390
and the cats aren't after me
anymore.

158
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,890
That's good.

159
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,440
Yeah.

160
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,520
Say, can I ask you a favor?

161
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,360
Can you take my turn
for clean-up?

162
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,650
Tsuge-chan has a game today

163
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,320
and I can't make it if I don't
leave right now.

164
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,450
Please!

165
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,200
Oh... Sure...

166
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,620
Clean-up, right?

167
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,170
Thank you, Haru!

168
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,170
Tsuge-chan! Go for it!

169
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,140
Hurray Tsuge-chan!
You're so cool!

170
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,120
Be careful of the step.

171
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
Thanks.

172
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,050
Ouch, that hurt.

173
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,510
Oh no!

174
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,760
What a mess.

175
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,300
Uh oh.

176
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,440
What on earth am I doing here?

177
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,320
There you are.
Haru-sama, Haru-sama.

178
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,210
You cats! One thing after
another all morning.

179
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,460
We're glad you're pleased.

180
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,670
NOT!

181
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,970
Why is that?!

182
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,130
This project has been taken
on by the whole kingdom

183
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,050
to express our maximum gratitude!

184
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,640
What are you saying?

185
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,770
I don't eat mice.

186
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,390
I don't like cattails or catnip.

187
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,190
Oh, is that so...

188
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,360
Excuse our ignorance.

189
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,230
This is unexpected.

190
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,900
How shall I report to the King?

191
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,950
Sorry, did I hurt you?

192
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,320
Maybe I said too much.

193
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,910
To tell the truth, a lot
happened to me recently.

194
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,370
Such as?

195
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,710
Such as many things.

196
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,670
I see, is that so?

197
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,720
Even a beautiful lady like
Haru-sama has troubles.

198
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,430
Again... That's enough.

199
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,100
No, it isn't enough.

200
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,970
We can't stop now.

201
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,730
We'll do our best to
make you satisfied.

202
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,440
You have more?

203
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,650
Yes.

204
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,610
Please come visit us in
the Kingdom of Cats.

205
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,150
The Kingdom of Cats?

206
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,700
It's a nice place.

207
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,780
Lots of natural scenery
and good food.

208
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,500
The whole Kingdom will
welcome Haru-sama.

209
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,420
And what's more...

210
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,830
The King is expecting

211
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,380
Prince Lune, who you
saved yesterday,

212
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,840
to welcome Haru-sama
as his bride.

213
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,220
No way! That's impossible.

214
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,350
The Prince is a cat.

215
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,980
What's the problem?

216
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,650
He is a cat, but he's cool!

217
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,650
Cool?

218
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,660
Well...

219
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,580
A kingdom of cats might be good.

220
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,130
Just laying around all day.

221
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,300
Exactly!

222
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,960
It might be heaven.

223
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,260
Eat tons of great food,
then have a nap.

224
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,890
Forget all your troubles...

225
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,390
But a cat's bride...
That's going too far.

226
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,350
Even if he is a prince, that's...

227
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:38,890
Huh?

228
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,100
Well then, we'll come
for you tonight.

229
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,980
What do you mean?

230
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,820
Hey! Wait!

231
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,780
Ouch.

232
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,990
That really hurts.

233
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,200
Wait, give me time to think.

234
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,040
That is to say... in a word...

235
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,910
What can I do?
I'm sure those cats will do it.

236
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,870
They'll take me to
the Kingdom of Cats.

237
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,000
They'll make me the cat's bride.

238
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,800
No, no. No! Never!

239
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,720
Haru-chan.

240
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,060
Haru-chan.

241
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,060
Who is it?

242
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,230
Haru-chan, the Cat Business Office.

243
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,150
Find the Cat Business Office.

244
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,020
Not this.

245
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,110
Who is this?

246
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,990
What is the Cat Business Office?

247
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,990
I'm sure they'll help you.

248
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,990
A large white cat at the Crossroad
will show you the way.

249
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,330
A large white cat...

250
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,170
Haru-chan, go to the Crossroad

251
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,170
and find the Cat Business Office.

252
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,350
Never heard of
the Cat Business Office.

253
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,530
A large white cat...

254
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,030
But the voice was beautiful.
Might be a nice white cat.

255
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,410
Oh, I'm tired.

256
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,920
I'm taking a break.

257
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,540
What? What is it?

258
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,210
What's this big fat cat?

259
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,510
What are you doing here?

260
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,970
A large white cat!

261
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,010
Is this it?

262
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,180
Hey, you. Do you know
the Cat Business Office?

263
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,940
I need your help.

264
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,860
I mistook you for a different person...
Ehh, a different cat.

265
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,660
I'm sorry I sat on you.

266
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,660
Follow me.

267
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:04,950
You are the one.

268
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,750
Hey, wait for me!

269
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,860
Hey, isn't there an easier way?

270
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,030
Is this revenge?

271
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,160
Because I said you're fat?

272
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,820
What a strange place.

273
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,900
Where's the Cat Business Office?

274
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,280
Are you listening?

275
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,120
I have a big problem.

276
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,710
These cats are taking me
to their kingdom!

277
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,800
Is... this...

278
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,950
Hey, Baron!
You got a visitor!

279
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,090
Cut the theatrics and just come out!

280
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,610
Welcome to the Cat Business Office!

281
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,370
Cool...

282
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:05,750
This place is in a dimension
a little different from yours,

283
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,660
a world for beings who have souls.

284
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,540
When people create something

285
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,300
with all their heart and hopes,
the creation is given a soul,

286
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,760
like me and him.

287
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,140
Oh my gosh!

288
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,020
He is Toto. A gargoyle with a soul.

289
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,400
Baron, it's quite rare for you
to have a visitor.

290
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,990
Yes, and a quite charming one,
don't you think?

291
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,660
Baron?

292
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,660
I'm Baron Humbert von Gikkingen.

293
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,290
The person who created me named me so.

294
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,290
So that's why you're called Baron.

295
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,500
I heard your story.

296
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,250
Trouble with some cats from
the Cat Kingdom?

297
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,340
That's right.

298
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,010
I saved a cat from being run over.

299
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,890
Now they're saying, in return,
they want to take me to their kingdom.

300
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,800
In return?

301
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,140
Heh, it figures.

302
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,810
Too kind for your own good.

303
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,940
You shouldn't have bothered.

304
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,270
Your mind is nasty as ever.

305
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,940
You can't appreciate the kindness
which saved a cat.

306
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,530
And she is in trouble for it, right?

307
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,620
Never mix in somebody else's business.

308
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,040
Where did you meet this girl?

309
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,500
At the Crossroad place.

310
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,790
She already knew about this place.

311
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,780
Hmm.

312
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,800
Uh, I heard a voice,

313
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,590
though I don't know who it was.

314
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,340
A voice?

315
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,930
You listened to some strange voice?!

316
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,640
How naive can you get... Yeow!

317
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,260
What are you doing?

318
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,300
Why don't you hold your tongue!

319
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,430
You stay out of this!

320
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,270
Don't fight because of me...

321
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,980
You said your name was?

322
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,730
Oh, it's Haru.
My name is Haru.

323
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,030
Okay, Haru.
Please do come in.

324
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,740
Don't worry about them.

325
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,700
You lousy black bird!

326
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,290
Don't you even know I'm a crow?

327
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,500
Come out from the dark, you fowl!

328
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,630
Nobody can miss a giant
marshmallow like you!

329
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,750
You big hog of a cat!

330
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,710
Go get fried, chicken wings!

331
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,090
Shut up, moo shoo pork!

332
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,090
Pollo loco.

333
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,930
I'm coming in.

334
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,390
Whoa... This place is gorgeous.

335
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,650
Now, do come in and have a seat.

336
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,440
Thank you.

337
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,070
Any lemon or milk with your tea?

338
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,190
Milk, please.

339
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,580
You have a beautiful office.

340
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,120
Here you are.

341
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,330
Thank you.

342
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,460
Cute.

343
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,090
It's my special blend.

344
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,630
Can't guarantee the flavor though,
it's different each time.

345
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,810
This is good!

346
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,140
This is really good.

347
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,770
Then, you're lucky.

348
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,020
How can you drink green leaves?

349
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,110
Too refined for your
tongue, I bet.

350
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,190
Go catch a worm, bird.

351
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,280
Muta...

352
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:28,950
Tell me about
the Kingdom of Cats again.

353
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,200
That whole place is fake,
a place for

354
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,750
those who don't have
a mind of their own.

355
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,210
Mind of their own...

356
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,790
One of the Cat King's men said

357
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:42,210
they want me to marry their Prince...

358
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,710
Why not?
A cat's bride?

359
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,920
What?!

360
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,590
Might not be so bad.

361
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,220
This is going nowhere.

362
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,100
Could be an interesting experience.

363
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,430
I see.

364
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,520
I did want to visit
the Kingdom of Cats once.

365
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,270
This might be a good opportunity.

366
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,530
How brave of you, Baron.
But I think I'll give it a miss.

367
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,240
You are coming with me.

368
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,360
No, thanks. It's not my territory.

369
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,370
You're not taking her, are you?

370
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,580
That won't be wise.

371
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,410
But I can't leave her here all alone.

372
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,880
Babysitting isn't my thing either.

373
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,920
Are you busy?

374
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,340
Not really.

375
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,510
Um, I think I'll go home.

376
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,760
I'm just making trouble for all of you.

377
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,770
I started all this mess.

378
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,890
I have to solve this myself.

379
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,810
I see.

380
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,530
I'm sorry
I couldn't be of any help.

381
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,280
Okay. Okay, I'll do it.

382
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,870
I'll just hang around for a while.

383
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,160
You're a good cat, Muta!

384
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,200
It's set then.

385
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,000
Haru, you can come back now.

386
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,250
But...

387
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,130
Muta complains a lot,

388
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,460
but doesn't actually mean it.

389
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,510
I see.

390
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,720
He is actually nice then.

391
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,340
That's right.

392
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,640
I'm not listening.

393
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,640
Thank you for your help.

394
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,600
Buta-san.

395
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,640
Bu? Did you say Bu?!
Note: "Bu" is a reference to his overweight

396
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,150
You said it on purpose, didn't you?!

397
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,940
I'm sorry, it wasn't on purpose!

398
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,860
This girl is not bad.

399
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,570
No way I am going to help!

400
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,860
Didn't we have some delicious
chiffon cake in the cupboard?

401
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,200
Where?

402
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,120
On the upper right shelf.

403
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,580
Why didn't you say so.

404
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,750
Let's have a piece before we start.

405
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,500
I'll go get my special
mulberries then!

406
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,010
It seems like this is
going to be fun.

407
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,930
Let me help too.

408
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,800
Haru, you need to think about

409
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:00,770
how you can learn to be yourself.

410
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,150
Then, you should have nothing to fear.

411
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,360
Okay.

412
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:09,320
Baron! Give me a hand. I'm putting
some whipped cream on top.

413
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,820
We're really going full-scale.

414
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,450
Of course we are.

415
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,160
Maybe I'll find something here.

416
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,330
Yes.

417
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,660
Is that Toto-san at the door?

418
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,270
Haru-sama, we have come for you.

419
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,170
No!

420
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,930
What is this?

421
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:39,970
Not good.

422
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,900
You promised to help me!

423
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,520
Baron, horde of cats headed this way.

424
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,530
You're blind as a bat!

425
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,440
After them!

426
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,450
Haru-sama, we looked
all over for you!

427
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,160
I'm going home.

428
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,500
Careful!

429
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,880
Let me off! Take me back!

430
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,210
I am going back, this instant!

431
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,470
You must be having
pre-marriage blues.

432
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,840
I am not!

433
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,970
Things got a bit out of hand.

434
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,270
Hey, you, wait, ouch, let go!

435
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,650
Muta-san, and Baron!

436
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,650
Let go, I'm telling you!

437
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,400
Toto, now!

438
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,360
Don't let go!

439
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,030
Why did we get out of the way!

440
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,330
No choice.

441
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,410
I'm really mad now!

442
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,040
Yay!

443
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,790
This is over the weight limit!

444
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,650
Toto!

445
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,800
I see it.

446
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,320
<i>Where are you going?!</i>

447
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,110
Out-maneuvered.

448
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,040
Go up.

449
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,200
OK.

450
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,340
Now what?

451
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,600
The wind. Follow the lights.

452
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,810
OK!

453
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,780
Ouch...

454
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,700
I landed on my back...

455
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,950
Why?

456
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,700
Where am I?

457
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,050
Muta-san? Did you get bigger?

458
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,970
<i>No, you got smaller.</i>

459
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,340
Why?

460
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,810
Because we're here.

461
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,650
This is the Kingdom of Cats?

462
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,260
This is it.

463
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,450
Wow, cats really live here.

464
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,910
Well, this is their kingdom,
you know.

465
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,910
Hey, come on.

466
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,920
Ahh, it's so nice and relaxing here.

467
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,630
We should find a way out
and go back.

468
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,550
Just a little longer.

469
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,760
Let's get going.

470
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,510
But... it feels so nice.

471
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,140
No! You must go back at once.

472
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,560
Hurry. Run away!

473
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,040
Hey, what a pretty cat.

474
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,160
Even the cats are prettier here.

475
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,710
Please, you have
no time to lose!

476
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,840
Haru-chan, you are not meant
to be here.

477
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,300
Why do you know my name?

478
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,840
Haru-sama!

479
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,470
It's that cat again.

480
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,810
I am so relieved to find you.

481
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,890
Seems we dropped you
when coming in.

482
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,940
Your servant exceeded
our weight limit.

483
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,150
Servant?!

484
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,570
No, no. This is Muta-san.

485
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:37,180
Shall we? A banquet is being
prepared in your honor.

486
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,320
You are welcome to join us, Buta-sama.

487
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,330
Bu... Bu?!

488
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,950
But I...

489
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,540
His Majesty is waiting
at the palace.

490
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,330
Palace?

491
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,460
The palace is right over there.

492
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,840
Oh, really.

493
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,920
Yes, indeed.

494
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,340
Hey. You're not thinking of...

495
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,970
Maybe it's rude not to
greet the King first.

496
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,390
Are you out of your mind?

497
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,100
Please, this way.

498
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,310
Wait.

499
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,440
Can she come with us?

500
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,560
What is your name?

501
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,480
My name is Yuki. I serve at
the royal table.

502
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,400
So you work at the palace.

503
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,200
Haru-sama, you'll see her later.

504
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,410
Okay, I'll see you again.

505
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,580
Haru-chan.

506
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,240
What's that? Creepy!

507
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:08,040
There's my future daughter-in-law.

508
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,300
Well, I must go see her in person!

509
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,850
He's strangely familiar.

510
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,360
Please change before
meeting the King.

511
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,860
I need to change clothes?

512
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,370
Please wait in the next room.

513
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,910
Why can't I go in with her?

514
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,860
Don't be gross.

515
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,620
Gross?

516
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,580
We prepared refreshments for you.

517
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,540
Okay, I'll wait.

518
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,430
Not bad.

519
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,310
The dress is very becoming on you.

520
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,100
Prince Lune is the idol of all
female cats in this Kingdom.

521
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,850
You'll be very happy with him.

522
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,810
Really?

523
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:17,440
I mean, no. That's not why I'm here.

524
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,450
You look lovely.

525
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:25,240
You are the purrfect bride for Lune.

526
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,600
Natoru, who is that cat?

527
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,770
A servant named Buta-sama, I believe.

528
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:50,680
Buta?

529
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,060
Never heard of him.

530
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,570
No match for my stomach.

531
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,700
Um, I am sorry,

532
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,290
but I can't really accept marriage to...

533
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,170
I thought you already said yes?

534
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,790
That was what I was told.

535
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,130
Where is the Prince?

536
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,550
He is away at an official function.

537
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,550
Anyway, I don't really know him.

538
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,810
And the Prince, he is a cat, right?

539
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,390
I'm not a cat, so
I can't marry him.

540
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,980
That, you don't need to
worry about.

541
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,150
You already are a cat.

542
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,670
Wow, real cat ears.

543
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,340
I'm a CAT!

544
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,340
Muta-san!

545
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,060
What happened to him?

546
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,270
He insisted on having
a bowl full

547
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,020
and dunked himself in catnip jelly.

548
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,940
He didn't have to die like this!

549
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,360
Muta-san, how could you
do this to me?

550
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,580
The banquet is ready to begin.

551
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,540
No! I don't want to leave him.

552
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,790
Then, he will come with us.

553
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,090
Is this Haru-sama?

554
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,140
She has a perfect pair of ears!

555
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,180
Such full attractive paws!

556
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,230
I was told you don't like mice,

557
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,780
so I have prepared
fresh fish for you.

558
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,850
Haru doesn't seem pleased.

559
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,050
What do we have
for entertainment?

560
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,490
I will bring them in.

561
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,550
I want something more amusing.

562
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,810
Next!

563
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:49,550
Can't you do anything better?!

564
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,860
I shall amuse Haru-sama.

565
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,320
What should we do?

566
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,230
Why not?

567
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,170
Shall we dance?

568
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,540
<i>I can't dance meow.</i>

569
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:32,130
Oh no, I even sound like a cat!

570
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,550
Trust me.

571
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,350
They dance well together.

572
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,950
What is this...

573
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,410
I never felt like this before.

574
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,870
Being a cat might
not be that bad.

575
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:49,830
No, Haru. Don't lose yourself.

576
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,050
You must learn to be yourself.

577
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,180
I already told you that,
didn't I?

578
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,930
You are...

579
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,480
Stop this music!

580
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,290
You suspicious cat.

581
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,700
Exactly who are you?

582
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,170
Apologies for my
belated introduction.

583
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,260
There is nothing to fear.

584
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,680
I am Humbert von Gikkingen.

585
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,230
I have come for Haru.

586
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,350
Baron!

587
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,100
Can this be?

588
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,850
What?

589
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,150
No way.

590
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:53,980
Guards, get him!

591
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,370
I can't eat anymore.

592
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,080
It's alive!

593
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,250
I'm glad, you're alive, Muta-san.

594
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,460
Uh oh.

595
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,170
Stop, you scoundrel!

596
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,340
Take His Majesty
to a safe place!

597
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,640
Don't let him get away.

598
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,520
Guests' emergency exit this way.

599
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,860
Out of my way!

600
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,610
Muta-san. You're strong!

601
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,450
I didn't start it.

602
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,330
This way.

603
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,660
You're the cat from before...

604
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,330
Baron, I knew you would come.

605
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,670
How do you know me?

606
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,420
I've heard about you
and your Office.

607
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,090
If I had listened to you,

608
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:03,050
this wouldn't have happened.

609
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:07,510
If you leave before dawn,
you can still become human.

610
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,680
Really?

611
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,140
A secret passage to the outside.

612
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,190
This is convenient.

613
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,920
What about Muta-san?

614
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,580
He'll be all right.
Hurry, Haru.

615
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:26,570
Yes.

616
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,040
This is the back of the castle.

617
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,090
The top of that tower leads to the exit.

618
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:44,300
It's so tall!

619
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:48,010
You must go through the ruins
to the tower and then climb up.

620
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:49,760
We'll make it.

621
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:53,560
Good. Please take care of Haru-chan.

622
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,810
Wait.

623
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:59,320
She is gone. I haven't even
thanked her yet.

624
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,980
Haru, this is just my guess.

625
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,030
But isn't she the one
who led you to me?

626
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,990
<i>Haru-chan. The Cat Business Office.</i>

627
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:13,830
Yes, that beautiful voice was hers.

628
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:14,660
But why?

629
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,140
Because of you, I almost died.

630
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,770
We must hurry now.

631
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:33,470
Right.

632
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,520
You guys, listen to me.

633
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:44,190
Did they go in?

634
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

635
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,490
Purrfect.

636
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,530
That labyrinth was built with
our state-of-the-art technology.

637
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,450
We'll enjoy the view from here.

638
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,620
Tricky.

639
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,080
The sun is still high, though.

640
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,700
It's always daytime here.

641
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,500
What? It is?

642
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,760
It's probably past
midnight outside.

643
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,470
Then, we have to hurry!

644
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,140
This way? That way?

645
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,970
Which way should we go?

646
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,100
They are lost.

647
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:20,560
It won't be easy to
get out of there.

648
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,480
Right, Your Majesty?

649
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,570
Yes... We have nothing
to worry about.

650
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,150
Where are the soldiers?

651
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:27,240
Over there.

652
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,820
Let's go this way.

653
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,120
We must keep trying,
one by one.

654
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,250
Keep your eyes on the tower.

655
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,750
You won't lose your way.

656
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,170
Smart.

657
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,250
Muta-san, you're cheating.

658
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,250
Why get lost just 'cause
it's a maze.

659
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:46,420
There he is!

660
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,550
Why does it have to be me?

661
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,970
Let's hurry while he keeps
them busy.

662
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:55,600
Right.

663
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,270
Why do I have to be the bait?!

664
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:13,620
Get back, Haru!

665
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,840
You're strong!

666
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,340
Your cane got bent?

667
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,310
I was going to buy
a new one anyway.

668
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,520
Used is best.

669
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,170
Nice shot!

670
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:54,640
It hit one of ours!

671
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,890
What?

672
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:58,190
Your Majesty,
how could you?

673
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,100
Don't tell anyone, okay?

674
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,360
Excuse me, sir.

675
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,280
Our men are all scattered.

676
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,530
They are all lost.

677
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:08,570
Where is Haru-chan?

678
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:12,490
They already got that far!

679
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,490
Hi!

680
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:16,700
Welcome back.

681
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,750
How's that way?

682
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:18,920
It's a dead end.

683
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:38,480
Everything as planned.

684
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,300
Is this another dead end?

685
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,140
It's getting more difficult.

686
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,730
Something's wrong! There was
no wall here a minute ago.

687
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,310
It must be your imagination.

688
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,980
No, we walked through here.

689
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,530
Are you saying that
walls have feet?

690
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,240
This is no wall.

691
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,320
It's fake.

692
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:17,210
See?

693
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,750
Good work, Haru!

694
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,090
What is all this?

695
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:25,720
I told them not to get in line!

696
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:30,930
They are getting away!

697
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,730
Your Majesty, wait!

698
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,570
Go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

699
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:49,870
Show off!

700
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:52,710
No, Baron...

701
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:53,370
Don't worry!

702
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,140
Your Majesty, please,
it's dangerous.

703
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,560
I can't let this happen!

704
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:21,150
I have soldiers waiting
in the tower, just in case.

705
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:25,610
Brilliant move!

706
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,000
Good, good.

707
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:49,300
I'm afraid the tower's
getting old...

708
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,310
This is not good at all!

709
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:55,430
We have no choice,
but use THAT.

710
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:57,650
What? No, not that!

711
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,730
If you do that, Your Majesty,
your image will go to shambles.

712
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,020
Give me the button!

713
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,110
There is no such thing here.

714
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:05,440
Here's the remote control.

715
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,910
Yay, we came out
to an opening.

716
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,200
Just a bit more.

717
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:17,790
Now!

718
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:24,300
What?

719
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,090
Hold on!

720
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,150
That was a great spectacle!

721
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,990
Let's go!

722
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:52,880
We're back on the ground.

723
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,660
Let's see how things go.

724
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,370
We have no choice.

725
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,130
Come on, come on.

726
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:08,090
Gikkingen-kun, nice to see you again.

727
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:11,720
Haru-chan! We'll go back to
the castle right away.

728
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,850
Being a cat is not so bad.

729
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:17,560
Do I have to learn to like mice?

730
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,600
It's too early to give up.

731
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,750
What's all this?

732
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:41,580
Father!

733
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:46,710
Lune, you're back already?

734
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,970
His Highness the Prince!
As you were!

735
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,720
Prince?

736
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:59,480
I hurried back, thanks to Yuki-chan.

737
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,940
What is all this?

738
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,400
Haru-chan.

739
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:06,110
Oh, we meet again.

740
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,860
I'm glad we made it.

741
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,400
Err, I just wanted to thank her.

742
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:14,490
I thought you'd be happy

743
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:17,030
to have Haru-chan as your bride.

744
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:19,330
You don't need to
worry about me.

745
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:21,370
I want to marry Yuki-chan.

746
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,630
What?!

747
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,460
Looks like news to everyone.

748
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,880
This Prince is not bad.

749
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,510
Yuki-chan, look.

750
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,060
I went to your old
home to find this.

751
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:47,440
Oh, could this be
what I think it is?

752
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,190
Those cookies...
I used to love those.

753
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:52,320
That's right.

754
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:56,950
These are the fish cookies you gave
me when I was an orphan kitten.

755
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:59,620
That kitten, that was you!

756
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:03,580
You're so beautiful now that
I didn't recognize you.

757
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,750
Yuki-chan.

758
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:08,290
Will you accept these as a token

759
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,920
of our life together from now on?

760
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,340
That means...

761
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,090
You two are getting married?

762
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:22,180
Oh, I am so happy
for you, Yuki-chan!

763
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,900
Thank you, Haru-chan!

764
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:26,810
If I hadn't met you then,

765
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:29,480
I could have starved
on the streets.

766
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,690
You also saved me from danger.

767
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:36,610
I didn't know you were the person
Yuki told me so much about.

768
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:39,080
You saved both of our lives.

769
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,620
How can we thank you?

770
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:42,580
I don't want anything.

771
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,000
You two made me
so happy already.

772
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,710
<i>Saving a cat was a good thing.</i>

773
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,420
This is such a moving sight.

774
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,590
So you already had a fianc?©e.

775
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:00,350
I didn't know,
but that is all right.

776
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:03,930
Haru-chan, you must be disappointed.

777
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:04,980
Not really.

778
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,600
No need to be polite.
If you can't marry my son,

779
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,560
why don't you marry me?

780
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:12,650
You can eat all the cookies

781
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,950
and fishes you want.

782
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,530
How about it?

783
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:20,700
Just put me back
to the way I was.

784
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,700
That depends on your answer.

785
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,290
Are you out of your mind?!

786
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,800
Of course I don't want
to marry you.

787
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,560
You pervert!

788
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:38,840
Why can't you?

789
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:44,350
This is hilarious!

790
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:47,180
It's out of the question!

791
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,900
I admire a woman with
a mind of her own.

792
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:54,070
You found yourself an ally.

793
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:56,570
I, the great Renaldo Moon, will
lend you a hand!

794
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:57,950
Renaldo?

795
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,110
Renaldo Moon?

796
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:00,990
That Renaldo Moon?

797
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:02,620
That's it!

798
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,370
Who?

799
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:04,990
Have you forgotten,
Your Majesty?

800
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:08,750
The worst, most notorious crime
in this Kingdom's history!

801
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,790
A cat suddenly came from nowhere

802
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:13,630
and devoured all the fish
in the lake and escaped.

803
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:16,920
The criminal of the century,
Renaldo Moon!

804
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,010
Unbelievable...

805
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:19,590
He's a monster.

806
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:22,250
Muta, you did this?
Disgraceful.

807
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,910
I'll eat the whole castle this time!

808
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:29,230
Take His Majesty to a safe place!

809
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,900
No!

810
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:37,030
Men, protect Haru-san.

811
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,190
Yes, sir.

812
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:39,610
All forward!

813
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:44,830
Get that culprit!

814
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,830
Your Majesty!

815
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,040
Leave my father to me.

816
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,830
Everybody, please run.

817
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:52,710
But the tower has fallen.

818
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:55,000
It's still connected to the other side.

819
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:02,750
Strange...

820
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,470
Oh no, it's dawn.

821
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:05,300
Leave it to me!

822
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,930
What? Are you... doing?!

823
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:09,560
Don't!

824
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,150
Haru, run!
We'll be right behind you!

825
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:15,440
Take care!

826
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:16,900
Yeah.

827
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:23,860
Thanks, Yuki-chan.

828
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,030
I wasn't wrong.

829
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:29,040
Saving a cat...

830
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,910
Feeling lost and down...

831
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,630
That was all part of
finding out who I am.

832
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,210
You go ahead!

833
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:41,130
Thanks.

834
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,010
Where is Father?

835
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:44,340
Up there.

836
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,930
Father, you'll hurt yourself.
Please come down.

837
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:49,930
What a rash thing to do.

838
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:51,680
I will bring His Majesty back down.

839
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:08,700
We'll settle this with a duel!

840
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,490
My pleasure!

841
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:11,670
Baron!

842
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:12,910
Take care of Haru!

843
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:13,750
Right.

844
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:02,960
I win, King.

845
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,010
Drat!

846
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,810
I've heard about a statue of a cat
that doesn't mind his own business.

847
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:22,070
I had no idea you were this good.

848
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:26,280
I heard you were just a window
display, standing in some back alley.

849
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:31,280
You should have come to
my Kingdom and join me.

850
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,040
Unfortunately, I'm quite happy
with my present way of life.

851
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:44,210
Where am I?!

852
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,470
What did you do?

853
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,550
I didn't do a thing.

854
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,350
With the tower collapsed this much,

855
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:58,060
I wouldn't be surprised if the exit
moved to a different point.

856
01:03:58,310 --> 01:03:59,610
I must go!

857
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:06,570
Haru-sama!

858
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:08,240
I should have foreseen this.

859
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,120
But look! Haru-chan is human again!

860
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:21,040
I think I'm going to fall.

861
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:23,590
Oh no, I'm falling.

862
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,880
I'm going down!

863
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:29,800
Haru!

864
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:41,100
Muta-san, please don't say I'm heavy.

865
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:45,190
Hang on... but next time...

866
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:49,110
Lose some weight!

867
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,660
I can't hold on!

868
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,160
Haru!

869
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:15,050
I'm going to die!

870
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:17,550
You're not dead yet!
Open your eyes!

871
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:18,470
Baron?

872
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:19,470
Straighten up,

873
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:21,180
and look down!

874
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:24,120
I can't!

875
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:26,180
Trust me!

876
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,320
Are we... still alive?

877
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,030
Yes!

878
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:41,280
I think so!

879
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,920
You know what?

880
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,380
We look fantastic!

881
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:10,430
What is this?

882
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,060
There are so many of them.

883
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:15,110
We're saved.

884
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:23,990
Hey, Muta!

885
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:26,530
How is it, being saved by birds?

886
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:27,540
Toto-san!

887
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,620
Oh, it's lousy black bird.

888
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,290
Thanks for saving us, Toto.

889
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:34,830
Glad I had my friends
waiting up here.

890
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:37,590
Doesn't it hurt walking on them?

891
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,760
You're light as a feather, Haru.

892
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,630
Really?

893
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:42,110
I disagree.

894
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:43,470
Look, Haru!

895
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:46,430
It's my school!

896
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,180
I'm home. I was able to
come back!

897
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:52,430
Everybody, thank you so much!

898
01:06:58,070 --> 01:06:59,480
Yes! They made it!

899
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,940
Hooray, Haru-sama!

900
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:02,030
I'm relieved.

901
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,070
Take care, Haru-chan!

902
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:07,740
Your Majesty!

903
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,330
Natori.

904
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:18,630
My time on the throne is over.

905
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:21,420
Then I must resign with you.

906
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:32,600
Toto-san, thank you.

907
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:37,770
My heart is still pounding.

908
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:39,060
Of course.

909
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:41,190
But it was a bit fun.

910
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,610
Yeah, right.

911
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:46,450
Haru has to go to school,

912
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:50,030
so she'd better go home and rest.

913
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:51,620
Yeah.

914
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:54,370
Is this going to be goodbye?

915
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:56,290
Must do one last thing.

916
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:13,810
Baron, I might have
a crush on you.

917
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:18,650
I admire your sincerity, Haru.

918
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:26,820
Haru, when you really need us,

919
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:30,240
our doors will open to you again.

920
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:34,160
Until then, goodbye!

921
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:41,000
Goodbye.

922
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:52,010
Thank you!

923
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:56,230
Baron! Toto-san!
You too, Muta-san!

924
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:01,110
What do you mean, me too?

925
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:04,650
Me too?

926
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:39,100
Oh no, better get up.

927
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:48,530
Morning.

928
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:51,330
Why are you up so early?

929
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:53,570
Today is Sunday.

930
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:54,870
I'm going to the movies
with Hiromi.

931
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:56,490
Going early before
it gets crowded.

932
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:58,950
I better get going.

933
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,790
I made eggs and salad for you.

934
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:03,460
What?

935
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:05,130
I already ate, so please
help yourself.

936

There is also English tea
in the pot.

937
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:09,880
And about the tea...

938
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:13,300
That's Haru-chan's special blend.

939
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:17,310
It's a bit different each time,
so no guarantees about the flavor.

944

Machida, he broke up!

945

Oh, he did, huh?

946
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,710
What kind of reaction is that?

947
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:47,800
What?

948
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,880
Don't you have more
to say than that?

949
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,260
No.
