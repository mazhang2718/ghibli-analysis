15
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:13,187
With ten days off,
I figured you'd go abroad.

16
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:15,985
But you're off to Yamagata, right?

17
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:17,081
Yes.

18
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:19,425
Broke up with your boyfriend?

19
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:22,360
I just prefer the countryside.

20
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:23,698
- See ya!
- Bye!

21
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:25,164
Let's go play!

22
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:26,833
Bye now!

23
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:28,674
Later!

24
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:31,149
Did you get good grades?

25
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,346
No. But I don't care.

26
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:35,287
How come?

27
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:38,557
As soon as I get home,
we're traveling to Grandma's.

28
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:40,963
So I won't get yelled at for ages.

29
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:44,234
Lucky you!
Are you going away too?

30
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,243
Yeah, to Nagano.
How about you, Taeko?

31
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:48,244
I'm not sure.

32
00:02:48,548 --> 00:02:50,984
My Dad bought a summer place.

33
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:52,745
Wow... that's great!

34
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:57,628
Such a bad grade in math again.

35
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:01,234
But I got a "B" in science.

36
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:04,265
Are we going away for the holidays?

37
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:05,808
Not really.

38
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:08,547
Take me someplace.

39
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:13,613
I'll take you to a movie.
Find out what's playing.

40
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:16,752
Not that. I mean to the country...

41
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,762
The country?

42
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,232
Like Grandma's country house.

43
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:21,826
Grandma lives with us.

44
00:03:21,937 --> 00:03:24,305
- Grandpa's then...
- He's dead.

45
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:28,507
We don't have relatives
in the country, so don't ask.

46
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:36,561
<i>My family had lived in Tokyo
for generations.</i>

47
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:39,725
<i>I envied friends who had family
in the countryside.</i>

48
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,802
It's too late to book.
All hotels will be full.

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,112
But I really want to go...

50
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:50,547
What about "Onoya"?

51
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,819
We're regulars.
They'd have a room for us.

52
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:56,089
Where's that?

53
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:59,657
Good idea.
Taeko's never been there.

54
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:00,930
That's right.

55
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:03,804
Is it in the mountains... by the sea?

56
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:05,805
It's in Atami.

57
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,039
Atami?

58
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,780
You get to ride the bullet train.

59
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:12,881
Sure, you ll love it.

60
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,656
Atami...

61
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:20,532
Lots of different hot springs...

62
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:23,867
There's a huge Roman Bath.

63
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:29,784
And others, like
the Swan Bath and the Violet Bath.

64
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:31,685
The beautiful Violet Bath!

65
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:34,021
The Violet Bath...

66
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:36,426
Oh yes. It's fantastic.

67
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:38,364
You love hot springs, right?

68
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,838
Since father's working,
you four go.

69
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:44,336
What?!

70
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:49,249
Us?

71
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:50,787
Go too?!

72
00:04:57,534 --> 00:05:01,371
I'm amazed you show up every morning.

73
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:04,172
Everyone else has left town.

74
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:08,781
Aren't you going anywhere?

75
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:10,487
- Yes, I am.
- Where?

76
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,648
Atami.

77
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:15,056
Atami? What's in Atami?

78
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:16,963
Hot springs.

79
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:22,399
It's good timing.

80
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,506
We're going away next week.

81
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:30,178
No-one will be around for ages.

82
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:34,828
<i>Hello. Okajima residence.</i>

83
00:05:34,932 --> 00:05:37,732
Nanako? It's Taeko.

84
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:42,334
I leave today. Any message for
your husband's family?

85
00:05:42,878 --> 00:05:47,342
<i>Not really. Just buy them something.</i>

86
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:50,288
<i>Say it's from us and
I'll pay you back.</i>

87
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:53,830
Don't worry about it. How's Mom?

88
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,455
<i>She's out today.</i>

89
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:59,937
<i>She was mad you turned down
that guy's proposal.</i>

90
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:03,908
<i>"At 27, that's the best offer
she's going to get!"</i>

91
00:06:04,014 --> 00:06:06,610
It's all she talks about.

92
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:10,590
<i>She's got a point.
You're not young anymore...</i>

93
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:11,887
Oh, yeah?

94
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:13,486
<i>Definitely.</i>

95
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:15,999
<i>You've got to settle down eventually.</i>

96
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:20,599
<i>By the way, did you really work
in the fields last year?</i>

97
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:24,375
Yes, harvesting rice.
This year, I'm picking safflower.

98
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:25,508
<i>Safflower?</i>

99
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:29,648
Thanks to you, I finally have family
in the countryside.

100
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:33,230
So, I'm making the most of it!

101
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:36,331
<i>Give me a break!</i>

102
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:40,174
<i>Rather than stay in that old house,</i>

103
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:44,272
<i>why not treat yourself
to a fancy hotel for once?</i>

104
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,478
Maybe you'd meet a nice boy.

105
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:51,218
No way. You mean
a hotel like "Onoya"?

106
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:52,729
<i>"Onoya"?</i>

107
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:56,962
<i>Not that again!</i>

108
00:06:57,773 --> 00:07:00,242
<i>You've got to get over it.</i>

109
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:03,407
<i>Let go of that baggage from the past!</i>

110
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:17,798
<i>My sisters, of course, would never
go to a place like atami.</i>

111
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:21,777
Grandma...

112
00:07:22,882 --> 00:07:24,681
Almost done?

113
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,453
Let's go to another bath.

114
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:29,959
We just went.

115
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:32,691
Only to the Swan Bath.

116
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:39,242
<i>Bored to tears, I went alone
to the Brothers Grimm Bath</i>

117
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:42,647
<i>the Mermaid Bath, the Lemon Bath,</i>

118
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:46,085
<i>and the Violet Bath,
one after the other.</i>

119
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:48,215
It's enormous!

120
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:52,254
<i>When I got to the Roman Bath,
my head was spinning.</i>

121
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:55,963
It's amazing...

122
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,686
<i>And I fainted.</i>

123
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:11,259
<i>And with that, my trip was over.</i>

124
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:15,134
<i>Followed by endless weeks of vacation.</i>

125
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:34,863
<i>The other day, my sisters and I
were reminiscing.</i>

126
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,743
<i>We couldn't stop laughing</i>

127
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:43,213
<i>as the memories came flooding back.</i>

128
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:49,323
Had one before?

129
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:51,127
No, it's my first time.

130
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,263
I'm the one who asked for it.

131
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,599
Yeah, we know.

132
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:56,972
Where did you buy it?

133
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:58,443
Senbikiya in Ginza.

134
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:00,014
Must have been expensive.

135
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:03,213
How do we eat it?

136
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:04,549
Slice it into rings.

137
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:06,125
But how?

138
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:09,563
I don't know.

139
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,965
Didn't you ask in the store?

140
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:20,974
We'll eat it next Sunday.

141
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:23,486
Why not now?!

142
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:26,149
We don't know how.

143
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:30,831
I'll have a banana.

144
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:32,562
Me too.

145
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:40,380
Strange fruit they have
in those hot countries.

146
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:44,690
I'm home!

147
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:47,028
I know how to eat the pineapple!

148
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,427
Really?

149
00:09:53,206 --> 00:09:54,606
I'll take that.

150
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:56,640
Mind your fingers.

151
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:59,045
Wouldn't a carving knife be best?

152
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:14,231
What a nice smell.

153
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:25,551
It smells so good.

154
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:29,432
I see.

155
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:31,993
Get plates. Quick.

156
00:10:32,105 --> 00:10:34,371
Okay.

157
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:37,442
Let us eat.

158
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:00,949
It's hard.

159
00:11:05,262 --> 00:11:06,992
It's not very good.

160
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:08,657
Not so sweet.

161
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,829
Nothing like the canned stuff.

162
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:14,776
Live long enough and you see
lots of different things.

163
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:22,421
- You can have mine.
- Mine too.

164
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:53,873
It's delicious...

165
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:01,654
Don't force yourself.

166
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,352
You'll get a stomachache.

167
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:15,579
What a let down.

168
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,451
Bananas taste much better.

169
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:21,786
You're so right.

170
00:12:21,893 --> 00:12:25,024
Bananas are still the king of fruits.

171
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:26,395
I ll have one now.

172
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,848
The king of fruit is...

173
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:59,219
<i>the banana, after all.</i>

174
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:09,202
<i>The year I fainted at the baths and
had my first pineapple...</i>

175
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:14,011
<i>the Beatles came to Japan,
started the rock 'n'roll band</i>

176
00:13:14,115 --> 00:13:16,984
<i>and electric guitar craze.</i>

177
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,296
<i>My sister Nanako, a freshman in
art school, was up on all the trends.</i>

178
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:28,471
Yeah, the Beatles'lyrics are great.

179
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:36,281
<i>When she wore a mini-skirt, she'd
cover her bottom going up the stairs.</i>

180
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:44,692
<i>My clever sister, Yaeko, was crazy
about some Takarazuka actress.</i>

181
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,133
Yaeko...

182
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:49,168
I told you to knock!

183
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:58,856
<i>My sisters' memories are
mainly of fashion and pop trends.</i>

184
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:04,223
<i>For them, 1966 is the
height of nostalgia.</i>

185
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:08,166
<i>Whereas I was only ten years old.</i>

186
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:12,945
<i>My favorite band had yet to debut....</i>

187
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:17,682
<i>My only memories are the back and
forth between school and home.</i>

188
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,760
...mine was pinned on the wall!

189
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:22,023
That's nice.

190
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:26,504
And it might be entered in
an essay contest.

191
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:29,202
So, teacher kept it.

192
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:33,081
- I'd be so happy...
- You didn't finish lunch again.

193
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:36,252
Why do you hide the pickles
inside the bread?

194
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:38,257
'Cause I hate them.

195
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:41,957
I've got to throw it away.
What a waste.

196
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,533
Such a picky eater!

197
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:51,541
I'd rather you were a good eater
than a good essay writer.

198
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,279
How can you drink that stuff?

199
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:16,756
Milk's okay. It's onions I hate.

200
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:20,524
I'm leaving carrots
so I've got no choice.

201
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,965
Who decided we can only
leave one thing?

202
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:27,201
Shall I drink it?

203
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,539
Would you?

204
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,873
You'll eat my onions next time?

205
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,638
- Carrots?
- We're allowed one thing!

206
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:57,891
Two bowls is gross.

207
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,323
People who run in the corridor...

208
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:06,536
...when the hall monitor says
stop, should be punished.

209
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:10,073
How are you gonna do that?

210
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:12,050
They shouldn't do it.

211
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,345
That's right.

212
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:15,423
You might bump into someone.

213
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:19,862
If I bumped into you
I'd bounce a mile!

214
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:21,093
Get lost!

215
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:25,669
Running is no big deal.

216
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,869
I agree!

217
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:30,482
- Let's change the rule.
- But we already decided.

218
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:33,212
Raise your hand if you want to speak.

219
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:35,782
- Here!
- Miss Tani.

220
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:41,333
The hall monitor
should chase the offender,

221
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:43,963
catch them and punish them.

222
00:16:45,443 --> 00:16:46,843
Mr. Suzuki.

223
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:51,748
Then the hall monitor should
be punished for running too.

224
00:16:51,854 --> 00:16:53,288
He's right! He's right!

225
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:55,248
Way to go!

226
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,428
He's right.

227
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,520
Miss Tani.

228
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:03,900
The hall monitor shouldn't
be punished because...

229
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:09,543
...it's like a policeman
chasing a speeding car.

230
00:17:15,862 --> 00:17:18,024
Any objections?

231
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:21,664
It makes sense...

232
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:23,502
No more running.

233
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:29,416
So, the hall monitor
can chase offenders.

234
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:33,023
Any other issues?

235
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,660
Miss Tani.

236
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,855
- Her again.
- Busybody.

237
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,298
Be quiet.

238
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:41,803
Some people don't finish lunch.

239
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:47,008
I just read an article
on the Vietnam War.

240
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:50,981
There are many
unfortunate people overseas.

241
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:52,648
We're very lucky.

242
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:54,659
Lucky to have you near me!

243
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:01,305
We should be grateful for our food.

244
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:06,244
We're allowed to leave
one thing on our plates,

245
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:08,149
but I think it's wrong!

246
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,522
Goody two-shoes.

247
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:18,424
- It can't hurt to leave one thing.
- Let's all leave milk...

248
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:21,700
- Give it to someone else...
- Of course.

249
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:25,906
- People hide leftovers in bread.
- That's cheating!

250
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:28,050
I hate school food.

251
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:30,855
If you want to speak,
raise your hand!

252
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:34,117
What a revolting situation.

253
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:40,972
<i>That night in bed,
after chatting to my sisters</i>

254
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:45,747
<i>more memories from fifth grade</i>

255
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:49,309
<i>came rushing back.</i>

256
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:57,026
<i>Our pet dog... . School sports day...</i>

257
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:00,465
<i>being scared by gross
horror comics....</i>

258
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:04,507
<i>longing for an electric
pencil-sharpener...</i>

259
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:10,347
<i>So many little details,
one after the other...</i>

260
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:14,820
<i>playing in my head like a movie,</i>

261
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:17,925
<i>almost overpowering me.</i>

262
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:24,704
Is there a Miss Okajima here?

263
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:27,374
That's her.

264
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,673
Hirota in our class
says he likes you.

265
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:48,681
Let's go.

266
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:54,563
We'll say we told you.

267
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,968
Told you.

268
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:05,481
Where is it?

269
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:06,610
Over there.

270
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,382
Shuji Hirota and Taeko Oka jima

271
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:10,287
lt's true!

272
00:20:13,064 --> 00:20:14,897
What's he like?

273
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:16,629
- No idea.
- Me, neither.

274
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:19,230
Taeko, you sure you don't know him?

275
00:20:19,342 --> 00:20:22,040
No... of course not... not at all.

276
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:29,224
Which one is Hirota?

277
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:30,585
It's the girls from Room 5.

278
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:32,788
Hirota, they're looking for you.

279
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,159
I'm here!

280
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:40,901
Don't write silly things on the wall.

281
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:43,445
Taeko told us to tell you.

282
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:45,609
I didn't write anything.

283
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,419
You said you liked
Okajima in Room 5.

284
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:50,789
You did.

285
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:52,420
So, we wrote it for you.

286
00:20:54,235 --> 00:20:57,673
<i>I love you so much....</i>

287
00:20:57,774 --> 00:21:01,577
<i>But you're so far away....</i>

288
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:04,049
<i>Like gazing up at...</i>

289
00:21:04,152 --> 00:21:05,380
Goodbye.

290
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:08,720
<i>A far distant star.</i>

291
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:13,528
Taeko!

292
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:17,536
We just went to see Hirota.

293
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:23,574
We told him not to
write things on walls.

294
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:26,049
Tsuneko!

295
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:27,646
Ah, no running.

296
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,328
Aren't you glad?

297
00:21:41,281 --> 00:21:44,684
<i>5th Grade: Room 4</i>

298
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:53,234
Over here.

299
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:56,469
See? That's him.

300
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:06,723
What? Hirota likes Taeko?

301
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:10,125
He's amazing. A real star.

302
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,063
You mean baseball?

303
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:14,501
Only Tono can hit his pitches.

304
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:16,938
Really?

305
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,004
Our team plays his
in the next game.

306
00:22:27,627 --> 00:22:30,792
Go, go, Hirota!

307
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,372
Go for it, Tono!

308
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,405
Hit it, Tono!

309
00:22:37,845 --> 00:22:39,336
Kill it!

310
00:22:41,217 --> 00:22:43,653
Go for it, Hirota!

311
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,620
Taeko's watching you!

312
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,669
Hit it, Tono!

313
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,832
Way to go, Hirota!

314
00:23:11,135 --> 00:23:12,899
Strike him out!

315
00:23:13,505 --> 00:23:16,271
Don't you dare cheer their side!

316
00:23:16,377 --> 00:23:18,438
Of course not!

317
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:22,384
Go, go, Tono!

318
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,411
Hiro, Hiro, Hirota!

319
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,482
Hit it!

320
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:43,814
One leg stance!

321
00:23:58,115 --> 00:23:59,378
Wow!

322
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:04,615
Way to go, Hirota!

323
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:11,469
<i>I knew nothing about baseball.</i>

324
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:14,303
<i>But even I could tell he was superb.</i>

325
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:25,327
Go, go, Hirota!

326
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:29,596
What's up, Taeko?

327
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:35,906
<i>Between the cold and the excitement,
I ran to the bathroom five times.</i>

328
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,671
Over here, over here!

329
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:44,285
Game!

330
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:50,094
Room 4 wins.

331
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:52,869
Thank you for the game.

332
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:55,976
You were great Hirota!

333
00:24:56,081 --> 00:24:57,208
Good job.

334
00:24:57,316 --> 00:24:59,217
You were amazing!

335
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,521
It was all your fault.

336
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:02,682
How come?

337
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,226
You don't know anything.

338
00:25:04,762 --> 00:25:07,996
If Tono couldn't hit him,
how could we?

339
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:09,228
That's right.

340
00:25:09,704 --> 00:25:14,041
You missed the throw and
three runs scored.

341
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,943
That's not true.

342
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,080
Coach said he'd buy us ice cream.

343
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:20,917
- Really?
- Great!

344
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:24,485
Hirota, you should go see her.

345
00:25:24,596 --> 00:25:26,258
Yeah, you should.

346
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:30,829
I'm going home.

347
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:34,072
What's the matter, Taeko?

348
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:39,853
Look, she left.

349
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:29,702
Um...

350
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:40,215
...that stuff...

351
00:26:40,993 --> 00:26:44,762
...on the wall...

352
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,503
Rainy day or...

353
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:53,772
cloudy or sunny day...

354
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:55,812
which do you like?

355
00:27:10,643 --> 00:27:11,406
Cloudy.

356
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:13,748
Me too!

357
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:58,686
Rainy day or cloudy or sunny day.

358
00:28:59,162 --> 00:29:01,189
Which do you like?

359
00:29:03,402 --> 00:29:05,031
Me, too.

360
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:29,914
<i>I didn't intend the ten year-old me
to come on this trip.</i>

361
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,185
<i>But somehow, once she showed up</i>

362
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:37,591
<i>she wouldn't leave me alone.</i>

363
00:30:07,412 --> 00:30:11,043
<i>But why me in the 5th grade?</i>

364
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:18,521
<i>Second hour, all boys play baseball,
all girls to the gym.</i>

365
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:19,428
<i>How come?</i>

366
00:30:19,532 --> 00:30:21,023
<i>Baseball, great!</i>

367
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:36,724
<i>Today I'm going to talk about
something very important.</i>

368
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:46,473
You'll leave grade school,
then junior school then high school.

369
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:50,017
Then become grown ups and have babies.

370
00:30:50,118 --> 00:30:54,114
A woman's body prepares
to have babies.

371
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:04,035
Did you know?

372
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:06,136
Really?

373
00:31:06,847 --> 00:31:09,943
Mom told me
when I was in fourth grade,

374
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:12,022
since I'm an early-developer.

375
00:31:12,123 --> 00:31:13,021
Early-developer?

376
00:31:13,124 --> 00:31:14,353
That's right.

377
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:19,260
She said tall girls or big girls
get their periods early.

378
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:22,673
I bet those other girls

379
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:24,774
already have theirs.

380
00:31:30,988 --> 00:31:32,684
- Are you gonna buy them?
- I am.

381
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,020
I knew it.

382
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:36,286
You'll buy them, too, right?

383
00:31:36,498 --> 00:31:38,934
Well... yeah.

384
00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:41,369
I think you should.

385
00:31:41,573 --> 00:31:46,309
Nurse said
we all need them eventually.

386
00:31:46,415 --> 00:31:47,781
That's true.

387
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:04,270
The girls are buying underpants
in the infirmary.

388
00:32:07,617 --> 00:32:09,917
Did you know?

389
00:32:10,022 --> 00:32:11,011
No.

390
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:13,093
But why?

391
00:32:14,262 --> 00:32:16,424
How come you're buying underpants?

392
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:18,865
It's because...

393
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,063
Umm...

394
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,271
Why is the school selling underpants?

395
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,935
Are they for swimming?

396
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:29,378
You told Nakayama?

397
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:31,419
Why did you do that!?

398
00:32:31,525 --> 00:32:33,323
You shouldn't tell boys.

399
00:32:33,428 --> 00:32:36,160
It's supposed to be our secret.

400
00:32:40,774 --> 00:32:44,177
It's because she likes him...

401
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,010
Did he ask you?

402
00:32:51,893 --> 00:32:52,861
What's going on?

403
00:32:52,961 --> 00:32:56,263
She told Nakayama about periods.

404
00:32:56,568 --> 00:32:58,196
No!

405
00:32:58,704 --> 00:33:01,402
He'll tell everyone.

406
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:02,875
I said to keep it secret.

407
00:33:02,978 --> 00:33:05,608
You trust him?

408
00:33:08,923 --> 00:33:12,452
- Oh no...
- Boys are disgusting.

409
00:33:12,662 --> 00:33:14,894
Now they'll be looking up our skirts.

410
00:33:19,006 --> 00:33:20,098
Pervert!

411
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:25,917
<i>Looking up skirts was all the rage
and periods became an obsession.</i>

412
00:33:26,018 --> 00:33:28,487
You got your period!

413
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,856
Cut it out!

414
00:33:32,862 --> 00:33:34,889
<i>Second period break.</i>

415
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,865
Idiot.

416
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:37,061
Ouch.

417
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:38,138
Come here!

418
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,941
You've got a period.

419
00:33:42,045 --> 00:33:43,673
No, I don't!

420
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,949
It's all Rie's fault.

421
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,457
I'm sorry.

422
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:54,726
What for?

423
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:57,270
For telling Nakayama.

424
00:33:57,372 --> 00:33:58,840
It doesn't matter.

425
00:33:59,308 --> 00:34:03,179
The nurse said it's very important.

426
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:05,414
I know.

427
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,549
I started when I was in fourth grade.

428
00:34:08,658 --> 00:34:09,887
Really?

429
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:14,495
That's why I skip P. E. Sometimes.

430
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:17,169
You skip P. E. With a period?

431
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:20,334
Mom said I should.

432
00:34:21,613 --> 00:34:26,144
He even said he felt sorry for us.

433
00:34:26,622 --> 00:34:28,784
You told him about skipping P. E.?

434
00:34:30,294 --> 00:34:33,858
He promised not to tell the others.

435
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:35,526
So, then they'll think

436
00:34:35,937 --> 00:34:38,806
all girls who skip P. E. Have periods!

437
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:40,236
You think so?

438
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:41,370
Of course!

439
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:48,918
<i>Please excuse Taeko from P. E.
Because of her cold.</i>

440
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:56,129
I'm not missing P. E.

441
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,041
Your cold will get worse.

442
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:01,876
Then I'll stay home.

443
00:35:02,082 --> 00:35:03,914
No. You don't have a fever.

444
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:05,576
Then I'll do P. E.

445
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:07,247
Fine, go ahead.

446
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:10,190
Don't blame me if it gets worse.

447
00:35:14,102 --> 00:35:15,661
See you later.

448
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,036
Since when was she so fond of P. E.?

449
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,492
You're bright red.

450
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:30,028
She's right.

451
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,530
Are you okay?

452
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:32,594
I have a cold.

453
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:34,366
You have a fever.

454
00:35:34,471 --> 00:35:35,700
You should skip P. E.

455
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:37,332
Yeah, you should.

456
00:35:37,443 --> 00:35:39,071
I'll go tell the teacher.

457
00:35:39,312 --> 00:35:40,405
No, don't.

458
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:41,743
Why not?

459
00:35:42,317 --> 00:35:44,378
Mom already wrote a note.

460
00:35:44,788 --> 00:35:47,554
There's no problem then.

461
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,790
Out of the way!

462
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:53,726
Ouch!

463
00:35:58,846 --> 00:36:02,306
I'm missing P. E. Too.
Just like you.

464
00:36:09,664 --> 00:36:11,326
Lucky them.

465
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:14,637
I wish I could play, too.

466
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,811
Do you...

467
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:24,654
...are you having a period?

468
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:26,116
Yes.

469
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:30,297
I'm not. I have a cold.

470
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:33,131
I know. You're sick.

471
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:35,969
Just sick. That's all.

472
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,106
A period isn't a sickness.

473
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:48,261
I could still play...

474
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,270
I'm gonna catch a period!

475
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:55,803
Don't touch it, don't touch it!

476
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:59,043
That was close.
Almost caught it...

477
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,686
Over here, over here!

478
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:08,387
"Catch a period"!

479
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,732
What a silly thing to say.

480
00:37:15,476 --> 00:37:17,275
It's no laughing matter!

481
00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:22,253
Taeko?

482
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,269
It's the period pair!

483
00:37:31,404 --> 00:37:32,736
No, we're not!

484
00:37:33,407 --> 00:37:34,875
Stupid boys.

485
00:37:43,491 --> 00:37:45,723
You're so calm about it.

486
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:50,996
Mom said it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

487
00:37:51,638 --> 00:37:53,607
I guess so, but...

488
00:37:58,383 --> 00:38:02,379
<i>Like it or not,
a butterfly must first...</i>

489
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,527
<i>live as a caterpillar
before it can fly away.</i>

490
00:38:18,684 --> 00:38:21,120
<i>Maybe I remember those days because</i>

491
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:25,388
<i>I was going through the
caterpillar stage.</i>

492
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:33,609
<i>Something definitely changed
when I started working.</i>

493
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:41,182
<i>at work and at play we girls were
livelier and more spirited than guys.</i>

494
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:45,026
<i>It was like
we'd finally found our wings.</i>

495
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:49,429
<i>But looking back now,</i>

496
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:53,340
<i>maybe we were just
flexing them pointlessly.</i>

497
00:38:58,418 --> 00:39:00,684
<i>Perhaps the fifth grade me
was tagging along</i>

498
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:04,193
<i>with a message for me to reflect</i>

499
00:39:04,763 --> 00:39:07,563
<i>and rethink my life.</i>

500
00:39:13,678 --> 00:39:19,086
<i>Anyway, I decided to sleep
the rest of the way.</i>

501
00:40:05,934 --> 00:40:07,334
Ouch!

502
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,388
<i>Excuse me,
has the Tokyo train gone?</i>

503
00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:21,488
Was that your train?

504
00:40:21,594 --> 00:40:22,653
No...

505
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:32,440
Taeko Okajima, right?

506
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:34,739
Yes, that's correct...

507
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,648
Thank goodness.

508
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,286
The car's this way.

509
00:40:38,623 --> 00:40:41,253
Excuse me, but who are you?

510
00:40:41,628 --> 00:40:43,393
You don't remember?

511
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:46,263
Of course you don't.

512
00:40:47,939 --> 00:40:51,502
I'm Toshio. Kazuo s second cousin.

513
00:40:55,051 --> 00:40:57,043
Oh, I see...

514
00:41:04,634 --> 00:41:06,296
What's so funny?

515
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:09,408
Nothing. Sorry.

516
00:41:09,743 --> 00:41:13,512
I thought you were trying
to steal my bag.

517
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,324
That's terrible.
Didn't I ask your name?

518
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:24,924
Yes, you did.
I just thought... sorry...

519
00:41:26,738 --> 00:41:28,765
I beg your pardon.

520
00:41:28,876 --> 00:41:30,208
No problem.

521
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:34,847
Where's Kazuo?

522
00:41:35,153 --> 00:41:39,560
He asked me last night
to come pick you up

523
00:41:40,595 --> 00:41:41,927
It's been raining?

524
00:41:42,031 --> 00:41:44,763
Yeah, but it'll clear today.

525
00:41:46,105 --> 00:41:49,167
I should've used my Dad's car

526
00:41:51,114 --> 00:41:53,276
but I like mine better.

527
00:41:56,857 --> 00:41:58,723
It's a little tight.

528
00:42:14,286 --> 00:42:15,879
May I leave it on?

529
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:17,480
Sure.

530
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:49,469
This is unusual music.

531
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,478
It's a Hungarian group.

532
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,954
Hungarian?

533
00:42:56,892 --> 00:42:58,623
You know a lot about it?

534
00:42:58,896 --> 00:43:01,058
A little. It's farmer's music.

535
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:02,863
I like it because I'm a farmer.

536
00:43:03,837 --> 00:43:05,135
Cool.

537
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,032
Right?

538
00:43:30,283 --> 00:43:34,450
Remember last year's party
at the farmhouse?

539
00:43:36,694 --> 00:43:40,257
A bunch of guys
turned up, right?

540
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:42,326
Maybe you don't remember.

541
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:48,613
They came to check out
the girl from Tokyo.

542
00:43:48,714 --> 00:43:50,684
I was one of them.

543
00:43:53,055 --> 00:43:54,250
Watch out, jerk!

544
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:10,775
I heard you're picking safflower.
Do you dye fabric?

545
00:44:10,886 --> 00:44:13,413
Just curious.

546
00:44:13,524 --> 00:44:18,989
Safflower's kind of unusual.
Well, maybe not for you.

547
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:24,804
It's known as a famous
local product but

548
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,176
hardly anyone grows it.

549
00:44:27,448 --> 00:44:32,013
- Wasn't it big in the old days?
- For the merchants, sure.

550
00:44:32,556 --> 00:44:37,053
They got rich, but for farmers,
it was just another crop.

551
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:45,173
Do you know: In time whose skin
will it grace, this crimson flower.

552
00:44:45,277 --> 00:44:49,341
The famous Basho poem?
I read it before coming.

553
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:51,017
Is that so?

554
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:54,284
I only learned it last night.

555
00:44:57,432 --> 00:45:00,403
I also read that the flower-pickers

556
00:45:00,837 --> 00:45:06,108
couldn't afford to wear
the rouge they made.

557
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,596
Is that where you had the barbeque?

558
00:45:17,866 --> 00:45:20,894
There'll be another this year, too.

559
00:45:32,325 --> 00:45:36,424
Are market reforms making
agriculture difficult?

560
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:38,398
Absolutely.

561
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,667
As things go, Japanese farming
might just collapse,

562
00:45:41,774 --> 00:45:44,074
all of sudden, one day.

563
00:45:45,113 --> 00:45:46,445
But then again,

564
00:45:46,549 --> 00:45:51,922
anything worth struggling for
will be hard work.

565
00:45:52,025 --> 00:45:54,517
Isn't it the same in the city?

566
00:45:54,864 --> 00:45:55,922
Yes.

567
00:45:56,399 --> 00:46:00,201
But fewer people live for their work.

568
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,066
What about you?

569
00:46:04,045 --> 00:46:05,206
Me?

570
00:46:07,284 --> 00:46:12,487
I don't live for my job
but I don't hate it either.

571
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:17,630
I could farm twenty-four hours a day.

572
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:21,165
It's fascinating
to raise living things.

573
00:46:22,243 --> 00:46:24,235
You have livestock?

574
00:46:27,586 --> 00:46:31,923
Not that. We've got some animals,

575
00:46:32,027 --> 00:46:36,467
but I'm talking about rice, apples,
cherries. They're all living things.

576
00:46:37,436 --> 00:46:40,999
If we take good care of them,

577
00:46:41,108 --> 00:46:44,706
I feel like
they'll do their best for us.

578
00:46:48,355 --> 00:46:50,551
Listen to me preach.

579
00:46:50,959 --> 00:46:54,329
Not at all. I get what you mean.

580
00:46:54,432 --> 00:46:58,029
To tell the truth, I used to
work in an office.

581
00:46:58,137 --> 00:47:01,667
I only just started farming.

582
00:47:01,911 --> 00:47:04,814
Is that right?

583
00:47:05,484 --> 00:47:10,424
That's why I'm so enthusiastic.
It's very important.

584
00:47:11,928 --> 00:47:15,560
I quit work and joined
my friend's organic farm.

585
00:47:15,668 --> 00:47:19,197
People said I'm nuts,
but I don't regret it.

586
00:47:19,608 --> 00:47:21,770
Organic farm?

587
00:47:23,615 --> 00:47:27,884
"Grown with no
artificial chemicals whatsoever."

588
00:47:28,623 --> 00:47:32,221
Just blood, sweat and tears!

589
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:36,997
<i>We use all natural stuff,
no pesticides or anything.</i>

590
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:41,703
I've seen the labels:
"No chemicals used"

591
00:47:41,879 --> 00:47:44,851
But it's not just that.

592
00:47:44,951 --> 00:47:48,389
We bring out the plant's life force.

593
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:53,226
It's cool...
like lending nature a hand.

594
00:47:55,569 --> 00:47:58,939
Sounds easy, but it's damn hard work.

595
00:48:06,555 --> 00:48:09,355
I was told to take you straight
to the fields.

596
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,452
Yes, I'm starting right away.

597
00:48:11,563 --> 00:48:14,090
Not going to rest?

598
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:19,142
Don't you pick the flowers early
while the thorns are still soft?

599
00:48:19,243 --> 00:48:20,734
That's right, but...

600
00:48:20,846 --> 00:48:24,215
I'm trying to become an early-riser.

601
00:48:24,786 --> 00:48:27,382
That's why I took the night train.

602
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:30,223
You're certainly eager.

603
00:48:58,075 --> 00:48:59,373
There it is!

604
00:49:57,444 --> 00:49:59,675
'Morning, everyone!

605
00:50:09,031 --> 00:50:11,227
Great to have you back, Taeko.

606
00:50:11,334 --> 00:50:13,167
Thanks for having me.

607
00:50:14,907 --> 00:50:18,710
Grandma, you re looking well.

608
00:50:18,948 --> 00:50:21,247
Welcome back dear.

609
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,444
Aren't you tired?

610
00:50:22,955 --> 00:50:24,947
No, not at all.

611
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:28,158
We made your bed just in case.

612
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:31,461
That's okay. Look, I'm raring to go!

613
00:50:31,569 --> 00:50:35,736
Wearing work pants too!

614
00:50:37,179 --> 00:50:39,614
That's all I brought.

615
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:44,880
Young people here don't wear
them any more.

616
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,393
You look like the real thing Taeko.

617
00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:50,624
That's right.

618
00:51:13,775 --> 00:51:14,936
Taeko!

619
00:51:17,047 --> 00:51:18,037
Don't!

620
00:51:23,658 --> 00:51:27,620
<i>And so began my second
taste of country life.</i>

621
00:51:36,947 --> 00:51:42,412
<i>How could this yellow flower produce
such a bright red?</i>

622
00:51:43,091 --> 00:51:46,530
<i>They told me a sad tale
from the old days.</i>

623
00:51:47,264 --> 00:51:49,996
<i>The girls didn't have gloves,</i>

624
00:51:50,437 --> 00:51:55,776
<i>and their bare hands
would get pricked by the thorns.</i>

625
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,219
<i>It was their blood that
made the red so deep.</i>

626
00:52:01,355 --> 00:52:04,418
<i>I could imagine the resentment</i>

627
00:52:05,262 --> 00:52:10,226
<i>they must've felt
toward the fancy city girls.</i>

628
00:52:12,074 --> 00:52:16,480
<i>To make a handful of rouge took
nearly 500 lbs of petals.</i>

629
00:52:16,581 --> 00:52:22,718
<i>This rouge was literally worth
its weight in gold.</i>

630
00:53:49,573 --> 00:53:54,605
<i>The petals are washed, trodden,
then exposed to the air and the sun.</i>

631
00:53:54,716 --> 00:53:58,815
<i>As the petals oxidize,
they gradually turn red.</i>

632
00:54:02,128 --> 00:54:04,029
<i>After a few more days,</i>

633
00:54:04,131 --> 00:54:08,298
<i>fermentation turns them bright red
and they become sticky.</i>

634
00:54:11,411 --> 00:54:15,646
<i>Pounded, wrung into balls
and sun-dried, they finally become</i>

635
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:20,818
<i>the basic ingredient of rouge.</i>

636
00:54:25,902 --> 00:54:29,340
<i>The liquid from the pressing
wasn't wasted either.</i>

637
00:54:29,576 --> 00:54:32,570
<i>The red pigment in the yellow broth</i>

638
00:54:32,681 --> 00:54:36,119
<i>was used to dye fabric.</i>

639
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,711
<i>Let's go dye our cloth.</i>

640
00:54:38,557 --> 00:54:41,119
<i>Safflower do your best.</i>

641
00:54:41,229 --> 00:54:43,825
<i>Cheer me up with
your pretty color.</i>

642
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:48,264
<i>For those village girls,
with no chance of make-up or kimonos,</i>

643
00:54:48,374 --> 00:54:52,746
<i>Safflower dye brought color
into their drab lives.</i>

644
00:54:56,755 --> 00:55:02,061
<i>The yellow pigment dissolves in water
leaving clothes a light pink.</i>

645
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:04,157
So pretty!

646
00:55:06,372 --> 00:55:10,675
<i>Machines now take away
some of the work,</i>

647
00:55:11,013 --> 00:55:15,680
<i>but the petal's still need
picking every day.</i>

648
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:47,433
<i>Rouge cakes soon mould,
and the flowers wait for no one.</i>

649
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:53,848
<i>No sooner are you done picking,
than they bloom again.</i>

650
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:02,323
<i>When the rains come,
work continues into the early hours.</i>

651
00:56:04,738 --> 00:56:07,208
<i>Each day flew by,</i>

652
00:56:07,543 --> 00:56:12,985
<i>Pleasantly tired, I thought about
the flower-pickers of old.</i>

653
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:18,554
<i>If I could've worked
like this as a child,</i>

654
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:23,869
<i>my school essays would've been
really interesting.</i>

655
00:56:39,998 --> 00:56:41,660
Mom, I need 5,000 yen.

656
00:56:41,767 --> 00:56:44,329
5,000 yen? I can't give you that.

657
00:56:44,439 --> 00:56:48,003
You said you'd buy me new sneakers.

658
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:50,343
Are they that much?

659
00:56:51,351 --> 00:56:52,250
Nonsense.

660
00:56:52,353 --> 00:56:53,514
They're Pumas.

661
00:56:54,122 --> 00:56:56,524
- Pumas?
- It's a brand.

662
00:56:58,596 --> 00:57:03,401
I'm not sure.
There must be cheaper ones.

663
00:57:03,505 --> 00:57:05,531
How about the ones you've got?

664
00:57:05,642 --> 00:57:08,078
Nobody wears them now.

665
00:57:08,313 --> 00:57:11,341
Everyone's getting Pumas.

666
00:57:11,451 --> 00:57:12,646
Who's everyone?

667
00:57:12,754 --> 00:57:16,818
Kako, Megu, Yachan, Nonchan.

668
00:57:16,927 --> 00:57:18,988
That's only four people.

669
00:57:19,265 --> 00:57:22,532
Everyone's wearing them!

670
00:57:22,637 --> 00:57:26,167
No. You never do your chores.

671
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:30,717
Did you ask for a dress for
your Barbie Doll?

672
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:35,789
Didn't you promise to ask only at
Christmas and your birthday?

673
00:57:36,194 --> 00:57:38,527
You always spoil her.

674
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,462
Is that right, Taeko?

675
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:45,531
<i>All of a sudden,
the ten year-old me was back.</i>

676
00:57:45,811 --> 00:57:47,677
But...

677
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:52,678
Yaeko got a kimono and
it wasn't even her graduation.

678
00:57:53,023 --> 00:57:54,389
It's for tea-ceremony.

679
00:57:54,492 --> 00:57:58,123
You keep asking for
lots of little stuff,

680
00:57:58,231 --> 00:58:00,758
we get one or two big things.

681
00:58:00,902 --> 00:58:01,665
Right?

682
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:03,000
Yep.

683
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,276
Stop that.

684
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:11,252
Always picky about food.

685
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,526
Dad loves the onions, right?

686
00:58:17,498 --> 00:58:22,063
Anyway, that kimono will be
yours in the end.

687
00:58:22,507 --> 00:58:24,305
Always hand-me-downs.

688
00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:28,075
- Some people don't get anything.
- Exactly.

689
00:58:28,183 --> 00:58:31,211
Then give me that enamel purse.

690
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:32,846
Didn't you give it to her yet?

691
00:58:32,957 --> 00:58:37,192
You're too old for that.
Give it to her.

692
00:58:45,078 --> 00:58:46,307
I don't want it.

693
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,611
Keep the stupid purse.

694
00:58:52,057 --> 00:58:54,458
Then I won't give it to you.

695
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:56,855
I'm not buying you a new one.

696
00:58:56,965 --> 00:58:57,796
Fine.

697
00:58:58,734 --> 00:59:02,298
Good. I actually really like it.

698
00:59:02,675 --> 00:59:04,303
I hate it.

699
00:59:08,418 --> 00:59:11,583
Ready for dinner. Take this away.

700
00:59:11,691 --> 00:59:14,126
See, has to be thrown away.

701
00:59:14,228 --> 00:59:16,198
What a waste.

702
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:19,968
Don't throw it away! Please Mother.

703
00:59:20,071 --> 00:59:21,334
It's your fault.

704
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:24,440
Finish it yourself next time.

705
00:59:26,148 --> 00:59:28,675
You three are so selfish.

706
00:59:40,573 --> 00:59:44,740
Father, buy me an enamel purse.

707
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:49,415
Yaeko won't give me hers.

708
00:59:49,554 --> 00:59:51,387
You said you didn't want it.

709
00:59:53,461 --> 00:59:55,157
Yeah, but...

710
00:59:55,264 --> 00:59:57,928
You said it, you have to do it.

711
01:00:05,683 --> 01:00:07,845
Hurry up and get ready.

712
01:00:10,757 --> 01:00:13,125
I'll wear these!

713
01:00:14,864 --> 01:00:18,598
Why is Yaeko coming?

714
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:24,537
You said it was just the three of us.

715
01:00:25,383 --> 01:00:29,755
Because I finished my homework.
Is that a problem?

716
01:00:30,324 --> 01:00:33,386
It's Chinese food.
The more the merrier.

717
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:36,296
Grandma's not coming.

718
01:00:36,402 --> 01:00:39,100
She doesn't eat oily food.

719
01:00:39,407 --> 01:00:41,842
If you don't want to come, stay here.

720
01:01:06,987 --> 01:01:09,355
We're going Taeko.

721
01:01:10,727 --> 01:01:12,195
Come on slowpoke.

722
01:01:15,134 --> 01:01:17,468
I don't have a purse.

723
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:22,611
Lend her that enamel one.

724
01:01:47,523 --> 01:01:48,354
Here.

725
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:51,222
Ouch.

726
01:01:51,864 --> 01:01:53,264
Let's go.

727
01:01:53,633 --> 01:01:54,965
I'm not going.

728
01:01:55,069 --> 01:01:57,835
Okay. Let's go Mother.

729
01:01:58,275 --> 01:02:00,676
Stay with Grandma then.

730
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:09,183
Not coming Taeko?

731
01:02:09,661 --> 01:02:10,856
No I'm not.

732
01:02:28,993 --> 01:02:30,291
We're off then.

733
01:02:40,012 --> 01:02:41,605
I'm coming too!

734
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:55,937
No shoes!

735
01:03:00,748 --> 01:03:02,740
Father please.

736
01:03:27,794 --> 01:03:29,660
A button came off.

737
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:44,612
We didn't go out, of course.

738
01:03:44,723 --> 01:03:47,159
My face was swollen and a cold towel

739
01:03:47,261 --> 01:03:49,629
didn't stop the stinging.

740
01:03:50,066 --> 01:03:52,832
That night I couldn't sleep

741
01:03:52,937 --> 01:03:55,772
wondering why it was always me.

742
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:58,311
Figuring I must've been adopted

743
01:03:58,747 --> 01:04:01,343
I cried myself to sleep.

744
01:04:02,086 --> 01:04:05,320
Was it the first time he hit you?

745
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:08,954
Yes, the first and only time.

746
01:04:10,668 --> 01:04:15,301
Dad slaps me often... well, sometimes.

747
01:04:15,409 --> 01:04:18,437
Maybe that's easier.

748
01:04:18,547 --> 01:04:22,316
<i>When it's only once,
you can't stop thinking why.</i>

749
01:04:23,088 --> 01:04:27,654
It's hard to imagine you
a selfish brat.

750
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,690
A spoiled brat.

751
01:04:30,802 --> 01:04:33,739
I wasn't just fussy about
onions, either.

752
01:04:35,476 --> 01:04:38,709
Now I don't feel like I'm that bad.

753
01:04:38,815 --> 01:04:40,717
Wait a second!

754
01:04:40,819 --> 01:04:45,623
Your poor Mom.
I shouldn't encourage you.

755
01:04:51,938 --> 01:04:54,534
I'm giving up on the Pumas.

756
01:04:54,643 --> 01:04:55,941
Good girl.

757
01:04:56,279 --> 01:05:00,343
Maybe I'll slip you some pocket money.

758
01:05:00,453 --> 01:05:01,751
Hooray!

759
01:05:24,093 --> 01:05:25,287
Hey!

760
01:05:27,432 --> 01:05:28,957
100 yen each.

761
01:05:35,446 --> 01:05:36,242
Taeko...

762
01:05:36,347 --> 01:05:37,576
Tomorrow...

763
01:05:37,849 --> 01:05:41,288
Let's go for a drive to Zao.

764
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:43,319
- Zao?
- Yes.

765
01:05:44,227 --> 01:05:46,389
You went to Yamadera
last year, right?

766
01:05:46,565 --> 01:05:48,591
The family said it was okay.

767
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,676
<i>The views at Zao were beautiful.</i>

768
01:06:18,018 --> 01:06:22,355
<i>But Zao had become famous
and touristy.</i>

769
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,634
How come you re not married?

770
01:06:29,738 --> 01:06:33,905
Do you find that strange?

771
01:06:34,112 --> 01:06:36,582
Well, no, not really.

772
01:06:36,917 --> 01:06:39,683
Lots of women work now.

773
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:43,283
Most of my friends are single.

774
01:06:43,495 --> 01:06:45,259
Oh, is that right?

775
01:06:45,365 --> 01:06:46,731
That's right.

776
01:06:47,001 --> 01:06:48,333
I see.

777
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:49,829
It's true.

778
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:51,766
Right.

779
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:54,138
Really. It's very common.

780
01:07:00,658 --> 01:07:02,092
Toshio?

781
01:07:02,293 --> 01:07:06,027
In elementary school, could you
do fractions?

782
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:12,736
When they said reverse the numerator
and denominator, could you do it?

783
01:07:12,845 --> 01:07:15,680
I don't remember.

784
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:18,911
I wasn't bad at math though.

785
01:07:19,022 --> 01:07:20,388
I see.

786
01:07:20,658 --> 01:07:21,819
Lucky you.

787
01:07:21,927 --> 01:07:25,092
I bet you don't remember
'cause it was easy.

788
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,200
Maybe. Why do you ask?

789
01:07:28,906 --> 01:07:31,468
It seems that people who could do it

790
01:07:31,577 --> 01:07:34,207
went on to have easy lives.

791
01:07:35,984 --> 01:07:41,221
One girl, completely average
...not even good at math,

792
01:07:41,327 --> 01:07:44,821
always could do it perfect right away.

793
01:07:44,966 --> 01:07:47,904
She grew up really normal

794
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:51,134
and now has two kids.

795
01:07:53,749 --> 01:07:56,618
I was no good at it.

796
01:07:56,954 --> 01:07:59,925
Not smart enough to know when to quit.

797
01:08:04,366 --> 01:08:08,499
<i>Room 5, Taeko Okajima. 25 points</i>

798
01:08:16,521 --> 01:08:19,549
Before the test...

799
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:25,460
...we had art class.

800
01:08:26,938 --> 01:08:30,342
And... um... we did blow pictures.

801
01:08:30,978 --> 01:08:32,105
Blow pictures?

802
01:08:33,116 --> 01:08:37,054
Yes. We drop paint on the paper...

803
01:08:37,657 --> 01:08:41,322
and blow patterns in it.

804
01:08:42,933 --> 01:08:43,831
And?

805
01:08:45,336 --> 01:08:49,241
You blow like this,
really hard, right?

806
01:08:49,844 --> 01:08:51,142
Yes?

807
01:08:51,614 --> 01:08:57,079
So, I got a headache.
From blowing so hard.

808
01:08:57,891 --> 01:08:59,587
That's why you did so badly?

809
01:08:59,694 --> 01:09:02,494
That's right.

810
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:05,195
I see.

811
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,678
Do you know the answers now?

812
01:09:14,419 --> 01:09:16,217
The correct answers?

813
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:18,653
Well...

814
01:09:19,427 --> 01:09:21,795
Have Yaeko help you with them.

815
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:23,592
Yaeko?!

816
01:09:23,769 --> 01:09:25,100
That's right.

817
01:09:26,106 --> 01:09:27,870
Or Nanako, whichever.

818
01:09:31,282 --> 01:09:33,012
I'll ask Nanako.

819
01:09:54,354 --> 01:09:59,022
Nanako's not back yet.
Can I wait til after dinner?

820
01:10:08,244 --> 01:10:10,942
I'll ask Yaeko...

821
01:10:27,778 --> 01:10:29,371
Mother!

822
01:10:30,149 --> 01:10:32,050
Mother! Mother!

823
01:10:33,888 --> 01:10:35,790
What is this?!

824
01:10:36,459 --> 01:10:37,791
How on earth...?

825
01:10:37,895 --> 01:10:41,891
Please teach her.
She doesn't seem to get it.

826
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:47,007
But this is beyond belief!

827
01:10:47,111 --> 01:10:48,773
That's why I'm asking you...

828
01:10:48,881 --> 01:10:50,782
Is she alright in the head?

829
01:10:50,884 --> 01:10:52,911
Just help her.

830
01:10:53,455 --> 01:10:56,051
Normally this is easy.

831
01:10:56,226 --> 01:10:58,092
But that child's not normal!

832
01:11:12,455 --> 01:11:16,918
Taeko, your sister's going to help.

833
01:11:18,398 --> 01:11:22,861
<i>You had a headache from blowing,
didn't you?</i>

834
01:11:26,277 --> 01:11:27,540
Sit.

835
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:34,448
Say your times table from the top.

836
01:11:34,558 --> 01:11:37,758
I know that.
I'm in fif th grade already!

837
01:11:38,432 --> 01:11:41,198
Then why so many mistakes?!

838
01:11:41,303 --> 01:11:43,899
It's dividing fractions.

839
01:11:50,218 --> 01:11:55,023
Just flip the top
and the bottom and multiply.

840
01:11:55,127 --> 01:11:57,597
They taught you that, right?

841
01:11:59,334 --> 01:12:01,360
Then why do you get it wrong?

842
01:12:01,638 --> 01:12:04,769
Yaeko, one step at a time.

843
01:12:09,218 --> 01:12:12,348
What's dividing a fraction
by a fraction anyway?

844
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:23,469
Two-thirds of an apple
divided by a quarter means...

845
01:12:24,043 --> 01:12:27,538
how would this divide

846
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:30,045
between four people, right?

847
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:38,766
So, it's one, two, three,
four, five, six...

848
01:12:38,868 --> 01:12:40,996
one-sixth each, right?

849
01:12:43,142 --> 01:12:45,977
No, no, no, no. That's multiplication.

850
01:12:46,381 --> 01:12:49,751
How come it's less when you multiply?

851
01:12:50,288 --> 01:12:54,159
Two-thirds of an apple
divided by a quarter...

852
01:12:57,967 --> 01:12:58,957
Anyway!

853
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:03,007
Forget about apples...

854
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:07,607
just remember to inverse and multiply.

855
01:13:16,198 --> 01:13:18,293
Is her sister in Takarazuka?

856
01:13:18,403 --> 01:13:19,462
No, S. K. D.

857
01:13:20,506 --> 01:13:23,967
- She got "D" in math.
- "D"?

858
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:27,175
Yes, and just barely.

859
01:13:29,689 --> 01:13:33,218
If she got half right,
it'd be worth scolding her.

860
01:13:33,328 --> 01:13:35,059
Right.

861
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,828
Should you get her IQ checked?

862
01:13:38,937 --> 01:13:41,635
They said it was fine
when she started.

863
01:13:41,742 --> 01:13:43,405
Maybe she turned dumb?

864
01:13:43,512 --> 01:13:46,312
Remember she fell downstairs
as a baby?

865
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:49,149
Right, in her walker!

866
01:13:49,389 --> 01:13:51,290
I thought she was dead.

867
01:13:51,392 --> 01:13:53,328
It was just a bump.

868
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,897
It's affecting her now.

869
01:13:54,998 --> 01:13:56,660
That's it!

870
01:13:57,370 --> 01:14:01,776
<i>Nonsense.
She's just no good at math.</i>

871
01:14:01,877 --> 01:14:04,575
<i>She chats too much in class.</i>

872
01:14:04,715 --> 01:14:09,246
<i>If she'd just listen,;
even an idiot can do it.</i>

873
01:14:09,356 --> 01:14:13,659
<i>It's only two more years
until Junior High.</i>

874
01:14:13,764 --> 01:14:17,498
Two-thirds of this apple,

875
01:14:17,604 --> 01:14:22,704
divided by a quarter...
I can't even picture it.

876
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,081
Two-thirds of this,

877
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:29,953
into a quarter makes it...

878
01:14:35,468 --> 01:14:40,841
Even now, dividing fractions
is difficult.

879
01:14:46,219 --> 01:14:50,784
We farmers give up too easily.

880
01:14:50,994 --> 01:14:56,128
We just yield to the flow and
follow what they do in the cities.

881
01:14:56,236 --> 01:14:59,139
Let's rethink the real
meaning of prosperity.

882
01:14:59,241 --> 01:15:03,237
Return to the old ways of farming.

883
01:15:04,517 --> 01:15:06,110
Wow...

884
01:15:08,023 --> 01:15:11,085
So, that explains the organic farming?

885
01:15:15,002 --> 01:15:18,064
I'm just quoting my friend.

886
01:15:18,608 --> 01:15:21,010
But I agree with it.

887
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:26,685
It's great the way you hold onto
your memories of math class.

888
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:30,123
It wasn't meant to impress you.

889
01:15:30,361 --> 01:15:35,667
People say you work
in a great place

890
01:15:35,937 --> 01:15:38,772
but I could never give myself
up to it completely.

891
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:45,285
I really admire
your devotion to farming.

892
01:15:47,056 --> 01:15:49,424
You re being sarcastic?

893
01:15:49,994 --> 01:15:52,294
Of course not!

894
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:54,926
There aren't many people like you.

895
01:15:59,044 --> 01:16:01,981
Farming's in total decline, right?

896
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:06,649
So we can't just carry on as normal.

897
01:16:06,756 --> 01:16:09,522
We've got to think about the future.

898
01:16:09,728 --> 01:16:14,294
We help each other out,
cheer one another along,

899
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,702
otherwise we can't keep it up.

900
01:16:22,684 --> 01:16:24,243
Taeko do you ski?

901
01:16:24,654 --> 01:16:28,491
I've been with friends a few times.

902
01:16:28,594 --> 01:16:32,658
Come next winter. I'll teach you.

903
01:16:32,768 --> 01:16:34,999
Are you good?

904
01:16:35,305 --> 01:16:39,769
No, but I'm an instructor there.

905
01:16:39,947 --> 01:16:43,146
An instructor? You must be great.

906
01:16:43,386 --> 01:16:46,654
All my friends are too. It's nothing.

907
01:17:09,664 --> 01:17:15,300
At last, we're in the
middle of nowhere.

908
01:17:17,177 --> 01:17:18,236
"Nowhere" huh?

909
01:17:18,345 --> 01:17:21,475
Sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

910
01:17:22,386 --> 01:17:24,412
Interesting point though.

911
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:30,365
City people see the trees and rivers

912
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:33,495
and are grateful for "nature".

913
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:38,980
But what you see here
is all made by man.

914
01:17:39,882 --> 01:17:40,975
By man?

915
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:42,619
Farmers.

916
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,264
- That wood?
- Yes.

917
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:51,698
- Those trees?
- Yes.

918
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:54,130
- That stream?
- Yes.

919
01:17:54,841 --> 01:17:59,144
Every bit has its history,
not just the fields and rice paddies,

920
01:17:59,516 --> 01:18:02,282
someone's Great-Great Grandpa
planted it, or cleared it,

921
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:05,757
gathered firewood
or picked mushrooms there.

922
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:08,159
I see.

923
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:13,666
Mankind battles nature
and receives from it.

924
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:16,767
They evolve together,
and create this scenery.

925
01:18:17,346 --> 01:18:21,445
So without man, this wouldn't exist?

926
01:18:23,056 --> 01:18:27,223
Farmers can't exist without nature.

927
01:18:28,064 --> 01:18:32,471
So they've always taken great care

928
01:18:32,573 --> 01:18:35,601
to give her a helping hand in return.

929
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:41,677
A collaboration between
man and nature...

930
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:44,790
That's the heart of country life.

931
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:49,898
That's why I feel so at home.

932
01:18:50,669 --> 01:18:53,037
I didn't grow up here,
but somehow always felt...

933
01:18:53,174 --> 01:18:57,774
my soul was at home here.

934
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:02,985
So that's it...

935
01:19:51,975 --> 01:19:54,468
My back aches.

936
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:59,285
What's so great about organic farming?

937
01:20:00,522 --> 01:20:05,224
Only the theory. Like I said...

938
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:08,825
giving nature a hand is hard work.

939
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:12,332
Things haven't changed
in a hundred years.

940
01:20:12,643 --> 01:20:17,083
No, even "organic" rice
uses weed-killer.

941
01:20:17,184 --> 01:20:22,090
There's not enough labor
to weed by hand.

942
01:20:24,864 --> 01:20:27,357
You're really working hard.

943
01:20:28,771 --> 01:20:30,603
How about some tea?

944
01:20:31,008 --> 01:20:32,738
Fantastic.

945
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,511
I felt like a break.

946
01:20:43,395 --> 01:20:48,166
<i>Toshio let me try
a variety of things...</i>

947
01:20:49,706 --> 01:20:53,577
<i>...until I felt I knew
all about country life.</i>

948
01:21:22,696 --> 01:21:24,289
That's great...

949
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:47,962
"Behold, the crows fly home.
First one..."

950
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:53,476
At last I can say this
in the right setting.

951
01:21:57,155 --> 01:22:00,285
It was my line in a school play.

952
01:22:00,394 --> 01:22:02,591
I was "Village Child A".

953
01:22:03,265 --> 01:22:05,234
Oh, I see.

954
01:22:05,603 --> 01:22:09,736
I only ever had small roles too.

955
01:22:09,843 --> 01:22:11,072
And you Naoko?

956
01:22:11,179 --> 01:22:16,518
Only lead roles,
since there are so few of us.

957
01:22:16,622 --> 01:22:21,528
These days people leave
and go to the cities.

958
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:26,070
And now there are fewer kids.

959
01:22:26,171 --> 01:22:31,203
I see. But getting the big
roles must be fun.

960
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:37,016
Not really. I prefer sports.
I'm a pretty fast runner.

961
01:22:37,457 --> 01:22:40,987
Good for you.
I was always mediocre.

962
01:22:41,097 --> 01:22:43,499
The sports version
of "Village Child A"

963
01:22:44,235 --> 01:22:48,641
Still, I'll never forget that line
as long as I live.

964
01:22:48,809 --> 01:22:53,307
It was going to make me a star.

965
01:22:53,418 --> 01:22:54,385
A star?

966
01:22:54,486 --> 01:22:55,476
Yes.

967
01:22:55,621 --> 01:22:56,748
What kind of star?

968
01:22:56,857 --> 01:22:58,189
That tiny role?

969
01:22:58,693 --> 01:22:59,683
Yes.

970
01:23:00,363 --> 01:23:02,457
Even though you weren't the lead?

971
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:03,596
Yes.

972
01:23:03,702 --> 01:23:05,967
Because I was the most enthusiastic.

973
01:23:07,709 --> 01:23:09,200
Cause you were the cutest?

974
01:23:09,745 --> 01:23:11,840
No, not that!

975
01:23:12,517 --> 01:23:15,215
I rehearsed endlessly
in front of the mirror.

976
01:23:15,522 --> 01:23:18,618
Even for "Village Child A"...

977
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:24,704
The line was so short,
I felt something missing.

978
01:23:24,971 --> 01:23:29,775
"Behold, the crows fly home.
First one..."

979
01:23:29,879 --> 01:23:32,213
I know. You made up more!

980
01:23:32,651 --> 01:23:34,017
Exactly.

981
01:23:35,824 --> 01:23:41,425
Look up there, the crows fly home.

982
01:23:43,002 --> 01:23:45,164
- First one...
- Then two...

983
01:23:45,272 --> 01:23:47,538
- Then three...
- Then four...

984
01:23:48,979 --> 01:23:52,473
Farewell dear crows.
You take care now.

985
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:58,186
<i>And your teacher loved it.</i>

986
01:23:58,295 --> 01:23:59,091
<i>Just the opposite.</i>

987
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:01,591
Very good everyone.

988
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:07,476
But let's stick to the script.

989
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:21,225
<i>after all that.</i>

990
01:24:21,334 --> 01:24:25,433
<i>It wasn't a good line,
so I didn't mind.</i>

991
01:24:25,842 --> 01:24:29,109
<i>I wasn't discouraged at all.</i>

992
01:24:29,415 --> 01:24:34,446
<i>I realized that I could act
even when there were no lines.</i>

993
01:24:39,432 --> 01:24:42,597
Behold, the crows fly home.

994
01:24:47,613 --> 01:24:49,844
- First one.
- Then two.

995
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:52,182
- Then three.
- Then four.

996
01:25:13,657 --> 01:25:15,353
That was all.

997
01:25:16,395 --> 01:25:21,062
It was worth the effort.
"Village Child A" was a hit.

998
01:25:21,169 --> 01:25:23,332
Believe it or not.

999
01:25:24,008 --> 01:25:30,248
People asked if I'd had lessons.
Teachers praised me...

1000
01:25:30,753 --> 01:25:34,020
Then something amazing happened.

1001
01:25:37,598 --> 01:25:39,032
Anyone home?

1002
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:39,994
Coming.

1003
01:25:40,102 --> 01:25:45,476
<i>...and then the dynamite blew up
right in my face!</i>

1004
01:25:45,579 --> 01:25:47,172
...right in my face!

1005
01:25:47,882 --> 01:25:49,373
What? Our Taeko?

1006
01:25:53,859 --> 01:25:59,095
We need a girl to star
in our college play.

1007
01:26:00,938 --> 01:26:03,807
As a service to the community,

1008
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:06,938
please let your daughter perform.

1009
01:26:07,148 --> 01:26:08,480
A star!

1010
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:12,185
We'd rehearse Saturday afternoons.

1011
01:26:12,558 --> 01:26:15,154
We wouldn't take too long.

1012
01:26:15,262 --> 01:26:18,062
Well, but...

1013
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:21,703
Of course we'd bring her
straight home.

1014
01:26:22,241 --> 01:26:23,971
I'll be in a real play.

1015
01:26:24,077 --> 01:26:28,176
Not with a bunch of kids
but with real grown-ups!

1016
01:26:28,718 --> 01:26:29,913
I'll be a star!

1017
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:39,430
<i>Oh, oh, oh,
oh what a wonderful day</i>

1018
01:26:39,537 --> 01:26:45,810
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>

1019
01:26:59,071 --> 01:27:00,505
Mother!

1020
01:27:01,441 --> 01:27:02,739
So? So?

1021
01:27:02,944 --> 01:27:06,677
A nice boy from the university
wants you in their drama.

1022
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:10,414
You were so good
in the school play.

1023
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:12,258
And? And?

1024
01:27:13,128 --> 01:27:17,431
He practically begged me!

1025
01:27:24,414 --> 01:27:26,713
Wow that's great!

1026
01:27:26,817 --> 01:27:29,083
At least you're good at something.

1027
01:27:29,188 --> 01:27:31,920
She writes good essays too.

1028
01:27:32,026 --> 01:27:36,933
She's certainly better at that
than she is at math.

1029
01:27:37,402 --> 01:27:39,064
That's right. That's right.

1030
01:27:39,172 --> 01:27:44,443
I was lead in "The Poor Sparrow"
but no one came for me.

1031
01:27:44,715 --> 01:27:46,479
You see, you see!

1032
01:27:46,919 --> 01:27:48,785
Are you going to do it?

1033
01:28:12,362 --> 01:28:15,561
This could lead to a career.

1034
01:28:16,837 --> 01:28:18,601
Join the Takarazuka Theater.

1035
01:28:18,706 --> 01:28:22,110
Start rehearsing now,
it's perfect timing.

1036
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:25,282
Acting is out.

1037
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:29,182
Show business people
are no good.

1038
01:28:29,959 --> 01:28:32,828
"Show business"...
don't exaggerate...

1039
01:28:32,930 --> 01:28:35,400
That's right. It's...

1040
01:28:35,501 --> 01:28:36,833
I said no.

1041
01:28:37,739 --> 01:28:38,398
Dinner.

1042
01:28:58,775 --> 01:29:01,301
Father's so stubborn.

1043
01:29:01,546 --> 01:29:05,348
Why did you have to
mention a career?

1044
01:29:05,452 --> 01:29:08,618
- Can I bathe first?
- Sure.

1045
01:29:09,693 --> 01:29:11,424
Or Takarazuka...?

1046
01:29:12,064 --> 01:29:15,594
Or show business?
You know Dad...

1047
01:29:15,804 --> 01:29:20,107
Why did you say that Nanako?

1048
01:29:20,478 --> 01:29:22,242
That's enough.

1049
01:29:26,755 --> 01:29:36,262
<i>Poor boy, poor boy,
Don't you feel sorry for me?</i>

1050
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:39,672
We won't take much of her time.

1051
01:29:39,945 --> 01:29:42,313
I know but...

1052
01:29:43,351 --> 01:29:45,583
I beg you.

1053
01:29:46,924 --> 01:29:50,191
She's rather shy...

1054
01:29:51,198 --> 01:29:54,533
the timid type...

1055
01:29:56,474 --> 01:30:01,141
Sorry you came so far for nothing.

1056
01:30:01,248 --> 01:30:06,451
<i>Poor boy, poor boy...</i>

1057
01:30:06,557 --> 01:30:11,259
<i>.... Such a long way from home...</i>

1058
01:30:11,732 --> 01:30:16,264
<i>Poor boy</i>

1059
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:30,595
Aoki's going to play the part instead.

1060
01:30:31,099 --> 01:30:32,226
I see.

1061
01:30:34,071 --> 01:30:37,407
She's boasting to everyone.

1062
01:30:37,577 --> 01:30:38,544
I see.

1063
01:30:38,645 --> 01:30:41,879
Today her Mom met her at school

1064
01:30:41,984 --> 01:30:46,549
to get her changed into a fancy dress.

1065
01:30:46,792 --> 01:30:49,888
A frilly thing out to here...

1066
01:30:51,434 --> 01:30:57,104
Don't tell anyone
you got the first offer.

1067
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:03,151
Because that would hurt
Aoki very much.

1068
01:31:08,162 --> 01:31:09,255
Do you understand?

1069
01:31:12,604 --> 01:31:13,502
Do you understand?

1070
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:47,357
<i>Breaking through the waves</i>

1071
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:52,429
<i>Shooting through the clouds</i>

1072
01:31:54,474 --> 01:32:00,474
<i>Where is it heading, Hyokkori Pumpkin
Island? Where will it take us?</i>

1073
01:32:05,293 --> 01:32:10,428
<i>Something special waits for us,</i>

1074
01:32:10,536 --> 01:32:15,340
<i>just over the horizon</i>

1075
01:32:15,444 --> 01:32:20,784
<i>There 'll be hard times,
there 'll be sad times,</i>

1076
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:23,320
<i>but we'll never lose heart</i>

1077
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:25,484
<i>We hate to cry,
so let's laugh instead</i>

1078
01:32:25,894 --> 01:32:28,832
<i>Let's go!</i>

1079
01:32:28,934 --> 01:32:34,204
<i>Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!</i>

1080
01:32:52,106 --> 01:32:54,542
Poor you.

1081
01:32:56,948 --> 01:33:00,886
I joined the drama group
in high school.

1082
01:33:01,323 --> 01:33:05,456
I couldn't forget what had happened.

1083
01:33:05,897 --> 01:33:06,795
And then?

1084
01:33:07,566 --> 01:33:10,935
It was a lot of fun, acting and all...

1085
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:17,004
but it wasn't for me.
As for becoming a star...

1086
01:33:17,116 --> 01:33:19,210
that was a joke.

1087
01:33:19,353 --> 01:33:20,719
But...

1088
01:33:22,525 --> 01:33:27,295
I guess Dads are the same all over.

1089
01:33:29,236 --> 01:33:33,369
When I was in high school,
I so wanted to live in Tokyo.

1090
01:33:36,616 --> 01:33:41,318
I even wrote to my cousin
about schools there.

1091
01:33:42,259 --> 01:33:43,989
Did you really?

1092
01:33:45,297 --> 01:33:48,894
I gave up. But it annoyed me

1093
01:33:49,003 --> 01:33:52,703
to hear other guys
bragging about life in Tokyo.

1094
01:33:53,979 --> 01:33:57,850
Not anymore though.
I respect my dad...

1095
01:33:57,952 --> 01:34:00,012
He's an expert farmer.

1096
01:34:02,193 --> 01:34:04,857
But I know how you felt.

1097
01:34:04,964 --> 01:34:07,560
Mine's just a funny story.

1098
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:09,797
No it's the same, I understand.

1099
01:34:13,579 --> 01:34:18,885
But we'll never lose heart, we hate
to cry, so let's laugh instead.

1100
01:34:19,422 --> 01:34:21,550
I also watched
Hyokkori Pumpkin Island.

1101
01:34:21,927 --> 01:34:22,825
Really?

1102
01:34:23,463 --> 01:34:25,432
Machine Gun Dandy was so cool.

1103
01:34:25,532 --> 01:34:27,365
He was my hero!

1104
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:29,998
Of course.

1105
01:34:30,107 --> 01:34:33,670
Those songs were full
of encouragement.

1106
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:36,376
What was that other one...?

1107
01:34:36,485 --> 01:34:40,754
"If today's no good,
you'll have tomorrow"

1108
01:34:41,292 --> 01:34:43,728
"If tomorrow's no good,
you'll have the next day"

1109
01:34:44,131 --> 01:34:46,430
"If that's no good,
there'll be another"

1110
01:34:46,535 --> 01:34:49,165
"There's always a tomorrow"

1111
01:34:52,846 --> 01:34:54,109
What a weird song!

1112
01:34:56,519 --> 01:35:01,756
<i>That song, about putting things off,
Toshio took</i>

1113
01:35:01,861 --> 01:35:05,391
<i>in a positive, affirmative way.</i>

1114
01:35:06,168 --> 01:35:09,800
<i>I liked his approach to life.</i>

1115
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:26,633
You're going tomorrow?

1116
01:35:28,273 --> 01:35:33,373
Thank you for having me for so long.

1117
01:35:33,481 --> 01:35:35,417
Thank you, my dear.

1118
01:35:41,696 --> 01:35:45,226
Do you like it here?

1119
01:35:45,336 --> 01:35:49,742
Very much. I feel so at home.

1120
01:35:49,843 --> 01:35:53,338
Glad to hear it.

1121
01:35:53,783 --> 01:35:56,982
I've lived here all my life.

1122
01:35:57,389 --> 01:36:03,093
Been to Tokyo just once.
For your sister's wedding.

1123
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:06,228
You think it's better than Tokyo?

1124
01:36:06,605 --> 01:36:08,540
Without a doubt.

1125
01:36:08,843 --> 01:36:14,444
Tokyo's packed with cars, buildings...
People shouldn't live like that.

1126
01:36:14,619 --> 01:36:17,852
This is a different world.

1127
01:36:17,958 --> 01:36:22,227
You really like it here then?

1128
01:36:22,332 --> 01:36:26,635
Yes. The nice surroundings,
the kind people...

1129
01:36:30,146 --> 01:36:31,774
Taeko.

1130
01:36:32,616 --> 01:36:36,282
Why don't you live here? With Toshio?

1131
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:45,064
Since his brother moved to Tokyo,

1132
01:36:45,171 --> 01:36:49,874
why don't you stay here
and marry Toshio?

1133
01:36:49,979 --> 01:36:51,277
Granny!

1134
01:36:51,382 --> 01:36:54,683
Mother... you've gone too far!

1135
01:36:54,821 --> 01:36:57,291
Taeko's shocked.

1136
01:36:57,392 --> 01:37:00,761
Please think it over.

1137
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:03,694
Don't pay any attention. She's joking.

1138
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:06,134
Joking, right, Granny?

1139
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:08,904
No. I'm serious.

1140
01:37:09,011 --> 01:37:11,675
Don't deny you wouldn't like it.

1141
01:37:11,783 --> 01:37:16,018
It's not a matter of what we'd like...

1142
01:37:16,124 --> 01:37:18,890
Of course we'd love it.

1143
01:37:18,995 --> 01:37:24,494
But Taeko's a city person.

1144
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:25,630
Of course.

1145
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:29,770
But she loves it here,

1146
01:37:29,881 --> 01:37:34,321
she works so hard on the land,
it's a joy to watch.

1147
01:37:34,488 --> 01:37:38,825
There'd be nothing better
than her marrying Toshio.

1148
01:37:38,929 --> 01:37:42,891
You're being rude.
You're embarrasing her.

1149
01:37:43,571 --> 01:37:48,841
She's got a decent job in Tokyo.
Besides, she's older than him.

1150
01:37:48,947 --> 01:37:52,942
There are jobs in Yamagata too.

1151
01:37:54,422 --> 01:37:57,656
Please don't be angry.

1152
01:37:57,995 --> 01:38:02,492
Most of the young wives
work these days, so...

1153
01:38:02,603 --> 01:38:05,905
What're you talking about?

1154
01:38:06,343 --> 01:38:11,181
She's only been here
twice on holiday.

1155
01:38:11,418 --> 01:38:13,980
Suddenly bringing this up...
you're upsetting her.

1156
01:38:14,089 --> 01:38:16,184
So you're against it?

1157
01:38:16,293 --> 01:38:20,858
I didn't say that.
I said let's be realistic.

1158
01:38:20,968 --> 01:38:25,340
We don't even know
how Toshio feels.

1159
01:38:25,442 --> 01:38:28,414
One look at him and it's obvious.

1160
01:38:28,514 --> 01:38:34,286
Don't dismiss it before
we've asked her.

1161
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:36,585
Taeko!

1162
01:38:42,237 --> 01:38:43,968
Let her be.

1163
01:38:46,478 --> 01:38:50,976
See what you did.
You can't rush these things.

1164
01:38:51,754 --> 01:38:54,782
I don't think I was wrong.

1165
01:39:09,518 --> 01:39:14,049
<i>I'd never even thought
of being a farmer's wife.</i>

1166
01:39:14,994 --> 01:39:18,557
<i>I was strangely moved,</i>

1167
01:39:18,733 --> 01:39:20,794
<i>even imagining it might be possible.</i>

1168
01:39:22,073 --> 01:39:26,206
<i>If only I could've replied:</i>

1169
01:39:26,313 --> 01:39:28,839
<i>"I'd love to... ." like in a movie.</i>

1170
01:39:29,952 --> 01:39:31,511
<i>But I couldn't.</i>

1171
01:39:32,924 --> 01:39:37,227
<i>Suddenly my love of the country,
and my play-farming,</i>

1172
01:39:37,532 --> 01:39:39,660
<i>seemed so phony.</i>

1173
01:39:41,005 --> 01:39:44,774
<i>Declaring my love for country life</i>

1174
01:39:44,878 --> 01:39:48,817
<i>based on a ten day vacation,
now felt so embarrassing.</i>

1175
01:39:50,488 --> 01:39:53,118
<i>Then with no warning....</i>

1176
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,956
<i>everyone seeing right through me.</i>

1177
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:00,299
<i>It was unbearable.</i>

1178
01:40:07,383 --> 01:40:08,908
<i>I ain't shaking hands with you.</i>

1179
01:40:12,024 --> 01:40:14,859
<i>That shirt he wore today....</i>

1180
01:40:14,962 --> 01:40:15,691
<i>What about it?</i>

1181
01:40:15,798 --> 01:40:18,530
<i>Tanaka 's old shirt.</i>

1182
01:40:18,702 --> 01:40:20,000
<i>Don't tell anyone.</i>

1183
01:40:20,105 --> 01:40:25,809
<i>When it's his turn to feed the ducks,
he takes the bread home.</i>

1184
01:40:25,915 --> 01:40:29,284
<i>Did you see his hands?</i>

1185
01:40:29,387 --> 01:40:31,186
<i>Glad he's not sitting next to me.</i>

1186
01:40:31,858 --> 01:40:33,326
<i>Poor Taeko.</i>

1187
01:40:33,427 --> 01:40:35,863
<i>Have him switch places.</i>

1188
01:40:35,965 --> 01:40:39,563
<i>He should sit with the boys.</i>

1189
01:40:39,672 --> 01:40:41,231
<i>Right Taeko?</i>

1190
01:40:42,109 --> 01:40:45,206
I don't mind.

1191
01:40:45,448 --> 01:40:47,679
You shouldn't talk like that.

1192
01:40:47,952 --> 01:40:49,512
You don't mind?

1193
01:40:49,622 --> 01:40:51,250
Don't be a goody-goody.

1194
01:40:51,725 --> 01:40:54,696
Don't you dare tell anyone
what we said.

1195
01:40:59,439 --> 01:41:01,032
I'll beat you up!

1196
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:09,683
Don't go!

1197
01:41:22,611 --> 01:41:24,341
What are you doing out here?

1198
01:41:25,049 --> 01:41:28,179
Nothing. Taking a walk.

1199
01:41:28,288 --> 01:41:32,819
You're getting wet. Quick, get in.

1200
01:41:49,290 --> 01:41:51,020
A little souvenir.

1201
01:41:51,962 --> 01:41:53,521
Some of Mom's pickles.

1202
01:42:00,409 --> 01:42:02,674
Please don't go back yet.

1203
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:04,111
Why not?

1204
01:42:04,216 --> 01:42:07,415
Just drive... anywhere.

1205
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:09,423
Something wrong?

1206
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:14,800
I knew a boy named Abe.

1207
01:42:16,403 --> 01:42:20,638
He came from another school.
He sat next to me.

1208
01:42:22,313 --> 01:42:24,044
He once said,

1209
01:42:25,051 --> 01:42:27,578
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

1210
01:42:52,632 --> 01:42:58,541
His family was poor.
He never had sports gear.

1211
01:42:59,444 --> 01:43:04,111
Always picking his nose
or wiping it on his sleeve...

1212
01:43:04,218 --> 01:43:10,058
And if I complained or
even dared frown at him,

1213
01:43:10,161 --> 01:43:13,531
he'd threaten to hit me.

1214
01:43:15,170 --> 01:43:20,270
I hated it. I longed for
the end of the term,

1215
01:43:20,546 --> 01:43:22,572
so we could change seats.

1216
01:43:24,152 --> 01:43:28,524
I hated holding hands
in dance class,

1217
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:33,464
hated having to lend him
my homework.

1218
01:43:36,073 --> 01:43:41,343
The girls gossiped
and called him names.

1219
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:47,157
But I wouldn't join in.

1220
01:43:47,626 --> 01:43:52,430
I thought it was terrible
to talk behind his back.

1221
01:43:54,438 --> 01:43:55,496
But one day...

1222
01:43:56,441 --> 01:44:01,006
He was transferred in
the middle of the term.

1223
01:44:02,050 --> 01:44:06,752
The teacher made us all
shake hands and say goodbye.

1224
01:44:08,295 --> 01:44:11,528
A feeling of disgust swept the room.

1225
01:44:14,071 --> 01:44:18,204
His hands were filthy.

1226
01:44:20,181 --> 01:44:25,521
Walking around,
shaking hands with us,

1227
01:44:25,924 --> 01:44:27,984
he looked so nervous.

1228
01:44:30,699 --> 01:44:35,470
Back at his own desk,
only I was left.

1229
01:44:38,246 --> 01:44:43,209
When I held out my hand he said,

1230
01:44:45,057 --> 01:44:47,083
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

1231
01:44:50,199 --> 01:44:52,601
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

1232
01:45:00,817 --> 01:45:04,482
I hated him the most.

1233
01:45:06,494 --> 01:45:09,761
He knew that.

1234
01:45:11,068 --> 01:45:13,436
That's why he didn't shake my hand.

1235
01:45:20,985 --> 01:45:23,114
What happened at the farmhouse?

1236
01:45:23,790 --> 01:45:28,492
Ever since I was little...

1237
01:45:30,435 --> 01:45:32,529
I just pretend to be nice.

1238
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:35,008
Nothing's changed.

1239
01:45:46,128 --> 01:45:49,725
You're strange, today.
Not the usual you.

1240
01:45:52,572 --> 01:45:54,872
I don't know what happened, but...

1241
01:45:55,043 --> 01:45:58,880
It's nothing to do with that.

1242
01:46:03,090 --> 01:46:04,558
I'm sorry.

1243
01:46:05,962 --> 01:46:11,131
I just feel bad about what happened.

1244
01:46:13,675 --> 01:46:17,978
I think that boy was stupid.

1245
01:46:18,316 --> 01:46:23,154
Maybe he didn't shake your hand
because he liked you.

1246
01:46:23,258 --> 01:46:27,823
No, he liked the class president.

1247
01:46:27,966 --> 01:46:29,935
He was always acting tough with me.

1248
01:46:30,036 --> 01:46:38,074
Hands in pockets, spitting,
swearing, swaggering along,

1249
01:46:38,584 --> 01:46:40,416
...showing off.

1250
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:42,046
Exactly.

1251
01:46:42,324 --> 01:46:45,887
I know how he feels.
When I was little,

1252
01:46:45,996 --> 01:46:48,660
I used to bully the girl I liked.

1253
01:46:48,768 --> 01:46:50,567
That's not it.

1254
01:46:50,672 --> 01:46:55,112
He shook hands with everyone but me.

1255
01:46:55,613 --> 01:46:58,448
There's the problem.

1256
01:46:59,353 --> 01:47:02,119
Girls never understand how boys feel.

1257
01:47:02,859 --> 01:47:04,761
As if you know...

1258
01:47:05,196 --> 01:47:07,393
Let me guess, then...

1259
01:47:08,201 --> 01:47:11,536
He wasn't that tough.

1260
01:47:12,075 --> 01:47:17,449
He couldn't bully any boys.
He had no friends.

1261
01:47:20,156 --> 01:47:25,028
You sat next to him, an easy target.

1262
01:47:25,664 --> 01:47:28,659
He needed you to be tough with.

1263
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:32,708
No way he wanted
to shake hands with everyone.

1264
01:47:32,811 --> 01:47:38,218
He could only prove how
tough he was with you.

1265
01:48:03,729 --> 01:48:05,756
Don't be filthy!

1266
01:48:50,142 --> 01:48:54,947
I felt so guilty and so sorry for him

1267
01:48:55,685 --> 01:48:57,985
that I began copying him.

1268
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:02,061
Too late though, huh?

1269
01:49:02,263 --> 01:49:05,200
I couldn't take back

1270
01:49:05,368 --> 01:49:08,271
the pain I caused him.

1271
01:49:17,088 --> 01:49:20,083
It's stopped raining.

1272
01:49:20,728 --> 01:49:22,356
Oh, yes.

1273
01:49:27,139 --> 01:49:28,732
The moon's out.

1274
01:49:39,092 --> 01:49:42,963
Sometimes at night
you see raccoons here.

1275
01:49:45,236 --> 01:49:46,465
Shall we go back?

1276
01:49:46,571 --> 01:49:50,670
They must be worried about me.

1277
01:49:53,851 --> 01:49:57,448
This'll be the talk of the town.

1278
01:49:57,924 --> 01:50:01,488
I'm sorry. You've been so kind.

1279
01:50:02,332 --> 01:50:05,063
I wonder what happened
at the house, though?

1280
01:50:05,171 --> 01:50:09,975
Please, for my sake,
don't ask anyone.

1281
01:50:13,685 --> 01:50:15,916
Shall I play that music?

1282
01:50:54,688 --> 01:50:58,182
<i>I began to think of
my feelings for him,</i>

1283
01:50:58,661 --> 01:51:03,967
<i>and of his feelings for me,
for the very first time.</i>

1284
01:51:07,944 --> 01:51:14,218
<i>How come he seemed to sort out
my mixed-up thoughts?</i>

1285
01:51:14,956 --> 01:51:19,521
<i>How come I let him get so close?</i>

1286
01:51:21,066 --> 01:51:25,130
<i>Somehow he seemed older than me.</i>

1287
01:51:26,375 --> 01:51:32,546
<i>He was the one I wanted
to shake hands with.</i>

1288
01:51:35,257 --> 01:51:36,851
<i>Just shake hands?</i>

1289
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:11,117
<i>What was this feeling?</i>

1290
01:52:12,488 --> 01:52:16,928
<i>My mind raced as I sat beside him.</i>

1291
01:52:43,941 --> 01:52:46,002
Have you got everything?

1292
01:52:46,112 --> 01:52:47,842
Yes, I'm fine.

1293
01:52:48,048 --> 01:52:50,245
We'll see you in the winter.

1294
01:52:50,353 --> 01:52:54,223
I'll do my farming homework.

1295
01:52:54,325 --> 01:52:56,591
What about skiing?

1296
01:52:56,996 --> 01:52:59,364
That just takes practice.

1297
01:52:59,901 --> 01:53:03,101
Consider what I said, Taeko.

1298
01:53:03,375 --> 01:53:04,673
What's that?

1299
01:53:04,777 --> 01:53:05,505
What?

1300
01:53:05,912 --> 01:53:09,714
That's our secret.

1301
01:53:10,353 --> 01:53:13,654
Something was strange yesterday.

1302
01:53:13,759 --> 01:53:17,163
Sorry. Next time I'll be fine,

1303
01:53:17,265 --> 01:53:20,065
I'll leave the ten year-old me,
at home.

1304
01:53:33,426 --> 01:53:35,122
Wait for me!

1305
01:53:36,364 --> 01:53:38,197
Take care Naoko.

1306
01:53:47,516 --> 01:53:48,882
Goodbye.

1307
01:54:29,188 --> 01:54:36,725
<i>Some say love, it is a river</i>

1308
01:54:37,602 --> 01:54:43,169
<i>that drowns the tender reed.</i>

1309
01:54:44,948 --> 01:54:51,586
<i>Some say love, it is a razor</i>

1310
01:54:53,529 --> 01:54:59,597
<i>that leaves your soul to bleed.</i>

1311
01:55:01,008 --> 01:55:07,612
<i>Some say love, it is a hunger,</i>

1312
01:55:09,456 --> 01:55:15,627
<i>an endless aching need.</i>

1313
01:55:17,136 --> 01:55:24,570
<i>I say love, it is a flower,</i>

1314
01:55:25,818 --> 01:55:32,250
<i>and you its only seed.</i>

1315
01:55:37,237 --> 01:55:44,205
<i>It's the heart, afraid of breaking,</i>

1316
01:55:45,451 --> 01:55:51,690
<i>that never learns to dance.</i>

1317
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:59,464
<i>It's the dream, afraid of waking,</i>

1318
01:56:00,476 --> 01:56:07,011
<i>that never takes a chance.</i>

1319
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:14,858
<i>It's the one who won't be taken.</i>

1320
01:56:16,071 --> 01:56:23,038
<i>Who cannot seem to give.</i>

1321
01:56:24,117 --> 01:56:31,358
<i>And the soul, afraid of dyin',</i>

1322
01:56:32,665 --> 01:56:39,838
<i>that never learns to live.</i>

1323
01:56:43,817 --> 01:56:50,785
<i>When the night has been too Ionely</i>

1324
01:56:52,098 --> 01:56:57,870
<i>and the road has been too long,</i>

1325
01:56:59,377 --> 01:57:06,151
<i>And you think that love is only</i>

1326
01:57:07,324 --> 01:57:14,064
<i>for the lucky and the strong,</i>

1327
01:57:14,637 --> 01:57:22,812
<i>Just remember in the winter</i>

1328
01:57:22,918 --> 01:57:29,453
<i>far beneath the bitter snows.</i>

1329
01:57:30,965 --> 01:57:38,604
<i>Lies the seed,
that with the sun's love,</i>

1330
01:57:39,947 --> 01:57:48,053
<i>in the Spring becomes the Rose.</i>
