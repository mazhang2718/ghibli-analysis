12
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:38,228
The pot is bubbling,
The rice is steaming

13
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:41,481
<i>The cutting board is standing by</i>

14
00:01:42,107 --> 00:01:45,610
<i>The tofu is jiggly,
The eggs are slippery</i>

15
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:49,614
<i>The natto is sticky as can be</i>

16
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:53,576

20
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:08,675
<i>Time to wake up the house</i>

21
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:12,512
<i>Get everyone to the table</i>

22
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:16,474
<i>Now dig in, eat hearty</i>

23
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:20,019

24
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,690
<i>Another beautiful breakfast together</i>

25
00:02:23,982 --> 00:02:27,610
<i>And I made it all for you</i>

26
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:31,447
<i>Hurry up, dig in now</i>

27
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:35,201
<i>But be sure to taste every bite</i>

28
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:39,038

<i>But be sure to taste every bite</i>

32
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:12,979
Morning!

33
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:15,867
Good morning.
Is Sora up yet?

34
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:17,911
Still in front of the mirror.

35
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:20,288
Morning.

36
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:25,752
Night shift again?

37
00:03:26,294 --> 00:03:27,921
And tonight too.

38
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:30,882
Shall I save dinner for you?

39
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:32,884
Yes, thanks.

40
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:35,178
That's real service.

41
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:39,098
- The hospital's short-handed.
- I got a hole in my sock!

42
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:41,267
Leave it by the sewing machine.

43
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:42,936
More holes?

44
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:45,438
My socks keep shrinking.

45
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,190
This is for you.

46
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:50,109
Pack me a jumbo lunch.

47
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:52,737
Don't you eat enough already?

48
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:56,574
- Here Riku, have my fried egg.
- All right!

49
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:59,535
You need it more, Dr. Hokuto.

50
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,956
Who's the doctor here?

51
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,752
You drown everything in soy sauce.

52
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,004
- I like it that way.
- Me too.

53
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:16,135
Breakfast is ready, Hiro.

54
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:19,806
Good morning, Hana.

55
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:21,432
Good morning.

56
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:29,732
You can share your mother's.

57
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:31,141
Thanks.

58
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:33,778
Can I make you some tea?

59
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:35,989
No thanks, I've had some.

60
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:40,910
Good morning.

61
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:46,406
Thanks.

62
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,340
Please go ahead, everyone.

63
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:56,009
Let's eat!

64
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,670
You're late.

65
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,516
I can't get my hair right.

66
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:06,519
You look very pretty.

67
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,139
I'm starving.

68
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:13,943
Evening rounds again, Dr. Hokuto?

69
00:06:14,212 --> 00:06:15,421
See you tomorrow.

70
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:16,788
Bye.

71
00:06:40,863 --> 00:06:42,365
Good morning, Tomoko.

72
00:06:44,242 --> 00:06:45,576
Need a lift?

73
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,621
- Thanks, I'll walk.
- Suit yourself.

74
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:53,292
- Can you hang the laundry?
- Of course. See you this afternoon.

75
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:54,919
Bye, then.

76
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:16,149
KONAN ACADEMY

77
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:19,184
There she is.

78
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:22,321
Look what's in the school paper.

79
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:26,075
There's a poem about you.
Who else raises flags every morning?

80
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:30,246
'Fair girl, why do you send
Your thoughts to the sky?'

81
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,416
'The wind carries them aloft
To mingle with the crows. '

82
00:07:33,624 --> 00:07:36,627
'Trimmed with blue,
Your flags fly again today. '

83
00:07:36,794 --> 00:07:38,754
See? It must be about you.

84
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:40,130
I guess.

85
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:42,425
So it's about you.

86
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:45,344
Try a note
in a bottle next time.

87
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:48,514
Back off Math Club creep!

88
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:51,225
He practically lives
at the clubhouse.

89
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:54,520
All rise!

90
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:03,154
- We grabbed a table.
- See you there.

91
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,369
Nobuko, over here!

92
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:13,873
- I'm famished.
- What, curry udon again?

93
00:08:14,248 --> 00:08:18,211
Why not? I like it.
Anyway, you're one to talk.

94
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:19,879
So? I like bread.

95
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:22,048
Umi's lunches look so good.

96
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,383
You should try making your own.

97
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,221
I could, I just don't
have enough time.

98
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:34,060
What are those guys
up to now?

99
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,417
All right, drop the banners.

100
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:01,921
LATIN QUARTER
ANTI-DEMOLITION LEAGUE

101
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:04,423
Go.

102
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:39,333
Go for it!

103
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,130
Look this way, you guys.

104
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:51,470
That was cool.

105
00:09:52,388 --> 00:09:53,598
Are you okay?

106
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:55,965
So stupid...

107
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:04,650
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

108
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:08,237
- Thanks, Tomoko.
- My pleasure.

109
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:12,992
That should do it.

110
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:15,494
Today's fish was really cheap.

111
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,956
Thanks. I think I'll deep fry it.

112
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:21,959
I have to see Grandmother.

113
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:31,260
Grandmother? It's me.

114
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:32,928
Come in.

115
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:49,195
In the black again this month.
You're managing things beautifully.

116
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:54,075
Only because you're covering
Tomoko's wages for us.

117
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:55,618
It's nothing.

118
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:59,830
I'd have hired her anyway,
even without the boarders.

119
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:02,875
But isn't this
too much work for you?

120
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:06,712
I worry sometimes.

121
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:11,050
It doesn't feel so lonely
with everyone here.

122
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:13,177
I know. But still...

123
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:18,224
It makes me so sad, watching you
raise those flags every day.

124
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:22,520
No one knows how much
you miss your father.

125
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:25,481
I hope you find
someone wonderful soon.

126
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:28,526
Then you won't need
those flags anymore.

127
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:33,030
- Mrs. Matsuzaki?
- Come in.

128
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:36,701
I'm finished for the day.

129
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:38,536
Thank you, Tomoko.

130
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:43,541
I should get dinner going.

131
00:12:50,357 --> 00:12:52,485
That was quite a stunt.

132
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:54,195
No kidding.

133
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:58,657
Some of the girls
are even starting a fan club.

134
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:00,326
What's his name?

135
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:03,287
Shun Kazama.
He's a live wire.

136
00:13:03,454 --> 00:13:06,707
- The electrician's son?
- Hiro, you're so dense.

137
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:37,446
'Fair girl, why do you send
Your thoughts to the sky?'

138
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,049
Thus the Principality of Wallachia
was hemmed in...

139
00:13:57,216 --> 00:14:02,888
by the Ottoman Turks and Russia,
and its territory was coveted by both.

140
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:09,728
SAVE OUR CLUBHOUSE
FROM DEMOLITION

141
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:15,733
Umi!

142
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:17,486
Sora? What's going on?

143
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:22,032
I bought this for 30 yen.

144
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:26,745
30 yen just for that?

145
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:30,207
Isn't he cool?
I've got to have his autograph.

146
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:34,587
Please come with me.
I've never been inside the clubhouse.

147
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:37,089
Neither have I.
I'm not going in there.

148
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:39,049
- Please!
- No way.

149
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:44,263
Come on, just this once.

150
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:45,755
Come on...

151
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:52,938
DON'T DEMOLISH OUR CLUBHOUSE

152
00:15:03,908 --> 00:15:05,108
Read)/-7

153
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:13,374
Excuse me?

154
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:17,963
- Today's spots are very distinct!
- And they form a straight line.

155
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:20,341
A textbook magnetic field.

156
00:15:20,507 --> 00:15:21,707
Excuse me.

157
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:22,759
What?

158
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,638
We're looking for the
school newspaper office.

159
00:15:25,804 --> 00:15:28,641
Third floor, same room
as the Archaeology Club.

160
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:30,258
Thanks.

161
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:49,286
Don't they ever clean this place?

162
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:11,517
Hey.

163
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:14,478
Hi, we're looking for the
Archaeology Club.

164
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:18,023
Upstairs.
Look for the Lit Club sign.

165
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:19,525
Thanks.

166
00:16:31,286 --> 00:16:32,830
At last, inquiring minds!

167
00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:35,541
The Philosophy Club wants you.

168
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:40,045
New members!
How long has it been?

169
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:42,923
My struggle was not in vain.

170
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:47,845
We're just heading for the
Archaeology Lit Club, actually.

171
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:51,890
Now don't be shy.
Shall we discuss existentialism?

172
00:16:52,182 --> 00:16:54,560
Or perhaps you prefer Nietzsche?

173
00:16:58,063 --> 00:17:00,899
Chem Club! How dare you
disturb our contemplation?

174
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:04,778
Better run, you guys.
You'll be there all day.

175
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:08,282
Show some respect,
you second-rate alchemists.

176
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:12,244
At least we do experiments.
Your ideas can't even be proved.

177
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:17,875
'New poets! Draw energy
from clouds, light, storms... '

178
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,211
'Show us the direction
humanity should take... '

179
00:17:21,462 --> 00:17:24,757
'A Copernicus for a new age,
to set us free... '

180
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:27,176
CQ! CQ!

181
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,762
This is a high school student
from Japan.

182
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:57,164
LITERATURE CLUB
LATIN QUARTER WEEKLY

183
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:58,656
This is it.

184
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:03,628
Matsuzaki.

185
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:04,963
Yamazaki...

186
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:08,133
Hey,Shun!
Couple of VIPs to see you.

187
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:17,559
Welcome to the Lit Club.
Or was it the Archaeology Club?

188
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:22,022
Don't tell me you're here
about that rag we publish.

189
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:25,234
Knock it off, Mizunuma.
Come in and close the...

190
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:31,406
They'll shut us down!

191
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:36,036
We're down to two members.
The Archaeology Club is doomed.

192
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:42,668
Can you sign this?

193
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:45,337
Do it for her, hero.

194
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:57,516
Thank you!

195
00:18:57,766 --> 00:18:58,966
Your hand...

196
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:03,522
Just a cat scratch.
This isn't from the jump.

197
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:06,275
A cat...?

198
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,362
Wait, could you cut
some stencils for Shun?

199
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:15,450
We're all pretty busy
with the anti-demolition campaign.

200
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:16,994
You're the little sister?

201
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:19,371
Yes, I'm Sora Matsuzaki.

202
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:23,208
You help them, Umi.
My handwriting is terrible.

203
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,295
You're joking. Why should I...

204
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:28,338
PHYSICS MIDTERM FORECAST!

205
00:19:28,714 --> 00:19:31,383
You're a junior.
Got Suzuki for physics?

206
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:34,126
Suzuki? Yes.

207
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:35,971
Then you need this.

208
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,850
Mizunuma's exam forecasts
are usually spot on.

209
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:43,937
But not guaranteed.
Bring your own luck to the test.

210
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:47,983
See you at six.

211
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:50,527
Shall we go?

212
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:52,144
Oh, yes!

213
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:59,578
Miss Matsuzaki,
I'd better see you out.

214
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:02,039
Our resident philosopher
might ambush you.

215
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:03,749
Oh, thank you!

216
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,770
From here to the end.

217
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:40,410
We've got to do something.

218
00:20:40,661 --> 00:20:44,039
Yes, for the honor of those
who went before us!

219
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:30,794
Meeting, Shun.

220
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:35,173
Care to join us, Matsuzaki?
It's the anti-demolition meeting.

221
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:37,092
Is it that late?

222
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:38,459
I finished.

223
00:21:38,802 --> 00:21:41,096
Thanks, that really helps.

224
00:21:42,306 --> 00:21:44,016
Meeting!

225
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:49,730
All hands on deck.
Time for today's meeting.

226
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,005
<i>I'm home. </i>

227
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,650
Hi, Umi.

228
00:22:44,743 --> 00:22:48,455
I'm running late. Let's do curry.
Can you cut the vegetables?

229
00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:50,082
Sure.

230
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:10,852
- I'm back.
- We were waiting.

231
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:14,898
Riku, I need some pork.
Can you run down for me?

232
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:17,401
What, right now?

233
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:19,602
Sora?

234
00:23:20,153 --> 00:23:22,614
But the program just started.

235
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,409
You didn't ask Tomoko
to get some?

236
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:28,078
I used it for lunches.

237
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:37,254
Start the rice
in 10 minutes, okay?

238
00:23:38,713 --> 00:23:40,298
Okay.

239
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:55,137
Shopping?

240
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:56,472
Sort of.

241
00:23:58,275 --> 00:24:00,819
Hop on.
Bottom of the hill, right?

242
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:05,657
Don't worry, my hand's okay.
I can use the brake just fine.

243
00:24:21,506 --> 00:24:23,258
How was your meeting?

244
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:25,177
Still going strong.

245
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,804
But I've got curfew.

246
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,851
Did you finish printing the paper?

247
00:24:33,143 --> 00:24:37,189
You must be kidding.
I'll do it tomorrow before school.

248
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:43,695
Listen, Shun.
Can I ask you something?

249
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:47,741
That poem in the paper...

250
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:59,085
- You were saying?
- No, it's okay.

251
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:12,881
Thanks.

252
00:25:15,477 --> 00:25:17,729
400 grams of sliced pork.

253
00:25:18,522 --> 00:25:19,731
Two to go.

254
00:25:20,315 --> 00:25:23,401
- Here you go. 240 yen.
- Thanks.

255
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,740
Come again.

256
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:31,233
Thanks.

257
00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:33,235
Dig in.

258
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:37,749
I need energy to get home.

259
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,918
Where's your house?

260
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,754
- By the harbor.
- Gosh, that's far.

261
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:47,541
See you.

262
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:50,762
Thank you!

263
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:03,650
This is nice.

264
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:26,464
Can I come in?

265
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:30,343
Don't you feel well?

266
00:26:35,265 --> 00:26:36,725
Go on ahead, Sora.

267
00:26:37,434 --> 00:26:38,810
I'm coming in.

268
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:52,741
Wow...

269
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:06,171
I shouldn't paint at night.
The colors are all wrong.

270
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:09,007
It's beautiful.

271
00:27:10,634 --> 00:27:11,834
What's this?

272
00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:19,517
That tug goes by a lot.
I think it's answering your flags.

273
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,021
Guess you can't see
the tug from there.

274
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,025
Answering my message?

275
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:37,035
I need food.

276
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,048
Good morning.

277
00:28:01,518 --> 00:28:03,728
All printed up.
Your handwriting's great.

278
00:28:04,854 --> 00:28:06,231
Thanks.

279
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:08,900
Listen...

280
00:28:14,197 --> 00:28:16,408
Can I help with anything else?

281
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:18,066
Of course.

282
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:22,831
But I can't stay late.

283
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:27,252
I'll give you some stencils.
You can transfer copy at home.

284
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:33,216
There's a debate after school.
Why don't you come?

285
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:36,177
Sorry, I'm busy today.

286
00:28:37,303 --> 00:28:38,513
Bye.

287
00:28:45,562 --> 00:28:46,762
Umi, wait!

288
00:28:47,063 --> 00:28:48,263
Let's get ice cream.

289
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:49,607
No club meeting?

290
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:52,402
It was canceled for the debate.

291
00:28:52,652 --> 00:28:56,114
Sorry, Tomoko's off today.
I have to be back early.

292
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,284
Come on everybody,
the debate's starting.

293
00:28:59,617 --> 00:29:03,621
RESOLVED: THE LATIN QUARTER
SHOULD BE PRESERVED!

294
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:05,874
Good, hold it right there.

295
00:29:08,543 --> 00:29:09,961
This'll get rough.

296
00:29:14,674 --> 00:29:18,887
Afternoon. Heading home?
Got some nice flounder fillets.

297
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:20,972
Okay, I'll take some.

298
00:29:22,432 --> 00:29:25,810
- Your mom back yet?
- Not yet.

299
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:27,645
I'll come back later!

300
00:29:27,854 --> 00:29:29,054
What's going on?

301
00:29:34,527 --> 00:29:39,324
We've had peace for nearly 20 years.
The Olympics are coming soon.

302
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:45,330
It's a whole new era.
Japan is changing radically.

303
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:50,168
We must build a new society
on the ruins of the old.

304
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:54,172
Tearing down the Latin Quarter...

305
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:57,801
and building a new clubhouse
is a historical necessity.

306
00:29:58,176 --> 00:29:59,761
And the students want it.

307
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:01,169
Umi!

308
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:02,713
What's happening?

309
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:04,599
I don't know exactly.

310
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,270
We surveyed the students
about the new clubhouse.

311
00:30:09,437 --> 00:30:13,858
80 percent of the student body
want to rebuild.

312
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:17,946
I believe we must accept
the board's plan!

313
00:30:21,324 --> 00:30:23,701
You're like the old men
who run this country...

314
00:30:23,993 --> 00:30:26,663
just blindly following the crowd.

315
00:30:27,163 --> 00:30:29,165
Silence! I have the floor.

316
00:30:29,582 --> 00:30:33,878
Who cares about percentages
when you're wrong? Blockheads!

317
00:30:34,462 --> 00:30:35,964
Wait your turn!

318
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:40,844
Is this the tyranny of the majority?

319
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:43,721
You can't grasp
the meaning of democracy.

320
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:55,233
Want to demolish something?
Demolish your own heads.

321
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,901
I have the floor!

322
00:30:57,026 --> 00:31:01,114
Destroy the old and you
destroy our memory of the past.

323
00:31:01,364 --> 00:31:05,410
Don't you care about the people
who lived and died before us?

324
00:31:05,618 --> 00:31:07,412
There's no future for people...

325
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:11,040
who worship the future
and forget the past.

326
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:15,253
Democracy doesn't mean
you can ignore the minority.

327
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,672
Throw the anarchists out!

328
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:20,591
Scrum!

329
00:31:20,592 --> 00:31:22,093
Eject them!

330
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:25,471
Stand fast, men!

331
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:27,932
Get off the stage. You're history!

332
00:31:49,078 --> 00:31:54,292
<i>A white flower was blooming</i>

333
00:31:54,667 --> 00:32:00,567
<i>That day long ago,
in my homeland far away</i>

334
00:32:02,592 --> 00:32:07,472
<i>When at last we parted</i>

335
00:32:08,097 --> 00:32:13,353
<i>You looked away
And didn't say a word</i>

336
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,982
<i>I remember your long braids</i>

337
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:23,613
<i>And the sadness in my heart</i>

338
00:32:23,905 --> 00:32:28,826
<i>As that white flower bloomed</i>

339
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:34,374
<i>And the sadness in my heart</i>

340
00:32:34,624 --> 00:32:40,338
<i>As that white flower bloomed</i>

341
00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:47,011
So what did you think?

342
00:32:47,136 --> 00:32:50,515
It was amazing.
Everybody's so passionate.

343
00:32:50,807 --> 00:32:52,475
Debates are always like that.

344
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:55,353
Most everyone thinks
the clubhouse should go.

345
00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:57,522
Mizunuma's fighting a losing battle.

346
00:32:58,022 --> 00:32:59,440
You think?

347
00:33:12,787 --> 00:33:15,415
Maybe you could
clean the place up.

348
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,544
It's old, but
it's such a nice building.

349
00:33:19,836 --> 00:33:24,632
Make it like new again.
Invite the girls to come see it.

350
00:33:25,174 --> 00:33:28,136
- Then they'll get it.
- Maybe you're right.

351
00:33:28,678 --> 00:33:32,223
But the guys think
all that dust is part of history.

352
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:35,351
The physics midterm forecast
was a big hit.

353
00:33:35,768 --> 00:33:38,396
Everybody's waiting
for the math forecast.

354
00:33:38,771 --> 00:33:40,023
Me too.

355
00:33:47,989 --> 00:33:50,158
Thanks. You've been a big help.

356
00:33:51,492 --> 00:33:53,494
- See you soon.
- So long.

357
00:33:58,291 --> 00:33:59,584
Umi! Thanks.

358
00:34:09,886 --> 00:34:11,846
Oh no... the fish!

359
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:20,605
...then everyone started singing.
The teachers were totally fooled.

360
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:29,781
It sounds like nothing's changed
since I graduated.

361
00:34:29,947 --> 00:34:33,785
Your president Mizunuma
is my classmate's little brother.

362
00:34:34,494 --> 00:34:39,457
- Was his brother a genius too?
- Sister. She's an astrophysicist.

363
00:34:39,749 --> 00:34:40,665
Wow...

364
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:43,294
What's all the excitement in here?

365
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:45,963
- Great idea.
- This is the best.

366
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:47,632
I'll slice some cheese.

367
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:50,009
- Can I taste it?
- Sorry, too young.

368
00:34:50,384 --> 00:34:53,471
Umi, why don't we invite
some Konan graduates...

369
00:34:53,638 --> 00:34:55,181
to my farewell party?

370
00:34:56,015 --> 00:34:57,215
Who?

371
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,977
You know... the guys.

372
00:35:01,938 --> 00:35:03,314
Guys?

373
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:25,920
Hey.

374
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:32,093
H-O-K-U-T...

375
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:33,626
Hokuto.

376
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:36,472
You read signal flags?

377
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:43,604
The gate's open.

378
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,930
Coming.

379
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:02,623
Why not get married
and start a practice right here?

380
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:04,542
We'd have to move out!

381
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:06,711
You'll be married by then.

382
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:08,629
I'd better start looking.

383
00:36:08,754 --> 00:36:11,257
Bet you find
a real nice guy.

384
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:12,717
You're the best.

385
00:36:13,134 --> 00:36:17,054
- The trustees are the problem.
- The principal's a good guy.

386
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:20,725
- He goes where the wind blows.
- The chairman's an old fox.

387
00:36:21,058 --> 00:36:24,812
When's the principal going to quit?

388
00:36:25,062 --> 00:36:28,733
I think we can handle them,
but we need a strategy.

389
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,905
Even with a strategy,
what can we actually do?

390
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:36,490
We need more glasses.

391
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:39,660
I'll wash some.
Here, take this out.

392
00:36:43,998 --> 00:36:46,000
The sushi's here.

393
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:47,951
Finally!

394
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:52,924
This building is 60 years old.
It used to be a hospital.

395
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:04,936
My great-grandfather loved cats.

396
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:10,441
Compared to the clubhouse,
it looks like it was built yesterday.

397
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,736
You really take good care of it.

398
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:18,741
So I guess your dad
must've been a doctor too?

399
00:37:18,908 --> 00:37:21,577
No, he was a ship captain.

400
00:37:24,455 --> 00:37:28,751
<i>From this Valley
They say you are going</i>

401
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:33,673
<i>We will miss your bright eyes
And sweet smile</i>

402
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,801
<i>For they say
You are faking the sunshine</i>

403
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:39,762
So your mom married a sailor.

404
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:43,057
Grandma and Grandpa
were totally against it.

405
00:37:43,224 --> 00:37:44,809
They tried to stop her.

406
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:48,980
So Mom ran away and they eloped.

407
00:37:49,105 --> 00:37:52,984
I bet that took guts.
I heard your mom's a professor.

408
00:37:55,444 --> 00:37:58,322
And the signal flags...
Your dad taught you?

409
00:38:03,953 --> 00:38:06,789
Yes, when I was little.

410
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:15,965
He said they helped him
find his way back to us.

411
00:38:16,173 --> 00:38:18,301
So I raised them every day.

412
00:38:20,094 --> 00:38:24,974
I'd raise them from the balcony
until his ship docked again.

413
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:28,227
I never missed a day.

414
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,191
Then his ship sank
in the Korean War.

415
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:36,027
And that was that.

416
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:39,488
But I never stopped
raising those flags.

417
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,831
After I moved here,
I wouldn't stop crying.

418
00:38:49,123 --> 00:38:51,500
There was nowhere
to raise Dad's flags.

419
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:54,003
So Grandpa built me
that flagpole.

420
00:39:09,268 --> 00:39:10,519
I'll open the curtains.

421
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:16,484
This used to be Grandpa's office.

422
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:18,903
Now it's my mom's study.

423
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:21,030
It looks like a library.

424
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:24,367
This is your family?

425
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:26,067
Yes.

426
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:28,111
Your father?

427
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:33,542
That's Grandpa.
My dad's right there.

428
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:41,050
Isn't he handsome?
That's when they got married.

429
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:44,720
This is the picture I really like.

430
00:39:55,398 --> 00:39:57,233
Yuichiro Sawamura...?

431
00:39:57,608 --> 00:40:00,945
That's my dad.
Matsuzaki is my mom's name.

432
00:40:01,737 --> 00:40:03,989
Come on, it's speech time.

433
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,909
We better go down.

434
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:58,127
I'm back.

435
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:07,669
You're late.

436
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:11,140
You'll worry your mother.

437
00:41:20,983 --> 00:41:24,820
- Shun, what about dinner?
- I already ate.

438
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,914
<i>He swings... Nagashima strikes out!</i>

439
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:49,345
<i>ONODERA SAWAMURA
TACHIBANA</i>

440
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:55,518
Yuichiro Sawamura...

441
00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:18,374
Thanks for coming.

442
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:20,533
What's going on?

443
00:42:27,216 --> 00:42:30,761
Welcome, volunteers.
The Latin Quarter is all yours.

444
00:42:31,554 --> 00:42:35,057
You have our deepest thanks...

445
00:42:35,307 --> 00:42:38,894
for helping us to preserve
this magnificent cultural landmark.

446
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:48,946
Remember, men.
The heavy lifting is up to you.

447
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,940
Let's do it!

448
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:11,218
My shrine to Reason!

449
00:43:11,427 --> 00:43:14,471
- No exceptions, that's the rule.
- Okay, ready.

450
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:15,931
Here we go.

451
00:43:29,612 --> 00:43:31,614
Be careful, will you?

452
00:43:37,953 --> 00:43:39,455
Hey, watch it!

453
00:43:59,475 --> 00:44:03,062
1st Year Math... 2nd Year Math...
These are old exams.

454
00:44:03,979 --> 00:44:05,856
We use those for forecasts.

455
00:44:06,315 --> 00:44:10,486
Here's Dr. Hokuto's math final.
She got a perfect score.

456
00:44:20,287 --> 00:44:23,499
Take over for me.
We need everything moved.

457
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:25,668
I'll give you a hand.

458
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:30,005
Heads up, Matsuzaki.

459
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:36,011
Mizunuma said to pitch anything
we're not sure we need.

460
00:44:43,352 --> 00:44:44,645
It's so filthy.

461
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:46,772
Didn't you guys ever clean?

462
00:44:47,022 --> 00:44:49,400
Not since I've been here.

463
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:53,028
We better bring
the badminton girls tomorrow.

464
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:55,531
Please do.

465
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:28,605
Sora, I'm going now.

466
00:45:28,897 --> 00:45:30,097
Okay.

467
00:45:30,232 --> 00:45:32,735
I'll be home by dinner.

468
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:53,130
Did something happen?

469
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:56,592
Not a thing.

470
00:45:58,427 --> 00:45:59,928
See you tomorrow.

471
00:46:55,234 --> 00:46:57,820
Dad, can I ask you something?

472
00:46:59,321 --> 00:47:01,657
I'm working. Make it short.

473
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:07,704
Yuichiro Sawamura.
He's my real father, right?

474
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:14,336
We've been over that.

475
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:18,882
You're my son.

476
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,883
It was blowing hard
the night Sawamura brought you.

477
00:48:02,551 --> 00:48:07,222
He had his Family Register with him.

478
00:48:19,693 --> 00:48:22,571
We'd just lost a child
of our own.

479
00:48:24,156 --> 00:48:27,409
Next thing I knew,
your mother was nursing you.

480
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:29,411
She wouldn't let you go.

481
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:36,752
Sawamura was a good sailor.

482
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,506
His supply ship sank
during a battle in the Korean War.

483
00:48:42,132 --> 00:48:44,593
Until the end,
he helped us out.

484
00:48:46,887 --> 00:48:49,890
You remind me of him
more every day.

485
00:48:50,557 --> 00:48:52,517
But you're still our son.

486
00:48:54,603 --> 00:48:56,939
Thanks, Dad.

487
00:49:21,755 --> 00:49:23,298
Is it out there?

488
00:49:23,507 --> 00:49:24,800
Not yet.

489
00:49:36,144 --> 00:49:38,313
Guess it's not coming by today.

490
00:50:14,016 --> 00:50:18,395
THE LATIN QUARTER REBORN!

491
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:30,699
May I...?

492
00:50:30,866 --> 00:50:32,743
Come in, Umi.

493
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,708
You're really leaving.

494
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:41,710
Thanks for all your help.

495
00:50:42,085 --> 00:50:46,214
- I wish I could see you off.
- Go on, I'll be fine.

496
00:50:47,382 --> 00:50:48,582
We'll miss you.

497
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:53,305
I'll drop by now and then.
You'd better get to school.

498
00:50:57,726 --> 00:50:59,603
Good luck with Shun.

499
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:06,777
Take care.

500
00:51:22,584 --> 00:51:25,754
Extra, extra!

501
00:51:26,922 --> 00:51:30,717
Extra edition of
The Latin Quarter Weekly.

502
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:32,803
We'll need your help today.

503
00:51:32,928 --> 00:51:35,972
Latin Quarter gets a facelift!
Extra, extra!

504
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:39,810
I'll be there again today.

505
00:51:40,143 --> 00:51:42,437
Hi. You're working hard.

506
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:45,232
Hey, see you there, okay?

507
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,442
Here, Matsuzaki.

508
00:51:50,946 --> 00:51:54,783
Extra, extra!
Get your Latin Quarter.

509
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:57,744
Extra!

510
00:52:06,128 --> 00:52:07,504
Next label, please.

511
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:16,138
He's so brave.

512
00:52:25,147 --> 00:52:27,315
- This is great.
- Let's go look.

513
00:53:08,481 --> 00:53:10,901
If you don't like me,
just say so.

514
00:53:22,412 --> 00:53:25,582
Yuichiro Sawamura.
He's my real father.

515
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:29,878
It's like some cheap melodrama.

516
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:34,382
I don't understand.

517
00:53:34,758 --> 00:53:38,261
Dad told me years ago.
I even checked at City Hall.

518
00:53:38,595 --> 00:53:39,795
But then...

519
00:53:41,097 --> 00:53:43,266
We're brother and sister.

520
00:53:47,437 --> 00:53:49,189
What should we do?

521
00:53:49,606 --> 00:53:53,276
We forget whatever it was
we felt about each other.

522
00:53:57,113 --> 00:53:59,783
We'll just be friends, like before.

523
00:54:24,516 --> 00:54:27,686
Sora, did something happen
to Umi at school?

524
00:54:28,436 --> 00:54:31,690
No, at least
I don't think so.

525
00:54:32,107 --> 00:54:33,692
Are you sure?

526
00:54:33,942 --> 00:54:36,778
That dinner tonight
was pretty strange.

527
00:54:36,903 --> 00:54:38,822
And she was soaked.

528
00:54:39,489 --> 00:54:44,661
Something must've happened.
She's never come home that late.

529
00:54:53,003 --> 00:54:55,171
Umi, the bath's ready.

530
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:57,674
Not tonight.

531
00:54:59,175 --> 00:55:00,677
Don't you feel well?

532
00:55:47,557 --> 00:55:49,392
Umi...

533
00:55:50,393 --> 00:55:51,593
Umi...

534
00:55:53,396 --> 00:55:54,596
Umi...

535
00:56:43,321 --> 00:56:46,157
Good morning, Umi.
Did you sleep well?

536
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:49,661
Mom? When did you come back?

537
00:56:50,453 --> 00:56:53,790
Don't be silly.
I've been here all along.

538
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:59,462
Umi, I'm hoisting the flags.
Come give me a hand.

539
00:57:14,477 --> 00:57:15,812
Dad...?

540
00:57:18,148 --> 00:57:20,692
I'll be home for a long time.

541
00:57:33,496 --> 00:57:35,999
You're such a big girl now.

542
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:14,514
Need more supplies?
Just ask this guy.

543
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:16,140
He's in construction.

544
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:20,562
- Come on, no more freebies.
- Why not? Business is good.

545
00:59:20,853 --> 00:59:22,480
HOPE YOU guys win.

546
00:59:22,605 --> 00:59:24,232
Thank you.

547
00:59:25,108 --> 00:59:26,149
Unbelievable.

548
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:29,571
We owe this to Dr. Hokuto.
No, even more to Umi.

549
00:59:30,363 --> 00:59:32,740
She's our goddess of good luck.

550
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:34,409
Hi guys-

551
00:59:36,286 --> 00:59:38,913
This is practically
a construction site.

552
00:59:46,629 --> 00:59:48,131
What are you doing?

553
00:59:49,382 --> 00:59:51,801
Give me that for a sec.

554
00:59:52,051 --> 00:59:55,597
Let me show you
how the pros do it.

555
01:00:05,315 --> 01:00:06,608
Incredible!

556
01:00:06,733 --> 01:00:09,444
My dad's a plasterer.

557
01:00:09,736 --> 01:00:11,446
Beautiful...

558
01:00:11,863 --> 01:00:13,114
What's that?

559
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:14,490
The wall, I mean.

560
01:00:14,741 --> 01:00:16,117
WHAT?

561
01:00:22,332 --> 01:00:23,532
Hey.

562
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:25,793
That's it for today.

563
01:00:27,545 --> 01:00:30,965
Thanks for staying late.
You don't have to go back?

564
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:35,470
Sora's covering for me.
Can I help out with anything?

565
01:00:40,016 --> 01:00:41,809
Could you do this?

566
01:00:46,356 --> 01:00:48,024
Can I have two days?

567
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:51,194
That'll really help, thanks.

568
01:00:51,361 --> 01:00:53,655
- See you.
- So long.

569
01:01:21,557 --> 01:01:27,457
VISIT THE NEW LATIN QUARTER!

570
01:01:33,736 --> 01:01:39,575
MAJORITY OF GIRLS
OPPOSE DEMOLITION!

571
01:01:46,082 --> 01:01:51,587
MIDTERM RESULTS ANNOUNCED,
TEST FORECAST VINDICATED!

572
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:03,433
MAJORITY OF ALL STUDENTS
OPPOSE DEMOLITION!

573
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:16,779
Ready, everybody?

574
01:02:44,432 --> 01:02:46,309
Umi, don't go.

575
01:02:46,976 --> 01:02:48,936
Shun, it's bad news.

576
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:52,190
The board just voted
to tear us down.

577
01:02:55,902 --> 01:02:58,154
The principal won't listen to reason.

578
01:02:58,321 --> 01:02:59,822
All our hard work!

579
01:02:59,989 --> 01:03:04,076
- They won't even come?
- Then they'd have to back down.

580
01:03:04,327 --> 01:03:05,527
Right!

581
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:08,289
Mob the principal's office!

582
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:10,875
Let's go straight to the chairman.

583
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:15,671
Of the Tokumaru Foundation?
He's pretty hard to see.

584
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:19,175
You guys go see him.
Tell him how it is.

585
01:03:19,342 --> 01:03:21,344
Yes, please go.

586
01:03:22,553 --> 01:03:24,847
Mizunuma, we've got to go to Tokyo.

587
01:03:27,767 --> 01:03:28,967
Please!

588
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:35,191
It's worth a shot.
Umi, we need you too.

589
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:38,569
Tell him, Umi!

590
01:03:48,162 --> 01:03:51,207
Umi, good luck tomorrow.

591
01:04:08,516 --> 01:04:09,892
Good morning.

592
01:04:11,227 --> 01:04:12,562
Did you skip class?

593
01:04:12,895 --> 01:04:15,857
No, I told them yesterday
I'd be absent.

594
01:04:16,399 --> 01:04:19,235
Then we'd better get going.

595
01:04:33,749 --> 01:04:37,253
FOR A SUCCESSFUL OLYMPICS,
MAKE TOKYO BEAUTIFUL

596
01:05:04,947 --> 01:05:06,782
Let's give it our best shot.

597
01:05:08,367 --> 01:05:11,829
Yes, that's what they say.

598
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:14,123
No appointment?

599
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,834
We're appealing directly
to Mr. Tokumaru.

600
01:05:17,293 --> 01:05:19,629
Something about a direct appeal.

601
01:05:19,962 --> 01:05:22,798
Yes, students from Konan Academy.

602
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:24,967
Three of them.

603
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:27,470
All right.

604
01:05:29,055 --> 01:05:33,142
Take the elevator
to the fourth floor and wait there.

605
01:05:33,976 --> 01:05:35,176
Fourth floor.

606
01:05:35,478 --> 01:05:38,356
Don't forget to sign in.
One name is fine.

607
01:05:48,491 --> 01:05:50,284
Are you the Konan students?

608
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:51,860
Yes.

609
01:05:52,995 --> 01:05:54,997
The president's very busy.

610
01:05:55,206 --> 01:05:58,668
I can't guarantee
he'll have time for you.

611
01:05:59,085 --> 01:06:00,419
We're sorry to disturb him.

612
01:06:00,544 --> 01:06:04,674
We didn't think he'd agree
to an appointment.

613
01:06:06,217 --> 01:06:10,096
You may just be
wasting your time...

614
01:06:10,262 --> 01:06:12,682
but please wait here if you like.

615
01:06:13,724 --> 01:06:15,351
We'll Wait!

616
01:06:16,185 --> 01:06:18,980
Oh come on,
Kimura has the best pastries.

617
01:06:19,105 --> 01:06:20,690
Nakamura's hard to beat.

618
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:24,694
I can't believe you'd say that.
You don't know your pastries.

619
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:31,399
Thank you.

620
01:06:59,395 --> 01:07:02,440
It's as plain
as the nose on your face.

621
01:07:14,577 --> 01:07:17,246
Come on in, kids.

622
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:23,586
Excuse us.

623
01:07:29,133 --> 01:07:30,760
Have a seat.

624
01:07:30,926 --> 01:07:32,928
Be with you in a minute.

625
01:07:33,554 --> 01:07:37,933
So you see how it is.
Yes, give him my regards.

626
01:07:45,775 --> 01:07:47,276
Sit.

627
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:50,279
Now, why aren't you kids
in school?

628
01:07:50,446 --> 01:07:52,281
We escaped.

629
01:07:52,448 --> 01:07:55,951
Escaped?
I did that a lot myself.

630
01:07:56,786 --> 01:07:59,622
You're here about
your clubhouse, I suppose.

631
01:07:59,789 --> 01:08:04,627
Yes, we'd like to ask you
to come and inspect it yourself.

632
01:08:04,794 --> 01:08:06,629
You're welcome any time.

633
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:10,257
What year are you?

634
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:13,761
I'm a junior. Umi Matsuzaki.

635
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:16,263
I help out with the school paper.

636
01:08:17,807 --> 01:08:20,351
What do you care
about that old shack?

637
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,812
We all love it.

638
01:08:23,187 --> 01:08:27,650
We spent hours making it look new.
Please see for yourself.

639
01:08:29,944 --> 01:08:31,821
You cleaned it up?

640
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:34,990
What does your father do?

641
01:08:36,117 --> 01:08:39,245
He was a ship captain
in the Korean War.

642
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:41,831
His ship hit a mine.

643
01:09:14,905 --> 01:09:16,532
A supply ship?

644
01:09:16,824 --> 01:09:18,024
Yes.

645
01:09:19,243 --> 01:09:20,536
I see.

646
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:25,541
It must've been hard
for your mother, raising you alone.

647
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:28,043
She did a fine job.

648
01:09:29,378 --> 01:09:30,578
Thank you.

649
01:09:31,755 --> 01:09:34,049
All right, I'll go.

650
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:39,221
Thank you!

651
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:43,058
It's me.

652
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:44,592
What's on tomorrow?

653
01:09:45,686 --> 01:09:47,730
Let's see, that's in the evening.

654
01:09:48,898 --> 01:09:50,566
Move the rest to Friday.

655
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:54,737
It's settled.
Tomorrow afternoon.

656
01:09:54,904 --> 01:09:58,949
I'll contact your principal
and do an official inspection tour.

657
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:07,583
- Some grownups are pretty cool.
- Don't count your chickens.

658
01:10:09,335 --> 01:10:10,753
I'm glad we came.

659
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:16,926
I have to swing by my uncle's place.
See you tomorrow.

660
01:10:53,796 --> 01:10:56,632
What are you doing
after graduation?

661
01:10:56,799 --> 01:11:00,469
I can't afford much tuition.
I'll apply to a national university.

662
01:11:01,136 --> 01:11:02,805
What about the Weekly?

663
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:06,475
I'll find somebody to take over
after things are settled.

664
01:11:06,809 --> 01:11:08,102
What about you?

665
01:11:10,062 --> 01:11:11,647
I haven't decided.

666
01:11:12,189 --> 01:11:14,984
I'd like to be a doctor, though.

667
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:26,620
Are you the one
who wrote that poem?

668
01:11:28,289 --> 01:11:32,001
I saw you raising your flags
every morning from my dad's tug.

669
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:36,672
I can't see the tug passing by
from the garden.

670
01:11:37,339 --> 01:11:41,510
That's why I never noticed
you were answering me.

671
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:54,982
Shun?

672
01:11:57,609 --> 01:12:00,195
Listen, I...

673
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:06,076
Those flags
were a message to my dad.

674
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:10,581
I think he sent you to me.
That's what I want to believe.

675
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:17,588
I'm in love with you, Shun.

676
01:12:18,047 --> 01:12:19,247
Umi...

677
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:22,217
Even if we're related,
even if you're my brother...

678
01:12:22,384 --> 01:12:24,219
my feelings will never change.

679
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:35,689
I feel the same about you.

680
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:57,586
I'm back.

681
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,000
Let's try it.

682
01:13:04,093 --> 01:13:05,293
Mom!

683
01:13:06,053 --> 01:13:07,638
Umi, I'm home.

684
01:13:08,138 --> 01:13:11,100
Finally! How was America?

685
01:13:11,225 --> 01:13:14,103
I was busy learning every day.

686
01:13:14,728 --> 01:13:16,772
Any boyfriends yet, Sora?

687
01:13:16,897 --> 01:13:18,232
Not yet.

688
01:13:18,357 --> 01:13:20,776
This is great stuff, Mom.

689
01:13:21,068 --> 01:13:22,486
It's called jerky.

690
01:13:22,903 --> 01:13:23,945
Is it pork?

691
01:13:23,946 --> 01:13:26,949
Hiro, it says beef
on the package.

692
01:13:38,293 --> 01:13:39,628
Mom?

693
01:13:42,881 --> 01:13:44,925
You're up pretty late.

694
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:51,432
I wanted to ask you something.

695
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,308
Ask away, then.

696
01:13:58,772 --> 01:14:00,482
I'm wide awake.

697
01:14:00,858 --> 01:14:03,986
Sorting through these books
woke me up even more.

698
01:14:04,403 --> 01:14:07,948
There's this boy at school.
His name is Shun Kazama.

699
01:14:11,201 --> 01:14:13,328
He came for the farewell party.

700
01:14:13,495 --> 01:14:17,332
I showed him Dad's picture.
He had the same photo.

701
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:20,836
He says his real father
is Yuichiro Sawamura.

702
01:14:40,147 --> 01:14:41,356
This one?

703
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:51,533
I'm afraid this is all
a little bit complicated.

704
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:56,497
I told you about how
your father and I eloped.

705
01:14:57,664 --> 01:14:59,583
You remember, don't you?

706
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:04,046
Our first place
was that second-floor apartment.

707
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,591
Yuichiro was away a lot.

708
01:15:07,758 --> 01:15:12,888
I was pregnant with you
and working on my degree.

709
01:15:13,722 --> 01:15:18,060
I loved school so much.
I was determined to do well.

710
01:15:34,535 --> 01:15:35,735
Yuichi...

711
01:15:36,703 --> 01:15:39,081
Yuichiro, whose baby is that?

712
01:15:39,915 --> 01:15:42,584
It's Tachibana's boy.
He's ours now.

713
01:15:44,586 --> 01:15:49,091
Tachibana was killed in an accident
on a repatriation ship.

714
01:15:49,466 --> 01:15:52,886
His wife died giving birth.
The Bomb killed their relatives.

715
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:58,100
If we don't register him as ours,
he'll end up in an orphanage.

716
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:06,108
Yuichiro registered the baby
as his son and brought him home.

717
01:16:06,441 --> 01:16:10,612
The war had just ended.
It was happening everywhere.

718
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:16,910
But I was already pregnant.
There was no way I could raise him.

719
01:16:17,286 --> 01:16:21,915
Yuichiro's friend lost a child,
so we gave the baby up.

720
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:25,919
Is he doing well?

721
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:30,632
I'm so glad.

722
01:16:31,425 --> 01:16:35,971
Your father was so good-hearted.
Maybe just a little impulsive.

723
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:40,142
Without his help,
I couldn't have finished school.

724
01:16:41,226 --> 01:16:46,815
But what if Shun
was really Dad's son?

725
01:16:47,941 --> 01:16:50,152
If he was really Yuichiro's son?

726
01:16:50,777 --> 01:16:52,321
I'd like to meet him.

727
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:54,823
Does he look like this picture?

728
01:17:06,043 --> 01:17:07,336
Umi...

729
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:43,246
See you tonight.

730
01:17:43,955 --> 01:17:45,540
Have a nice day.

731
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:50,772
Welcome to the Latin Quarter.

732
01:19:05,912 --> 01:19:09,791
LATIN QUARTER WELCOMES
CHAIRMAN TOKUMARU

733
01:19:17,549 --> 01:19:20,343
I never realized this building
was so impressive.

734
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,137
Thank you, sir.

735
01:19:23,805 --> 01:19:26,141
What are you studying?

736
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:30,103
Sir! The Astronomy Club
has studied sunspots for 10 years.

737
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:34,316
10 years?
And what did you discover?

738
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:38,820
The sun is very old,
and our lifespan is short.

739
01:19:38,945 --> 01:19:40,280
No discoveries so far!

740
01:19:40,739 --> 01:19:42,783
Excellent answer.

741
01:19:49,498 --> 01:19:51,666
The Philosophy Club?

742
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:55,086
Wouldn't you like
a brand new clubhouse?

743
01:19:56,379 --> 01:19:58,840
What about your junior members?

744
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:03,345
Sir, we philosophers
can be content with just a barrel.

745
01:20:03,637 --> 01:20:05,514
Diogenes! Very good.

746
01:20:09,768 --> 01:20:13,355
Principal, your students
are really quite impressive.

747
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:17,526
Shun Kazama?

748
01:20:24,825 --> 01:20:26,201
Hello, Dad?

749
01:20:26,409 --> 01:20:28,870
The third man
in the photo is here.

750
01:20:29,162 --> 01:20:31,206
He can tell you
about your father.

751
01:20:32,624 --> 01:20:35,836
His ship leaves at four o'clock.

752
01:20:36,127 --> 01:20:39,381
He won't be back for months.
Get down here!

753
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:55,105
<i>Should the world sink</i>

754
01:20:55,647 --> 01:20:59,609
<i>Beneath the indigo waves</i>

755
01:20:59,734 --> 01:21:04,239
<i>Stand fast, sink not</i>

756
01:21:04,573 --> 01:21:09,411
<i>Beneath that horizon</i>

757
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:14,207
<i>Stand fast against the flood</i>

758
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:18,753
<i>Like a great range of mountains</i>

759
01:21:19,421 --> 01:21:23,091
<i>With pinnacles thrust high</i>

760
01:21:23,258 --> 01:21:27,888
<i>Into the Winds of the future</i>

761
01:21:28,221 --> 01:21:33,268
<i>Should the World sink</i>

762
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:37,314
<i>Beneath the indigo waves</i>

763
01:21:37,564 --> 01:21:41,776
<i>Stand fast, sink not</i>

764
01:21:42,235 --> 01:21:46,615
<i>Beneath that horizon</i>

765
01:21:48,783 --> 01:21:52,954
My friends, you have shown me
the Latin Quarter's true value.

766
01:21:53,079 --> 01:21:57,125
How can we educate the young
without protecting our culture?

767
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:03,632
I'll just find a different site
for the new building.

768
01:22:05,467 --> 01:22:08,136
All right!

769
01:22:08,678 --> 01:22:10,805
Umi, you did it.

770
01:22:11,097 --> 01:22:12,641
We all did it.

771
01:22:12,891 --> 01:22:15,477
Awesome! Magnificent!

772
01:22:21,816 --> 01:22:24,319
On to the next experiment.

773
01:22:25,528 --> 01:22:27,822
Umi, we owe this to you.

774
01:22:28,823 --> 01:22:31,326
But I didn't do anything special.

775
01:22:31,618 --> 01:22:34,079
Fixing things up was your idea.

776
01:22:34,245 --> 01:22:35,329
She's right.

777
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:37,499
Thank you, Umi.

778
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:41,378
Good for you. Umi.

779
01:22:42,754 --> 01:22:43,954
Umi!

780
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:50,845
The perfect couple.

781
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:55,100
Please excuse them, sir.

782
01:22:55,225 --> 01:22:58,353
Something very important
is happening to both of them.

783
01:22:58,645 --> 01:23:00,397
They have to hurry.

784
01:23:01,022 --> 01:23:04,693
Escape.
It's great to be young.

785
01:23:09,155 --> 01:23:10,365
Shun!

786
01:23:10,907 --> 01:23:12,867
Give us a ride.

787
01:23:13,618 --> 01:23:15,036
Umi?

788
01:23:24,087 --> 01:23:27,716
Don't worry Umi,
I'll get you there in time.

789
01:23:39,102 --> 01:23:40,562
We'd better run.

790
01:23:40,687 --> 01:23:42,063
Thanks!

791
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:45,400
Good luck, Umi.

792
01:23:52,824 --> 01:23:55,577
Come on, Shun. Hurry!

793
01:23:56,786 --> 01:23:57,986
Thanks.

794
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,152
That's my dad's tug.

795
01:24:56,179 --> 01:24:58,306
Here they are, captain.

796
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:09,943
Push our departure back
15 minutes.

797
01:25:14,489 --> 01:25:17,992
So you're Tachibana's boy.

798
01:25:19,452 --> 01:25:21,996
And you must be
Sawamura's daughter.

799
01:25:22,288 --> 01:25:23,665
Both fine-looking youngsters.

800
01:25:39,472 --> 01:25:41,182
It's Shun, right?

801
01:25:41,933 --> 01:25:44,686
Your father was Hiroshi Tachibana.

802
01:25:44,978 --> 01:25:47,856
Front row, fourth from the right.

803
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:50,859
You can see Sawamura
next to him.

804
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:54,028
We three were close friends.

805
01:25:55,238 --> 01:25:57,866
Take the seat of honor, Tachibana.

806
01:25:57,991 --> 01:25:58,991
Why me?

807
01:25:58,992 --> 01:26:01,202
You're our leader.
You belong there.

808
01:26:01,452 --> 01:26:03,872
All right, let's do it.

809
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:09,210
Just don't die before me, okay?

810
01:26:10,086 --> 01:26:11,713
Same goes for you.

811
01:26:12,172 --> 01:26:13,590
Here we go.

812
01:26:26,019 --> 01:26:30,565
I was away at sea
when your parents passed on.

813
01:26:30,857 --> 01:26:34,235
Otherwise I'd have done
exactly what Sawamura did.

814
01:26:35,528 --> 01:26:40,074
Meeting you two
is like seeing my old friends again.

815
01:26:40,366 --> 01:26:43,536
Thank you both.
I've never been so happy.

816
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:09,957
<i>A cross the shining sea,
A ship disappears in the sunlight</i>

817
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:16,880
<i>Its horn trails a note of farewell</i>

818
01:27:18,112 --> 01:27:24,012
<i>If I walk down that gentle slope</i>

819
01:27:24,744 --> 01:27:30,644
<i>Will I feel a breeze the color of summer?</i>

820
01:27:31,668 --> 01:27:37,568
<i>My love is a melody</i>

821
01:27:38,466 --> 01:27:44,180
<i>I sing it high and low</i>

822
01:27:45,223 --> 01:27:51,123
<i>My love is a seagull</i>

823
01:27:52,105 --> 01:27:57,986
<i>That soars and swoops</i>

824
01:27:59,028 --> 01:28:04,928
<i>If I call out to you at twilight</i>

825
01:28:07,704 --> 01:28:12,750
<i>Will I see you there my sweet?</i>

826
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:51,099
<i>Swaying branches along the path</i>

827
01:28:52,165 --> 01:28:58,065
<i>Leave farewell shadows on the ground</i>

828
01:28:59,047 --> 01:29:04,947
<i>A weather vane rooster, an old chapel</i>

829
01:29:06,012 --> 01:29:11,912
<i>Will I see a city
Steeped in summer hues?</i>

830
01:29:12,852 --> 01:29:18,752
<i>Yesterday's love is my fears</i>

831
01:29:19,567 --> 01:29:25,239
<i>They dry and vanish with time</i>

832
01:29:26,532 --> 01:29:32,432
<i>Tomorrow's love is a refrain</i>

833
01:29:33,373 --> 01:29:39,273
<i>Words without end</i>

834
01:29:40,213 --> 01:29:46,113
<i>If we meet at twilight</i>

835
01:29:47,053 --> 01:29:52,953
<i>Will you hold me in your arms?</i>

836
01:30:17,708 --> 01:30:22,130
