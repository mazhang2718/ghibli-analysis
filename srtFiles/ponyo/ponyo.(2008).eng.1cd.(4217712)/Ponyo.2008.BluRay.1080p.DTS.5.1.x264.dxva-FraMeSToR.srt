1
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:24,056
PONYO ON THE CLIFF

2
00:07:22,217 --> 00:07:24,718
Sosuke, come right back up, OK?

3
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:25,803
OK!

4
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:07,488
It's a goldfish!

5
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,086
I can't get it out.

6
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:40,646
That was weird.

7
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,954
It looks kind of dead.

8
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,335
It licked me! It's alive!

9
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:08,215
Sosuke, we have to go!

10
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,927
- Lisa, a goldfish!
- Sosuke!

11
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,231
This wind is crazy.

12
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,859
Sosuke, I'm starting the car now!

13
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:37,286
Have you found her?

14
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:45,961
What? She was captured by a human?

15
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,383
This is bad. This is very bad.

16
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,411
Is it already dead?

17
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:28,587
It's alive!

18
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,890
Sosuke.

19
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:46,021
- We're gonna be late!
- Lisa, the goldfish is alive!

20
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:49,566
- A goldfish?
- It was right down by the rocks.

21
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:50,692
Yeah?

22
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:19,179
I don't know who you are, but please
don't spray pesticide around here!

23
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:24,309
Oh, no. This is not pesticide.

24
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:27,646
I brought this water from deep sea
to prevent extreme dry skin...

25
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,815
Whatever.
As long as it's not pesticide.

26
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:31,817
Excuse us.

27
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,411
This is bad. This is very bad.

28
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:48,459
That guy was a freak show. Just kidding.
Never say such a thing, Sosuke.

29
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:51,753
- We never judge others by their looks.
- I don't say such things.

30
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,840
- Are you taking that to pre-school?
- Yeah.

31
00:12:55,175 --> 00:13:00,512
- Your teachers don't tell you not to?
- Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

32
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,055
She's cute.

33
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:10,814
A ship must be coming in today.

34
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,610
Sosuke, eat your breakfast.

35
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:18,572
I wonder if she would eat this.

36
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:20,407
Want some?

37
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,036
Hey! My cut is all gone!

38
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:29,875
Lisa, I think I'll call her Ponyo.

39
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:34,171
She came to me.
Besides, she might be magic.

40
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:37,382
Ponyo licked my cut
and it healed right away.

41
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:48,977
Do you wanna eat ham?

42
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,828
Lisa, Ponyo really likes to eat ham.

43
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,580
Just like me.

44
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:40,153
- Oh, dear... Oh, dear...
- Come on, Lisa, hurry!

45
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,123
Filthy. It's so filthy!

46
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,960
Good morning!

47
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,428
Ponyo, look.
You can see our house.

48
00:15:26,284 --> 00:15:27,951
- We'll park here. OK?
- Yeah.

49
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:30,329
- Have a nice day.
- See you later.

50
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,582
Morning! Sorry for being late!

51
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,001
- Get Noriko's wheelchair?
- Sure.

52
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,768
Good morning, Sosuke.

53
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,687
I'm busy right now, Yoshie.
I'll talk to you later.

54
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:58,649
- Oh, my...
- Sosuke, dear.

55
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:01,360
- Toki, I'll catch you later.
- My goodness...

56
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,702
I wonder if my teacher will say no.

57
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:13,455
I got it.

58
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:20,462
You'll wait here. I'll be back soon.

59
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,217
I hope cats won't come around here.

60
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:39,439
Stay put. I'll be right back.

61
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,282
See you later. Hello there, Toshi.

62
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:54,121
She has a little fever,
but she's active. She should be OK.

63
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,915
- Right, sweetie?
- Oh, thank you. Bye-bye.

64
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,502
- Good morning, Teacher.
- Good morning, Sosuke.

65
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,878
How are you, Sosuke?

66
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:09,594
- Sosuke!
- Kumiko!

67
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,806
Look! Isn't this dress pretty?
My mom bought it for me.

68
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,890
Is that so?

69
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,520
- Hey, Sosuke, wanna go play?
- I can't. I'm busy right now.

70
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,898
- What are you doing here?
- Like I said, I'm busy.

71
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:25,110
- You're acting weird, Sosuke.
- Yeah, weird.

72
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,340
Ponyo!

73
00:17:55,183 --> 00:17:56,183
Sosuke!

74
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:59,227
- Oh, Kumiko.
- What is that?

75
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,897
You're not supposed to
bring stuff to school.

76
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,774
These brushes are not school's.

77
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:06,401
They're on the senior center property,
so it's OK.

78
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,903
Let me see!

79
00:18:08,863 --> 00:18:10,113
Oh, a goldfish!

80
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:12,824
She's not just a goldfish.
She's Ponyo.

81
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:15,327
Ponyo? I wanna see!

82
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,496
If I show her, you won't tell anyone?

83
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,080
No, I won't.

84
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,751
Look. Isn't she cute?

85
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:32,844
She's weird. She's fat, too.
My goldfish is cuter.

86
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:59,663
That one was Kumiko's fault. You should
Never judge others by their looks.

87
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:05,377
Let's get you some more water.

88
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,109
Ponyo!

89
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:37,117
I'm relieved.

90
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:47,544
That's strange... I hear Sosuke's voice.

91
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:52,966
But he's supposed to be
in school right now.

92
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,888
- So it must be only in my head.
- Look, Yoshie. I'm right over here.

93
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:02,392
Oh, my... Sosuke is here.

94
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,271
Do I have something nice?

95
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:08,356
- Yes, you do.
- Bingo!

96
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:12,152
All right then, what color is it?

97
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,615
- Red!
- Red!

98
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:17,782
That's right!

99
00:20:19,076 --> 00:20:22,704
- How did you both guess that?
- Come on, show us!

100
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:23,788
OK.

101
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:29,878
- Pretty!
- Cute.

102
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,380
Her name is Ponyo.
She likes to eat ham.

103
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,382
And she can do magic!

104
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:39,304
A cut on my thumb disappeared
because Ponyo licked it.

105
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:45,226
Maybe she could lick our legs.

106
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:49,522
I wish I could run fast, once again,
like you, Sosuke.

107
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:53,526
Well, I'd have to ask Ponyo.
I can't speak for her.

108
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:57,155
- Let me take a look, too.
- Sure, Toki.

109
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:02,661
Oh, no! It's a fish with a human face!

110
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:07,499
Hurry up! Put it back in the ocean.
Don't you realize it'll cause a tsunami?

111
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,669
Here you go again, Toki,
worrying about a tsunami.

112
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:14,589
When fish with faces come out to
the beach, tsunamis will come.

113
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,424
That's what they always say.

114
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,180
Tsunami! Tsunami is here!

115
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:25,350
Tsunami is here!

116
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,185
Tsunami...

117
00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:34,776
- Toki, what's the matter?
- My clothes are all ruined!

118
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:55,463
Sosuke!

119
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:01,678
Sosuke! Come back here
and apologize to Toki!

120
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:15,150
Don't worry, Ponyo.
No matter what, I will protect you.

121
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:23,199
Sosuke!

122
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:28,538
Ponyo!

123
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:33,585
Ponyo. Sosuke.

124
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,756
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

125
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:48,099
- I will love you, too.
- Ponyo loves Sosuke!

126
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:30,308
Ponyo!

127
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:34,145
Ponyo! Ponyo!

128
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:36,481
Ponyo!

129
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,694
Ponyo! Ponyo!

130
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,572
Sosuke!

131
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:52,664
Ponyo! Ponyo!

132
00:23:53,874 --> 00:23:54,874
Ponyo!

133
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:52,599
Listen, Sosuke,
there's such a thing as destiny.

134
00:24:52,683 --> 00:24:55,226
You can't change one's destiny
no matter how tough it is.

135
00:24:55,978 --> 00:25:00,064
I think Ponyo went back to the ocean
because she was meant to live there.

136
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,735
Anyway, hopefully
that pesticide guy is gone.

137
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:06,738
Can I have a lick?

138
00:25:07,448 --> 00:25:09,199
Hurry, it's starting to melt.

139
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:13,745
It's yummy!

140
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:22,503
Come on. Cheer up!
Koichi is finally coming home today.

141
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:26,132
He'll be disappointed
if you are all bummed out.

142
00:25:52,576 --> 00:25:54,869
Don't go down to the water
anymore today.

143
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:55,954
OK.

144
00:26:22,231 --> 00:26:23,648
Sosuke.

145
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,442
Time to come in now.

146
00:26:26,902 --> 00:26:31,155
If I leave the pail here, Ponyo will
know where we live when she comes back.

147
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,951
That's true.
Do that if you want to, Sosuke.

148
00:26:35,035 --> 00:26:36,369
Yeah.

149
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:52,051
Sosuke, can you get that?
It must be Koichi.

150
00:26:54,805 --> 00:26:57,849
Hello? Yep. It's me.

151
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,601
Yeah. I'm doing fine.

152
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:05,273
I can't come home tonight. Help me
with the signal when I pass offshore.

153
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,191
OK. I'll let you talk to Lisa.

154
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:10,737
Koichi? Yeah.

155
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:15,074
What?! That's not fair...
Just say no!

156
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:19,162
Go ahead, abandon your wife and child
up here on a cliff all alone.

157
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:20,455
I give up! Whatever!

158
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,463
Come on, Sosuke.
Let's eat out tonight.

159
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,299
I wanna eat at home.

160
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:03,998
That's Koichi. Lisa, it's Koichi's ship!
Turn off the lights!

161
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:31,651
That's Sosuke, what a genius!
He's only five years old!

162
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:33,903
Your wife must be pretty mad.

163
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:42,036
S... O... R... R... Y.
Lisa, he's saying he's sorry.

164
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:48,334
B... U... G... O... F... F...

165
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:52,130
B-U-G O-F-F. B-U-G O-F-F.

166
00:28:57,386 --> 00:28:59,137
Lisa, he says he loves you.

167
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:02,390
He says, "Lots and lots."

168
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:09,647
BUG OFF BUG OFF BUG OFF BUG OFF

169
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:17,905
Wow! Isn't that pretty?

170
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:26,539
PRAYING FOR SAFE SAILING

171
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:31,669
THANKS

172
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:34,547
GOOD NIGHT

173
00:29:52,232 --> 00:29:54,483
Don't cry, Lisa.

174
00:29:55,485 --> 00:29:57,195
I won't cry, either. So...

175
00:29:58,488 --> 00:30:01,991
I promised Ponyo I'd protect her.

176
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:09,415
I wonder if she's crying now.

177
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:15,713
All right. I'm gonna cheer up!

178
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:19,717
Happy as can be

179
00:30:20,677 --> 00:30:22,136
Don't you worry, Sosuke.

180
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:26,682
You did your best
and Ponyo will be just fine.

181
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:28,726
OK.

182
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:33,773
Now, let's eat dinner!
We'll finish Koichi's portion, too!

183
00:30:43,617 --> 00:30:45,284
What have I done?

184
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:49,830
It was my fault that I had brought you
to show you the work at the farm.

185
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:56,337
Have I not taught you over and over
how the humans dirty up water and air?

186
00:30:56,421 --> 00:31:01,050
Come on, now. Eat.
Can't you hear me, Brunhilde?

187
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,928
I want ham!

188
00:31:06,556 --> 00:31:10,768
Ham? Where did you learn
of such a horrifying thing!

189
00:31:10,852 --> 00:31:12,061
Tell me, Brunhilde.

190
00:31:12,646 --> 00:31:16,148
My name is not Brunhilde. It's Ponyo.

191
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:18,150
P... P... Ponyo?

192
00:31:18,235 --> 00:31:20,695
Ponyo! Ponyo loves Sosuke!

193
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:23,406
I will be a human, too!

194
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:28,786
Human? What's good about
such a foolish, horrid species?

195
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:32,415
All they do is to take life
out of the ocean.

196
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:35,710
I was once, long ago, a human myself.

197
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:38,421
You have no idea
what it took to give up being human...

198
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:40,548
I want hands!

199
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:44,176
I don't want these flippers anymore!

200
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:49,473
- I want feet, like Sosuke!
- That's enough!

201
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:12,163
I made hands! I made feet, too!

202
00:32:12,706 --> 00:32:13,748
Yes! Hooray!

203
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:17,418
Don't tell me you have
licked human blood!

204
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,754
- I'm going to Sosuke!
- No!

205
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:23,257
The DNA contamination activated
a congenital inferior factor!

206
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:26,010
Revert. Revert. Revert!
Revert! Revert! Revert!

207
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:34,477
There. There. There. There. Here we go!

208
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:40,649
Oh, no. I don't have enough power!

209
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,279
Let me out! Let me out!

210
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:48,824
Let me out!

211
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,703
Let me out! Let me out!

212
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:55,498
Let me out!

213
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:58,376
Evil blood, calm down.

214
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:01,712
Be still, be still,
be still, be still, be still.

215
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:14,475
She's already so powerful.
Just like her mother.

216
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:23,067
If you could only remain
innocent and pure forever.

217
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:47,258
I don't have the power
to hold her for very long.

218
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:49,677
I need to ask for her mother's help now.

219
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,095
I... What?

220
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:01,522
Oh, no! They're headed for my elixirs.

221
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:04,567
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!

222
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:07,611
That was too close.
The anti-crab barrier was loose.

223
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:10,281
I must be careful
not to upset the balance of nature.

224
00:34:10,365 --> 00:34:11,407
Calm. I must remain calm.

225
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:14,785
When I think of meeting her again,
my heart won't stop pounding.

226
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,622
Focus on work.
This batch is already ready.

227
00:34:28,091 --> 00:34:29,967
The barrier is not loose in here, is it?

228
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:32,178
PANGEA
1907

229
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,515
This door still doesn't fit right.

230
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,397
I'll fix that next.

231
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,573
If even one living creature
got in here...

232
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:22,686
Yes. I can feel the power of the ocean
in the furthest reaches of my DNA.

233
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:27,858
When this well is full, then the age
of the ocean will begin again.

234
00:35:27,943 --> 00:35:31,111
An explosion of life
to match the Cambrian Age.

235
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:33,697
An end to the era
of those abominable humans.

236
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:40,788
This cursed door!

237
00:37:04,706 --> 00:37:06,123
Teeth!

238
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:16,258
Let's find Sosuke!

239
00:39:25,638 --> 00:39:28,140
I'm free!

240
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:50,496
- Waterspout!
- Captain, look over there!

241
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:59,213
- It's a tsunami!
- Turn the ship into the wave!

242
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,839
Look! What is that?

243
00:40:05,845 --> 00:40:08,806
Captain, the radio
and radar are both dead!

244
00:40:12,435 --> 00:40:15,979
It's a little girl.
Looks like she's about Sosuke's age.

245
00:40:29,536 --> 00:40:32,704
- Thanks again.
- Sure. Take care.

246
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:37,042
Why don't you wait here, Sosuke?
I'll stay with you.

247
00:40:37,126 --> 00:40:40,420
I'll take the shortcut, so I'll be OK.
Goodbye, Teacher.

248
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:41,839
Goodbye.

249
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:43,674
Be careful!

250
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,343
Sosuke, I'm sorry.

251
00:41:28,428 --> 00:41:31,305
The door didn't open, right?
The power just went out.

252
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:33,307
- Everything OK at school?
- Yeah.

253
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:36,810
Lisa, we'll be fine.
So why don't you go home?

254
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:38,228
But Ms. Kaneko is not here yet.

255
00:41:38,313 --> 00:41:40,939
It'll be fine. She must be
running a little late.

256
00:41:41,024 --> 00:41:43,984
We'll have to spend the night anyway.

257
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,653
If I were you,
I'd get out of here while you still can.

258
00:41:48,031 --> 00:41:50,991
- Sosuke, wait here for a while.
- OK.

259
00:42:02,003 --> 00:42:03,003
Hi, Yoshie.

260
00:42:04,047 --> 00:42:06,673
Oh, Sosuke. Is that you?

261
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:11,053
- It's so dark I could barely see.
- Here. This is for you.

262
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:18,393
- Let's see... What is it?
- There's one for you, too, Noriko.

263
00:42:18,478 --> 00:42:19,811
Thank you.

264
00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:22,481
It's pitch dark. I can't see a thing.

265
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:25,317
I can't believe the power is down
from such little rain.

266
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:28,403
That's why I didn't want a sleepover.

267
00:42:32,033 --> 00:42:33,867
The power's back on! Good!

268
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:37,037
Nice and bright. It's a goldfish!

269
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:41,541
I bet the lights came back on
because Sosuke's here.

270
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:46,713
The very powerful, micro-typhoon
is still maintaining the power, and...

271
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:50,217
This stupid TV.

272
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:55,514
Nobody understands weather anymore.
Their forecasts are never right.

273
00:42:55,598 --> 00:42:57,516
You should take your mother home now.

274
00:42:58,101 --> 00:43:02,980
With our lucky goldfish to
keep us company, we won't be scared.

275
00:43:03,064 --> 00:43:04,064
OK.

276
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:13,407
This is for you, Toki.

277
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:21,665
- It's wrinkled. What is it?
- It goes like this.

278
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:28,547
- I got it. It's a grasshopper.
- No, it's the Koganei Maru.

279
00:43:28,631 --> 00:43:31,675
That's the name of your father's ship,
isn't it, Sosuke?

280
00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:34,720
- Right.
- It does look like a grasshopper.

281
00:43:35,221 --> 00:43:39,016
Sosuke, we've gotta get on the road.
Let's hurry now and say goodbye.

282
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:45,605
- OK. Ladies, good evening.
- Good evening.

283
00:43:46,399 --> 00:43:48,734
Be careful the wind
doesn't blow you away.

284
00:43:49,944 --> 00:43:51,194
Get in from this side.

285
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:58,035
They said the phones are out, too.

286
00:44:21,768 --> 00:44:23,560
The ocean looks all puffed up.

287
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:29,941
You think the storm
could sink the ships?

288
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:34,946
No. Ships can handle a storm. I'm sure
that's what Koichi is doing right now.

289
00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:48,960
I saw a fish!
Did you see that, Lisa?

290
00:44:49,045 --> 00:44:50,128
Put your seatbelt on!

291
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:03,308
Lisa! You can't cross here!

292
00:45:03,392 --> 00:45:06,061
We just got word.
They're gonna evacuate this side.

293
00:45:06,229 --> 00:45:10,607
Evacuate? There are some people
up at the senior center.

294
00:45:10,691 --> 00:45:14,778
They're on the leeward side, and the
levees are high. They should be fine.

295
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,864
OK. But right now, I need to get home.

296
00:45:18,366 --> 00:45:20,826
- You can't cross here.
- Take the mountain road.

297
00:45:24,038 --> 00:45:25,747
- Here we go, Sosuke.
- Sure.

298
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:29,835
- No! Don't do it!
- A big wave is coming!

299
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,427
- Lisa, you gotta get out of here!
- Back up!

300
00:46:19,468 --> 00:46:22,596
- The fish are following us now!
- Buckle up!

301
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,028
I'm gonna go real fast!

302
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:31,998
What a persistent wave!

303
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,719
- Lisa, the little girl just fell in!
- What?

304
00:47:44,804 --> 00:47:46,346
She was on a fish!

305
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,602
Where?

306
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:03,321
The sea level is raised!

307
00:48:03,406 --> 00:48:05,699
Sosuke,
where did you see a little girl?

308
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:08,576
She was out there,
running on top of a huge fish!

309
00:48:08,661 --> 00:48:09,828
A fish?

310
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,792
Sosuke, we have to go!

311
00:48:31,892 --> 00:48:34,853
Hang in there, Sosuke.
We're almost home.

312
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,202
There is a little girl.
It's dangerous out here!

313
00:49:32,286 --> 00:49:33,620
Come over here!

314
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:35,789
Stay there, Sosuke.

315
00:50:02,149 --> 00:50:04,150
Sosuke, do you know her?

316
00:50:25,673 --> 00:50:26,798
Ponyo?

317
00:50:27,842 --> 00:50:31,428
- Right! It's me, Ponyo!
- It is you!

318
00:50:33,472 --> 00:50:37,267
Lisa! Ponyo came back,
and she's a little girl now!

319
00:50:48,696 --> 00:50:50,613
I found Sosuke!

320
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:12,177
Listen, Sosuke, Ponyo.

321
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:15,472
All right.
Life is mysterious and amazing.

322
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,348
But we need to be calm right now.

323
00:51:17,433 --> 00:51:19,225
- All right?
- Yes.

324
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,310
Very good.

325
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:26,566
You can take off
your raincoat now, Sosuke.

326
00:51:27,067 --> 00:51:29,527
You are... barefoot, Ponyo.
Hold this for a sec.

327
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:36,326
Stay here, and I'll go get a towel.

328
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:54,719
Here, this way!

329
00:51:57,223 --> 00:51:59,015
It smells like you in here!

330
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,020
Ponyo!

331
00:52:08,901 --> 00:52:10,068
There, got ya.

332
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,362
Now, let's rub you down and dry you off.

333
00:52:16,617 --> 00:52:18,910
Ponyo, you have beautiful red hair.

334
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:26,251
- And your clothes are dry.
- That's because Ponyo was a fish.

335
00:52:26,335 --> 00:52:29,754
- Being wet doesn't bother her, right?
- Right.

336
00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:33,216
I really like this thing.

337
00:52:33,592 --> 00:52:36,719
All right then.
Why don't we have some tea?

338
00:52:37,012 --> 00:52:39,556
Ponyo, will you
hold the light for me?

339
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,393
- Coming!
- Let's see if the water is working.

340
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,520
- It's working!
- It's working!

341
00:52:49,024 --> 00:52:50,733
- It worked!
- It worked!

342
00:52:51,944 --> 00:52:54,612
It's because we have
our own water tank up on the hill.

343
00:52:56,448 --> 00:53:00,910
And who thinks the stove will light?
And light! All right.

344
00:53:00,995 --> 00:53:04,038
- All right!
- We have our own propane tank.

345
00:53:07,126 --> 00:53:10,837
- Please have a seat at the table.
- OK!

346
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,463
Ponyo, over here.

347
00:53:18,721 --> 00:53:20,179
This is what you do.

348
00:53:23,392 --> 00:53:24,934
Now, put your stuff down.

349
00:53:27,563 --> 00:53:30,898
- You need to use your hands.
- No, I'll use feet!

350
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:35,111
Look at that!

351
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,283
What is it?

352
00:53:40,576 --> 00:53:42,910
Look at her feet.
They're just like hands.

353
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:03,973
Here you go.

354
00:54:05,768 --> 00:54:06,768
Here.

355
00:54:11,899 --> 00:54:13,149
Thank you for the tea!

356
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:03,199
Ah, that was delicious.

357
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:07,370
So, what shall we do next?

358
00:55:07,788 --> 00:55:11,499
- Ponyo wants ham!
- All she thinks about is ham, Lisa.

359
00:55:13,252 --> 00:55:15,253
I better make some dinner then.

360
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:18,464
But, first,
we should start the generator.

361
00:55:19,758 --> 00:55:22,844
We generate power
to talk to Koichi on the radio.

362
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:26,639
Koichi is my dad.

363
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:29,642
- Is he an evil wizard?
- No, of course not.

364
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:32,395
He's the captain of the ship
called Koganei Maru.

365
00:55:32,479 --> 00:55:34,480
What about your dad, Ponyo?

366
00:55:34,982 --> 00:55:37,817
His name is Fujimoto.
He keeps me in a bubble!

367
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,862
- What?
- So I ran away.

368
00:55:42,656 --> 00:55:44,157
What about your mom, then?

369
00:55:44,658 --> 00:55:47,744
I love my mom very much!

370
00:55:48,203 --> 00:55:52,081
- But she can be very scary.
- Just like my mom.

371
00:55:57,254 --> 00:55:58,546
Ponyo, over here, please.

372
00:56:15,147 --> 00:56:17,857
I wonder if the fuel has gone bad.

373
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:20,985
- Maybe it's clogged.
- It's clogged.

374
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:22,904
It's clogged over there.

375
00:56:38,545 --> 00:56:41,297
- It's on!
- It's light now!

376
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:45,092
Ponyo, you're amazing.

377
00:57:03,403 --> 00:57:06,239
- Antenna, antenna!
- Hey, Lisa.

378
00:57:06,323 --> 00:57:08,366
Did all the ships out there sink?

379
00:57:09,743 --> 00:57:11,494
I don't see any lights out there.

380
00:57:29,805 --> 00:57:32,723
- Too loud!
- We can't get through?

381
00:57:33,976 --> 00:57:36,435
I can't get any reception.

382
00:57:37,563 --> 00:57:41,774
Transmitting from JA4LL. JA4LL.

383
00:57:42,109 --> 00:57:43,401
Come in, Koichi.

384
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:46,362
This is Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.

385
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:48,406
We're all doing fine.

386
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,828
- We're about to have dinner.
- Ham!

387
00:58:02,421 --> 00:58:05,548
Put the noodles in your bowl?
Be careful. It's really hot.

388
00:58:21,857 --> 00:58:25,192
- You have to wait a little bit.
- It takes three minutes.

389
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:41,834
OK, close your eyes.

390
00:58:43,045 --> 00:58:44,295
Not yet...

391
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,925
Ponyo... No peeking!

392
00:58:52,638 --> 00:58:54,430
OK. You can look now.

393
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:57,683
Abracadabra!

394
00:59:03,982 --> 00:59:06,651
- It's ham!
- Careful, it's hot.

395
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:10,863
Hot, hot, hot!

396
00:59:28,215 --> 00:59:29,966
Lisa, Ponyo fell asleep.

397
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:39,850
Do you think Ponyo
came from far, far away?

398
00:59:39,935 --> 00:59:41,602
Yeah, I do.

399
00:59:57,452 --> 01:00:00,162
Look outside. It looks like
the waves have calmed down.

400
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:04,625
- Maybe because Ponyo fell asleep.
- Do you see that light?

401
01:00:12,426 --> 01:00:15,428
It's moving.
There must be somebody still over there.

402
01:00:15,512 --> 01:00:17,513
I wonder if that's Yoshie
and the others.

403
01:00:24,104 --> 01:00:26,647
- The lights are out.
- It's the mountain road.

404
01:00:30,777 --> 01:00:32,695
Sosuke, stay with Ponyo, OK?

405
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,458
I've gotta go help them.

406
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:47,668
I can get there
if I take the mountain road.

407
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:53,466
Sosuke,
I should go to the senior center.

408
01:00:53,675 --> 01:00:54,842
I'm coming, too.

409
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:58,095
I'd feel better if you'd
stay up here with Ponyo.

410
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:01,682
I'm coming with you!
We just need to bring Ponyo with us.

411
01:01:02,184 --> 01:01:03,476
I wanna go with you, Lisa!

412
01:01:06,104 --> 01:01:09,940
Sosuke, right now,
our house is a beacon in the storm.

413
01:01:10,025 --> 01:01:14,153
The people in the dark feel hopeful
when they see our lights.

414
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,113
That's why someone has to be here.

415
01:01:17,115 --> 01:01:19,283
Many mysterious things
have been happening.

416
01:01:19,367 --> 01:01:23,621
We don't know why right now,
but we'll find out before long.

417
01:01:23,705 --> 01:01:26,874
For now, I'm worried about
the people at the senior center.

418
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:31,337
If you stay and guard the house,
that would be very helpful.

419
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:34,423
Don't worry. I promise I'll be back.

420
01:01:35,717 --> 01:01:37,426
Promise?

421
01:01:38,512 --> 01:01:41,514
- I promise.
- You promised.

422
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:43,933
I love you, Sosuke.

423
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:41,824
The moon is out! I can see
the lights of a city up ahead.

424
01:02:42,284 --> 01:02:45,244
Thank goodness!
We can get our bearings again.

425
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,663
We're someplace
I've never seen before.

426
01:02:53,753 --> 01:02:56,630
Have we arrived in America or what?

427
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:17,902
That's not a mountain.
And that's no harbor, either.

428
01:03:17,986 --> 01:03:19,361
Those lights are ships.

429
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:32,208
The water of the ocean has
come together to create a mountain.

430
01:03:32,918 --> 01:03:34,919
That's probably a graveyard for ships.

431
01:03:35,003 --> 01:03:37,254
The gate to the world beyond
must have opened!

432
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:45,429
- The engine stopped!
- Try to hold her steady.

433
01:03:45,513 --> 01:03:47,681
- Drop the sea anchor.
- Yes, sir.

434
01:04:01,488 --> 01:04:03,280
Something's coming from behind us.

435
01:04:31,268 --> 01:04:32,851
I just saw the Goddess of Mercy!

436
01:04:43,363 --> 01:04:45,990
- The engine's working.
- We're saved!

437
01:04:46,074 --> 01:04:49,243
She saved us!
She must've appeared for us!

438
01:04:49,327 --> 01:04:52,871
Thank you for protecting us...

439
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,525
Higher, higher.

440
01:05:35,248 --> 01:05:37,750
There is a powerful holy barrier
around the house.

441
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:40,169
How has she learned
to do something like that?

442
01:05:57,854 --> 01:06:00,939
I don't believe this!
She's turned into a human!

443
01:06:01,149 --> 01:06:04,735
Hold still! You... What are you doing?

444
01:06:12,786 --> 01:06:15,454
Girls! Oh, no!

445
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:19,833
Stop, now!

446
01:06:27,634 --> 01:06:30,552
Listen, girls.
I'm concerned about your sister.

447
01:06:36,393 --> 01:06:39,395
At last, she has finally come.

448
01:07:16,182 --> 01:07:19,309
- Fujimoto.
- You've come for me, my love.

449
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:22,146
What a wonderful ocean.

450
01:07:26,317 --> 01:07:31,321
It's full of magic and power.
It's like my ancient Devonian Sea.

451
01:07:31,823 --> 01:07:33,824
Ponyo has tasted human blood.

452
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:37,453
She also drank all of my elixirs
that I've collected.

453
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:41,665
Ponyo? What a lovely name.

454
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:49,423
Of course, it's all my fault, really.

455
01:07:50,008 --> 01:07:54,470
She can use magic freely, and she's
opened a hole in the fabric of reality.

456
01:07:54,554 --> 01:07:57,222
She has no idea what she's doing.

457
01:07:57,432 --> 01:08:02,978
She's now a little girl.
And she loves a little boy.

458
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:07,107
If we don't do anything about this,
the planet is doomed.

459
01:08:16,284 --> 01:08:19,244
Already the Earth
is pulling satellites from the sky.

460
01:08:19,329 --> 01:08:21,788
And the moon pulls the sea closer...

461
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:24,208
Be calm, dear.

462
01:08:31,966 --> 01:08:36,178
Sosuke. The boy's name is Sosuke.

463
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:43,352
You all love your older sister,
don't you?

464
01:08:46,648 --> 01:08:49,983
Listen, my darling, why don't
we let Ponyo become human for good?

465
01:08:50,068 --> 01:08:52,402
- What?
- It's the old magic, you know.

466
01:08:53,071 --> 01:08:55,280
If Sosuke's love remains unchanged,

467
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:57,866
Ponyo'll become human
and lose her magical power.

468
01:08:57,951 --> 01:09:02,579
But, if anything goes wrong,
Ponyo will turn into sea foam.

469
01:09:03,081 --> 01:09:06,625
Well, we all originated in sea foam.

470
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:09,628
But he is only five years old.
That's impossible...

471
01:09:15,134 --> 01:09:18,345
Children, sleep peacefully for now.

472
01:09:31,818 --> 01:09:35,904
Sosuke!

473
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:38,031
Ponyo, you OK?

474
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:45,414
- Ponyo, good morning.
- Good morning, Sosuke.

475
01:09:51,796 --> 01:09:53,922
Look at that.
The ocean is at our door.

476
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:21,867
- How come your Lisa's not here?
- Because the road is under the water.

477
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,369
Too bad we don't have a boat.

478
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:29,458
There's a boat, right there!

479
01:10:31,753 --> 01:10:34,171
- You can't ride it.
- Yes, you can.

480
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,688
Thank you!

481
01:10:53,566 --> 01:10:56,526
Wow! You even made the candle bigger.

482
01:10:56,611 --> 01:10:59,446
- We can ride it!
- Yeah! This is fantastic.

483
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:02,157
- Fantastic!
- You take that end, please.

484
01:11:02,241 --> 01:11:03,241
OK!

485
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:08,538
- Ready?
- I'm ready!

486
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:22,928
It actually floats!

487
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:27,933
Doesn't look like it has any leaks.

488
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:33,230
Now we have to fill the boiler.
The water goes in through this pipe...

489
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:36,733
...then it gets heated up here,
in this round thing.

490
01:12:04,178 --> 01:12:05,846
It's like a rocket.

491
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,813
Ponyo, everything's shipshape.

492
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:16,690
- Shipshape!
- Yep.

493
01:12:16,774 --> 01:12:19,151
- Shipshape!
- Shipshape.

494
01:12:19,235 --> 01:12:22,654
Shipshape! Shipshape!
Shipshape! Shipshape!

495
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:23,739
Shipshape!

496
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:47,137
Is it hot? It's hot!

497
01:12:52,351 --> 01:12:53,435
Hot!

498
01:12:57,148 --> 01:12:59,816
- Look at that!
- It's burning.

499
01:12:59,901 --> 01:13:02,986
It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot!

500
01:13:10,995 --> 01:13:12,621
It's hot, right?

501
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:24,966
It's working!

502
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:29,429
Sosuke, we're shipshape, right?

503
01:13:29,514 --> 01:13:31,431
- Yep.
- This is fantastic.

504
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:41,817
- Sosuke! We're happy, right?
- Yep.

505
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,153
- Sosuke, it's burning, right?
- Yep.

506
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:47,739
Sosuke, that thing is hot, right?

507
01:13:48,533 --> 01:13:52,202
Ponyo, you be the boat's lookout.
And I'll do the steering, OK?

508
01:13:52,745 --> 01:13:54,454
OK! I'm the lookout!

509
01:14:21,524 --> 01:14:22,774
There's the road.

510
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:25,193
That's the mountain road
Lisa took last night.

511
01:14:27,697 --> 01:14:30,532
- I don't see her anywhere.
- We'll see her.

512
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:32,993
She promised me she'd come back.

513
01:14:37,874 --> 01:14:41,251
Those are ancient fish.
They lived during the Devonian Age.

514
01:14:41,335 --> 01:14:44,045
I know that one.
It's Bothriocephalus.

515
01:14:48,634 --> 01:14:51,052
- And that one is...
- Dipnorhynchus.

516
01:14:51,137 --> 01:14:55,181
- Dipnorhynchus!
- Wow! That one's really huge!

517
01:14:55,266 --> 01:14:58,143
- That's Devonynchus!
- Devonynchus!

518
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:10,155
Ahoy!

519
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,198
- Ahoy...
- Whoa, there's a boat!

520
01:15:13,284 --> 01:15:14,910
Ahoy!

521
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:17,579
They said, "Ahoy."

522
01:15:18,998 --> 01:15:20,916
Ahoy!

523
01:15:26,797 --> 01:15:27,881
That's fast!

524
01:15:31,177 --> 01:15:32,594
I'm getting the hang of this.

525
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:37,933
Get ready to stop, Ponyo.

526
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:46,274
- Hello, you two.
- Hello.

527
01:15:46,359 --> 01:15:48,902
Hey, that is quite
a boat you got there.

528
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:52,322
I've seen you before.
You're Lisa's little boy, aren't you?

529
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:56,326
- He's not a little boy. He's Sosuke!
- She's Ponyo.

530
01:15:57,787 --> 01:15:59,955
And I used to be a fish.

531
01:16:00,331 --> 01:16:01,623
A fish?

532
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:04,459
Your name is lovely, Ponyo.

533
01:16:06,796 --> 01:16:08,838
By the way, have you seen my mother?

534
01:16:08,923 --> 01:16:12,467
Your mother?
Why isn't your mother with you?

535
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:15,845
- She went to the senior center.
- Wow, way up there?

536
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:17,472
This is our baby.

537
01:16:47,503 --> 01:16:49,504
Oh, dear. I wonder what's wrong.

538
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:57,846
Oh, is that for us?

539
01:17:11,527 --> 01:17:13,028
Let me have it.

540
01:17:17,992 --> 01:17:21,327
Thank you.
I'm looking forward to tasting it.

541
01:17:24,749 --> 01:17:27,083
Wow, that's good soup.

542
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:31,337
- My mom made it.
- The soup's for the baby!

543
01:17:32,131 --> 01:17:34,090
Oh, I'm sorry.

544
01:17:34,175 --> 01:17:39,137
He's too young to have soup.
But I could eat the soup instead,

545
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:41,389
and it would help me make milk for him.

546
01:17:43,601 --> 01:17:45,894
Yeah, my mom made milk for me, too.

547
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:49,731
Ponyo, is it all right
if I eat the soup?

548
01:17:49,815 --> 01:17:53,068
- That's fine.
- Thank you.

549
01:17:54,361 --> 01:17:55,862
Heave-ho!

550
01:17:57,114 --> 01:18:00,992
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

551
01:18:02,828 --> 01:18:04,329
Heave-ho!

552
01:18:10,961 --> 01:18:14,422
People from the town!
It's just like a parade!

553
01:18:14,799 --> 01:18:19,385
Ahoy! Are any of you in need
of assistance at this time?

554
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:24,599
Thank you! We're fine for now!

555
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:27,936
We are taking everyone
to the Mountain Peak Hotel!

556
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:30,730
For your safety,
we request that you follow us!

557
01:18:30,815 --> 01:18:33,108
Aye, aye! Will do!

558
01:18:35,402 --> 01:18:38,196
- Looks like the whole town is here.
- I'm glad.

559
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,241
- I hope everyone's OK.
- Ponyo, time to light the candle.

560
01:18:41,325 --> 01:18:43,326
Hold on a second. Let's see...

561
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:50,416
Here, have some milk.

562
01:18:51,001 --> 01:18:52,001
Wow.

563
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:54,546
It's for milk.

564
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:57,173
She already ate all the ham
off those sandwiches.

565
01:18:57,258 --> 01:19:00,343
Thank you. It'll help me make good milk.

566
01:19:00,427 --> 01:19:01,427
Sosuke.

567
01:19:02,096 --> 01:19:07,308
- I have a used candle. Do you want it?
- Thanks. Ponyo will make it bigger.

568
01:19:07,393 --> 01:19:08,393
Thank you!

569
01:19:09,228 --> 01:19:11,146
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

570
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:18,945
What's the matter?

571
01:19:23,868 --> 01:19:24,868
There. There.

572
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:45,722
Ponyo!

573
01:19:58,986 --> 01:20:01,696
- Sosuke!
- Hey, that's Sosuke.

574
01:20:02,489 --> 01:20:05,241
- Where is Lisa?
- What's going on with Lisa?

575
01:20:05,326 --> 01:20:08,703
She went to the senior center last
night! We're on our way to find her!

576
01:20:08,787 --> 01:20:11,998
That means Lisa beat that wave!

577
01:20:12,082 --> 01:20:15,210
- That's Lisa.
- Sosuke, can I ride with you?

578
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:18,588
Kumiko, I'm busy right now. Maybe later.

579
01:20:18,672 --> 01:20:22,300
Check the park.
The seniors should be there by now.

580
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,636
- Good luck, kid!
- You'll find her!

581
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:29,265
We'll send a boat for the seniors
as soon as we drop this group off!

582
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:31,226
Good luck, captain!

583
01:21:20,192 --> 01:21:22,944
Ponyo, we need to replace the candle.

584
01:21:26,782 --> 01:21:29,951
We'll be OK.
The fisherman gave me another one.

585
01:21:30,995 --> 01:21:31,995
Hot!

586
01:21:32,413 --> 01:21:33,788
It's still pretty hot.

587
01:21:38,961 --> 01:21:41,170
Bye-bye.

588
01:21:42,506 --> 01:21:45,633
Here, Ponyo.
Can you make this bigger?

589
01:21:46,051 --> 01:21:47,176
All right.

590
01:21:53,142 --> 01:21:55,977
Ponyo, are you sleepy?

591
01:22:03,068 --> 01:22:04,110
Ponyo.

592
01:22:20,294 --> 01:22:22,003
Ponyo. Ponyo!

593
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:22,021
Oh, good. I can walk from here.

594
01:23:48,882 --> 01:23:50,091
There's the road.

595
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,105
Oh, no! The boat!

596
01:24:05,899 --> 01:24:27,962
Ponyo!

597
01:24:29,131 --> 01:24:31,174
Ponyo, wake up!

598
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:35,094
Sosuke.

599
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,144
You scared me.

600
01:24:43,228 --> 01:24:45,813
I thought you might
turn back into a goldfish.

601
01:24:58,619 --> 01:25:01,913
Lisa's car!
Ponyo, I found Lisa's car!

602
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:08,628
Lisa! Lisa!

603
01:25:11,173 --> 01:25:21,349
Lisa!

604
01:25:23,101 --> 01:25:24,101
Lisa...

605
01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:27,355
Lisa.

606
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:36,697
Lisa!

607
01:26:05,227 --> 01:26:07,603
Sosuke, I've got your boat.

608
01:26:07,688 --> 01:26:10,398
There's water coming from your eyes.

609
01:26:17,281 --> 01:26:20,241
- Let's go find your mom.
- Yeah.

610
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:04,452
HIMAWARI HOUSE

611
01:27:06,538 --> 01:27:09,457
- My lap blanket!
- Forget about it!

612
01:27:09,541 --> 01:27:11,959
Look, here comes a whale again!

613
01:27:12,044 --> 01:27:13,753
I think he sees us.

614
01:27:13,837 --> 01:27:15,755
The other side is nice, isn't it?

615
01:27:15,839 --> 01:27:18,799
- And my knees don't hurt.
- We didn't have to be afraid.

616
01:27:18,884 --> 01:27:21,677
This is the other side?
I thought it was the undersea palace!

617
01:27:24,348 --> 01:27:27,475
Ladies, can we gather around, please?

618
01:27:27,559 --> 01:27:30,645
- Coming!
- Let's go!

619
01:27:33,357 --> 01:27:36,442
- It's so nice to run.
- Beat you there!

620
01:27:40,697 --> 01:27:41,989
Winner!

621
01:27:47,496 --> 01:27:49,246
Everyone, quiet, please.

622
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:55,252
The time has come for you to bear
witness to a sacred test of love.

623
01:27:55,337 --> 01:27:58,255
- Oh, how exciting!
- Test of love!

624
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:00,132
My heart is beating fast!

625
01:28:02,386 --> 01:28:06,430
Please, ladies! You're the witnesses
to this sacred test.

626
01:28:06,515 --> 01:28:09,016
We ask everyone to be patient
for a little while longer.

627
01:28:10,394 --> 01:28:14,730
Fujimoto, you won't let any harm
come to Sosuke or Ponyo, will you?

628
01:28:14,815 --> 01:28:17,983
- Right.
- Of course not! He's the father...

629
01:28:18,068 --> 01:28:19,151
Of course I wouldn't.

630
01:28:20,529 --> 01:28:23,322
My hope is Ponyo will stay asleep.
Excuse me.

631
01:28:32,624 --> 01:28:37,461
- I'm sure he's nice at heart.
- I wonder how Lisa's doing?

632
01:28:37,546 --> 01:28:42,341
She's with Ponyo's mother, and
they've been talking all night and day.

633
01:28:50,392 --> 01:28:52,977
Poor Lisa. Must be hard on her.

634
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:55,813
I wish we could hear
what they're talking about.

635
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:58,482
Oh, why don't we just ask. Lisa!

636
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:01,902
Lisa!

637
01:29:07,367 --> 01:29:09,285
Please know that we are all

638
01:29:09,369 --> 01:29:13,956
cheering for Sosuke and Ponyo!

639
01:29:27,763 --> 01:29:30,306
- Lisa!
- You must be anxious.

640
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:32,850
Sosuke'll do just fine.
He's a determined, young boy.

641
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:33,934
Absolutely!

642
01:29:34,019 --> 01:29:35,394
He's such an upstanding boy.

643
01:29:36,313 --> 01:29:39,190
Thank you.
Please be there for him.

644
01:29:39,274 --> 01:29:40,858
It's going to be fine.

645
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:50,367
Ponyo, there's a tunnel.

646
01:29:50,911 --> 01:29:52,912
MOUNTAIN PEAK PARK AHEAD

647
01:29:54,581 --> 01:29:57,625
STOP

648
01:30:06,051 --> 01:30:07,968
I think I've been here before.

649
01:30:09,471 --> 01:30:13,098
- Ponyo?
- Don't like this place.

650
01:30:17,145 --> 01:30:20,523
- Don't let go of my hand.
- OK.

651
01:30:57,102 --> 01:31:27,923
Ponyo!

652
01:31:49,905 --> 01:31:53,741
Ponyo! Please don't die! Ponyo!

653
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:57,536
Ponyo! Wake up, Ponyo!

654
01:31:58,705 --> 01:32:00,247
Be careful not to wake her.

655
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:05,002
It's good to meet you, Sosuke.
We've all been waiting for you.

656
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:08,797
- The old ladies, your mother...
- My mother?

657
01:32:08,882 --> 01:32:12,468
Won't you come with me
and join them, Sosuke? Ponyo, too.

658
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:18,182
Let Ponyo keep sleeping
and we'll just sneak away.

659
01:32:18,266 --> 01:32:23,604
Sosuke! Sosuke,
don't listen to that wacko!

660
01:32:24,147 --> 01:32:27,399
He tricked all the others
into going with him!

661
01:32:27,484 --> 01:32:30,444
- Toki!
- Nobody fools me!

662
01:32:31,237 --> 01:32:34,406
Like I said, there is so little time!

663
01:32:35,075 --> 01:32:36,784
Can't you see that?

664
01:32:36,868 --> 01:32:40,371
If the moon comes any closer,
there will be no going back!

665
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:43,791
If you're gonna lie,
come up with a better one!

666
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:46,543
- Sosuke, come to me!
- Humans!

667
01:32:46,795 --> 01:32:48,712
Listen, Sosuke, please come with me!

668
01:32:48,797 --> 01:32:50,881
You're the only one
who can save the planet.

669
01:32:50,966 --> 01:32:52,466
I don't want to use force.

670
01:32:53,802 --> 01:32:54,927
Ponyo!

671
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:59,306
What a horrible thing to do
to your father!

672
01:33:06,022 --> 01:33:10,150
- Ponyo!
- Sosuke, come on!

673
01:33:10,235 --> 01:33:11,777
Bring them to me!

674
01:33:17,492 --> 01:33:18,826
You can do it!

675
01:33:21,246 --> 01:33:22,746
Jump for it!

676
01:34:02,287 --> 01:34:03,328
Girls!

677
01:34:58,510 --> 01:35:00,636
- Lisa!
- Sosuke.

678
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:01,762
Ponyo!

679
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:10,562
Where am I?

680
01:35:20,782 --> 01:35:24,576
- So this is Sosuke.
- How do you do?

681
01:35:24,661 --> 01:35:27,704
- Are you Ponyo's mother?
- Yes.

682
01:35:27,789 --> 01:35:32,709
You brought my daughter
safely here. Thank you.

683
01:35:33,461 --> 01:35:34,753
Sosuke.

684
01:35:34,838 --> 01:35:38,799
Ponyo opened a magic well because
she wants very much to be human.

685
01:35:39,801 --> 01:35:41,301
For her to become human,

686
01:35:41,386 --> 01:35:46,557
she needs you to accept
and love her as she truly is.

687
01:35:47,267 --> 01:35:51,478
You know that Ponyo was a fish,
don't you?

688
01:35:52,814 --> 01:35:56,608
She became half human
when she licked your blood.

689
01:35:56,693 --> 01:36:01,321
Oh, I see... I cut my thumb,
then Ponyo licked it and made it better.

690
01:36:01,406 --> 01:36:03,991
So that's how she changed into a human.

691
01:36:04,951 --> 01:36:08,620
Do you care if Ponyo
is half fish and half human?

692
01:36:09,038 --> 01:36:11,248
I love Ponyo as a fish,

693
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:15,419
half-fish and fully human.
I love her in all forms.

694
01:36:29,767 --> 01:36:32,060
Ponyo, come here, please.

695
01:36:46,576 --> 01:36:51,205
Ponyo, Sosuke will be your guardian.

696
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,669
To become human,
you must choose to abandon magic.

697
01:36:57,754 --> 01:36:59,379
Can you do that?

698
01:37:00,173 --> 01:37:01,173
Yes!

699
01:37:10,058 --> 01:37:13,352
Kiss the bubble,
when you return to land,

700
01:37:13,436 --> 01:37:17,856
and Ponyo will become a girl.
Five years old, just like you.

701
01:37:21,110 --> 01:37:23,111
I'm happy for you, Ponyo.

702
01:37:24,072 --> 01:37:26,615
Thank you very much, Ponyo's mother.

703
01:37:32,622 --> 01:37:36,291
Everyone,
the balance of nature is restored.

704
01:37:39,754 --> 01:37:41,463
Way to go!

705
01:37:47,262 --> 01:37:48,762
My Sosuke.

706
01:38:13,288 --> 01:38:15,122
Thank you, Lisa.

707
01:38:15,415 --> 01:38:18,292
Thank you. I'll take care of her.

708
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:32,472
Everyone! Are you all right?

709
01:38:37,979 --> 01:38:42,316
- Wait, let me get your wheelchairs!
- Don't bother. We like to walk.

710
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,276
Life begins again.

711
01:38:47,822 --> 01:38:49,698
This is your ship, I believe.

712
01:38:52,076 --> 01:38:56,538
- Thank you.
- Sorry for everything.

713
01:38:56,622 --> 01:38:57,789
If you will. May I?

714
01:39:03,338 --> 01:39:05,005
Take care of Ponyo.

715
01:39:07,759 --> 01:39:09,259
It's Koichi's ship!

716
01:39:13,931 --> 01:39:19,227
Koichi! Hi! Over here!

717
01:39:19,312 --> 01:39:22,731
It's Lisa! And Sosuke's there, too!

718
01:39:23,149 --> 01:39:24,816
Ahoy!

719
01:39:24,901 --> 01:39:27,819
Look, Ponyo, there's Koichi's ship!

720
01:41:12,425 --> 01:41:18,430
THE END
