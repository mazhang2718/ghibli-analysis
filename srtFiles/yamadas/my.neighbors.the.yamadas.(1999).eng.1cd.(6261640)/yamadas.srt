1
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:20,446
This is the sun, this is the moon,

2
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:23,886
this mountain is really the earth,

3
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:30,526
and this is grandma.

4
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:54,516
My how splendid...

5
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,786
Hello, Mrs. Yamada.

6
00:00:58,156 --> 00:01:01,926
I've never seen such a magnificent...

7
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:04,996
Yup, they're my little babies.

8
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:06,586
What species?

9
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:09,536
This is a Mino Chrysanthemum, this is...

10
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,736
No, I mean the caterpillar.

11
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,176
No idea.

12
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:21,876
Grow into a butterfly just as gaudy as that flower.

13
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:27,356
Mother!

14
00:01:28,386 --> 00:01:30,826
That's our grandma.

15
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:44,766
And my mother and me, Nonoko.

16
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:48,906
What am I going to make for dinner tonight...

17
00:01:52,276 --> 00:01:55,946
I know, I'll go for it! Something really special!

18
00:01:56,056 --> 00:01:57,346
What are we having?

19
00:01:57,686 --> 00:02:00,216
We had curry last week. Curry two days ago.

20
00:02:00,356 --> 00:02:02,616
Tonight... Curry!!

21
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:03,786
What...

22
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:18,566
And this is my father and my older brother.

23
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:22,266
What's the use of all this studying, Dad?

24
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:24,936
Listen, Noboru.

25
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,646
Studying is not about what's useful or not.

26
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:33,416
The studying that seems useless may turn out to be useful.

27
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:35,986
On the other hand, it might be that

28
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,886
studying that doesn't seem not useful may not be,

29
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:43,426
but then studying that seems useless may then be useful.

30
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,626
But when you really need it,
it's not about useful or useless...

31
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:50,796
What are you going on about?

32
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:56,136
So I still have to study.

33
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:06,786
MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS

34
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:14,756
MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS

35
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:28,076
I get it...

36
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:32,576
If my father had been smart and really cool,

37
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:36,686
and my mother had been gorgeous and a great cook,

38
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:42,856
and our family had been rich, my whole life would've been different.

39
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:49,086
If at least one of them...

40
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,566
Don't be ridiculous.

41
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:55,796
If we hadn't married, there'd be no you, and no Nonoko.

42
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:59,196
Without the two of us, you wouldn't be here.

43
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,706
No, that's wrong.

44
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:06,206
If I had cooler parents, I'd just be their kid.

45
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:07,716
How stupid.

46
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:11,616
Don't you know about stamens and pistils?

47
00:04:11,716 --> 00:04:12,706
You tell him.

48
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:14,516
You can't choose your parents.

49
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:19,116
No, I can't accept that. Something's not right.

50
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:23,396
Because I'm me, Dad's Dad and Mom's Mom.

51
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,596
What is that supposed to mean?

52
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:29,756
Who am I?

53
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:32,836
Where did I come from?

54
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:35,376
Where am I?

55
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:37,866
Who am I?

56
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,076
I get it...

57
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:45,986
So, there was a time when Dad and Mom weren't married.

58
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:14,916
Takashi and Matsuko are off to a great start in their new life.

59
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:17,646
Let's give them a warm send-off.

60
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:23,686
Congratulations, Takashi and Matsuko.

61
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:29,926
I also offer warm wishes to their parents and relatives.

62
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:40,966
Now, your prospects are boundless,

63
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:46,176
and you're embarking for the wide open world, under billowing sails.

64
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:03,086
Life, as they say, has its ups and downs.

65
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:08,436
At times, the waves may taunt you, tossing you in their swells.

66
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,926
But take heart.

67
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:15,606
It's hard to stick with it and make it on your own,

68
00:06:16,246 --> 00:06:21,576
but even a couple of losers
can survive most things if they're together.

69
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:30,886
So listen, take my advice
and have children as soon as you can.

70
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:37,396
Children are the best reason for riding out life's storms.

71
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:51,936
Nowadays people say child-rearing
is challenging and difficult,

72
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:54,736
but we've done it from time immemorial.

73
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:58,206
Children grow even without parents.

74
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:05,216
So hold them close to your heart as they crawl,
then walk. They'll be fine.

75
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:19,096
Children make you appreciate your own parents.

76
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,896
Parents may seem to do nothing but order you around,

77
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:27,136
but they'll baby-sit your kids
and sometimes give them toys.

78
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,306
Nowadays young people

79
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:35,936
turn that saying about appreciating parents
to their own advantage.

80
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:39,316
But I guess that's part of it too.

81
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:45,256
If things work out, you even get the real estate.

82
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:50,796
So Matsuko and Takashi,

83
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:53,996
start looking after your folks!

84
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:57,566
I hope you know the land is in my name.

85
00:08:57,676 --> 00:09:01,076
Excuse me, mother, but I built this house.

86
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:03,576
Without land, there's no house.

87
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,666
And we are grateful to you,

88
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:09,116
but I've worked hard, too.

89
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,916
Your room gets the best light.

90
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:13,616
Thanks for nothing.

91
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:17,746
Of course it does. It's on my land.

92
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:22,126
Besides, why do you always insist
you built it by yourself.

93
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:25,526
I hate to contradict you, but I definitely built...

94
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:27,866
That's enough!

95
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:29,436
Both of you.

96
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:33,196
That's right! What's the point of all this bickering!

97
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,836
Listen to Noboru.

98
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:37,036
In the end, it'll all be mine.

99
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:06,396
And what should you fear most on this lifelong voyage?

100
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,276
Wild storms and rip tides?

101
00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:21,676
No. Beware the calm waters,
when there's hardly a ripple in sight.

102
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:26,556
As long as a family holds each other tight, they can somehow

103
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:28,926
weather the wildest seas.

104
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:31,226
But calm waters are another story.

105
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:37,796
The wind dies down, you sigh and relax, loosening your clasp.

106
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:41,276
But take care, Matsuko and Takashi!

107
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:49,116
If in the calm you selfishly please only yourselves,
you may lose each other.

108
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:57,546
You'll never see the sharks gathering around you.

109
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:06,226
And how will you guide your ship?

110
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,696
Without a wind, or even a course?

111
00:11:10,906 --> 00:11:14,236
If you row blindly, right, no, left,

112
00:11:14,346 --> 00:11:19,176
no, right after all, you'll never agree.

113
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:24,106
You may even wonder why you're stuck on the same boat at all.

114
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:27,446
Your family's about to fall apart.

115
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:29,386
Turn right there!

116
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:30,426
You sure?

117
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:31,626
Turn left!

118
00:11:31,726 --> 00:11:33,786
Right, right! No, left, left!

119
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:34,886
Which way!

120
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:36,556
Oh dear, maybe right.

121
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,186
Which is it!!??

122
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:48,876
We came so close...

123
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:50,066
Our turn!

124
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,466
A Family Crisis

125
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:02,016
Oh, no, this isn't the way.

126
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:03,586
You should've turned!

127
00:12:03,696 --> 00:12:05,086
No, no, go straight!

128
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:07,496
No, it's that way, are you crazy?

129
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,226
It's this way, Dad!

130
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:11,766
Quiet! All of you.

131
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:15,236
Nonoko's the only one who's quiet.

132
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,366
Hm...she's not here.

133
00:12:20,346 --> 00:12:21,436
What?

134
00:12:21,946 --> 00:12:23,346
Where is she?

135
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:25,376
Stop the car.

136
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:32,386
Where did we lose her?

137
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,886
Noboru, weren't you with her?

138
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:39,526
Yeah, while Dad and I were waiting for you.

139
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:42,596
Maybe she got bored and wandered off.

140
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:45,186
No, I remember her on the bench.

141
00:12:51,406 --> 00:12:53,306
I'm so sorry.

142
00:12:55,076 --> 00:12:57,206
What took you so long?

143
00:12:57,316 --> 00:13:00,146
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

144
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,576
I could have done some shopping, too.

145
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:05,546
I wanted to look at baseball bats.

146
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:13,156
I'm sure she's still there.

147
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:23,836
It's all because you kept yelling about how late we were.

148
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:27,166
Don't blame me. You're the ones who were late.

149
00:13:27,276 --> 00:13:32,676
You all got so excited, you just left poor Nonoko behind.

150
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:36,076
Like you weren't there yourself, grandma.

151
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:39,316
We were looking for your flannel underwear!

152
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,446
The store'll close. I'll never make it.

153
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,926
Stop thinking about yourself.

154
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:48,116
What if something terrible happens to Nonoko?

155
00:13:48,696 --> 00:13:50,186
Something terrible?

156
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:53,626
You don't mean...kidnapped!

157
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:58,636
She's so adorable, just like me.

158
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:02,766
This is no time for jokes!

159
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,166
If only that would work now.

160
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:08,546
What do you mean, that?

161
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:10,376
The PTA mantra.

162
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:14,776
'Don't talk to strangers.'

163
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:17,886
That's what you teach children?

164
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:21,486
It's like saying all strangers are thieves.

165
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:24,066
Nonoko's fine. Those teeth!

166
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:28,036
Hey, cake! Gimmee some!

167
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:30,166
Just one bite.

168
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,396
OK!

169
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,866
One chomp of those teeth!

170
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:36,036
Enough!

171
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:44,246
Please move, our daughter may have been kidnapped!

172
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:49,626
We can't even call.

173
00:14:49,726 --> 00:14:52,386
We should've called before.

174
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:54,056
I told you to buy a cell phone.

175
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,926
You keep quiet!

176
00:14:57,766 --> 00:15:00,926
Oh, Nonoko!

177
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,856
Are you lost?

178
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:33,696
Huh, so you're waiting for someone?

179
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:43,336
Who are you waiting for?

180
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:46,876
Can't you talk?

181
00:15:47,786 --> 00:15:50,046
Then why don't you say anything?

182
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:55,686
I'm not s'pposed to people I don't know.

183
00:15:55,986 --> 00:16:01,856
I know,'Don't talk to strangers.'

184
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:09,266
You're very grown-up, because you're careful.
You can talk now.

185
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,666
You should hear my story.

186
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:16,836
My father and mother and grandma and brother all got lost.

187
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,146
Did you lose someone?

188
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,146
My mommy.

189
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:23,786
Your mommy?

190
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:27,886
My mommy went away...

191
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:32,186
I know...there've been a lot of missing parents lately...

192
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:36,426
But it's only your mom, you'll find her.

193
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:45,236
Excuse me, this is Toshio Kimura.

194
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,436
Can you please call his mom?

195
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,536
Oh, he's lost?

196
00:16:48,646 --> 00:16:51,046
No he's not, they were separated.

197
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,316
Right.

198
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:57,816
And your first name, Mr. Kimura?

199
00:16:57,986 --> 00:16:59,046
- Toshio. - Toshio.

200
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:00,616
Toshio, then.

201
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:03,916
Wait here a minute, OK?

202
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:09,056
And you? Are you his sister?

203
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:10,916
No, no relation.

204
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:14,056
My whole family's lost.

205
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:32,676
Poor little, poor little, lost pussy cat...

206
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,356
Stop crying, we're here.

207
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:14,256
What! She went with her mother!?!

208
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:16,456
I'm her mother!

209
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:18,196
Oh, is that so?

210
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:21,356
How dare you give her to a stranger!

211
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:25,096
It may not have been her mother, but she was no stranger.

212
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:27,676
No stranger? Who could it be?

213
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:29,336
I don't know anyone...

214
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,876
Someone pretending to be friendly...

215
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:38,016
No, she recognized Nonoko.

216
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,146
That wasn't her mother!

217
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:41,446
Calm down! And then?

218
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:44,586
I'm terribly sorry.

219
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:50,896
Nonoko went off happily with someone
who seemed like her mother.

220
00:18:51,636 --> 00:18:54,156
Oh no... Who can it be...

221
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:56,636
Will you please page Nonoko?

222
00:18:56,806 --> 00:19:00,296
Actually...they went out that exit together.

223
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,236
Not here.

224
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:02,206
Come on!

225
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,976
That's some family...

226
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:21,696
Dad, where are you racing off to?

227
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:22,956
We're chasing it!

228
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:23,756
What?

229
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:26,266
The car Nonoko's in!

230
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,696
What kind of car?

231
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:36,966
We don't even know which way it went!

232
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:40,936
She'll be fine. Nonoko knew the lady, right?

233
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,076
I bet she took her home.

234
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:45,986
I'm sure Noboru's right.

235
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:49,716
Sure, that must be it.

236
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:53,016
Don't be so sure. You can't trust anyone these days.

237
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:54,356
Mother!

238
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:57,866
Don't you think you should notify the police?

239
00:19:57,966 --> 00:19:59,026
The police!

240
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:00,966
How would we explain?

241
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:03,426
Make a full confession.

242
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:04,436
Confession!

243
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:09,606
That four grown people
neglected and abandoned a young girl.

244
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,176
Say, does Nonoko have a key?

245
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:15,536
Let's go home!

246
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,376
Nonoko!

247
00:20:49,646 --> 00:20:53,386
Nonoko!

248
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:54,876
Nonoko!

249
00:20:58,726 --> 00:20:59,746
Nonoko!

250
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,356
Not here.

251
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:07,336
Of course not, it was locked.

252
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:13,736
Hello.

253
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:17,976
Oh, thank goodness!

254
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:21,446
Thank you! Thank you so much!

255
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:26,546
Thank you! We were looking everywhere for her.

256
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:29,216
I'm so sorry for all this...

257
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:34,896
Yes, we'll be right over.

258
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:38,396
You even made her dinner...

259
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:44,596
You're so very kind, how can we possibly thank you...

260
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:52,606
They finally got home.

261
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:55,306
They're coming right over.

262
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,976
I'm sorry, auntie.

263
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,386
Oh, it's nothing.

264
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:04,386
I can't wait to hear their side of the story.

265
00:22:23,046 --> 00:22:27,606
Look up and see, the blue skies,

266
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:31,446
the white clouds

267
00:22:31,886 --> 00:22:37,556
One of these days, it'll all work out

268
00:22:59,716 --> 00:23:02,646
- Next stop Luncheon Court.

269
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:16,026
What did you call this stop?

270
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,756
Can you stand back, ma'am?

271
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:24,906
Home Economics Wizard

272
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:27,896
Oh, dear, it started raining.

273
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,316
The laundry!

274
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:42,546
Huh?

275
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:50,126
What's the fuss?

276
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:57,966
That's right! I'd already brought it in.

277
00:23:58,076 --> 00:24:00,126
You never even hung it up!

278
00:24:01,846 --> 00:24:05,076
I'm going out. Can I get you anything?

279
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,776
Oh! There was something...

280
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:12,886
What was it... Um...um...

281
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,716
OK, then, I'm going.

282
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:22,926
It's just that, oh, what was it...

283
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:36,266
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

284
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:38,076
What is it!

285
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,816
Um, that is, um...

286
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,516
Why don't you just give up!

287
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:50,216
Oh, bread!

288
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:55,766
Get it yourself!

289
00:24:56,466 --> 00:24:58,086
Mom!

290
00:24:59,536 --> 00:25:01,096
Money, money.

291
00:25:02,606 --> 00:25:03,896
I'm home.

292
00:25:05,736 --> 00:25:08,136
I guess Mom's not here.

293
00:25:10,306 --> 00:25:11,746
Wow, noodles.

294
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:14,106
And the water's boiling.

295
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:17,446
Great, I'll go ahead and eat'em.

296
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,986
Oh, you're home.

297
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:37,766
You were hiding!

298
00:25:42,746 --> 00:25:43,646
Say.

299
00:25:45,516 --> 00:25:47,106
The bulb's out.

300
00:25:47,716 --> 00:25:50,276
That's no good. Better change it.

301
00:25:51,686 --> 00:25:54,746
Oh, darn...no spares.

302
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:58,016
Just switch it with one you don't use.

303
00:26:00,056 --> 00:26:01,496
Up we go.

304
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:06,556
I'm just borrowing it...

305
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,426
Ouch, it's hot.

306
00:26:12,436 --> 00:26:13,736
Tea.

307
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:14,936
Me, too.

308
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:16,006
Me, too.

309
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:20,146
I'm busy washing the dishes.
Get in here one of you!

310
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:24,976
paper scissors rock

311
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,286
Get your cup out.

312
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:38,856
The dishes are all yours.

313
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,396
What!

314
00:26:41,606 --> 00:26:43,766
Mr. Tanaka says he's coming over.

315
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:46,036
What! Oh, no.

316
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:51,416
Better tidy up a little.

317
00:26:56,886 --> 00:26:57,786
Ouch.

318
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:11,956
Hey, what are you doing?

319
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:14,366
I'll say we're spring cleaning!

320
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,476
Marriage Yamada Style

321
00:27:27,276 --> 00:27:29,476
It's on the kitchen table.

322
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:32,986
No, it's not.

323
00:27:33,456 --> 00:27:35,686
Are you sure? I know I left it.

324
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:37,556
It isn't here.

325
00:27:38,126 --> 00:27:39,856
Where did you look?

326
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:43,086
It's a manila envelope that says OKK in red.

327
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:45,226
Is this it, sir?

328
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,836
Oh, uh...OK. Well,

329
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,636
if it's gone, it's gone.

330
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:55,906
Hey.

331
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:57,176
Here.

332
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,766
That's 20 years of marriage for you.

333
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:01,176
Gimme the paper.

334
00:28:01,286 --> 00:28:02,976
When I'm done.

335
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,416
Impressive.

336
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,686
Can you pick up a few things?

337
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:17,666
Sure.

338
00:28:17,936 --> 00:28:22,736
Lettuce, cucumber, ham, light bulbs and garbage bags.

339
00:28:23,106 --> 00:28:24,436
I'll make a list.

340
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,836
No, I've got it.

341
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:32,776
Lettuce, cucumber, ham,

342
00:28:33,346 --> 00:28:35,476
light bulbs and garbage bags, right?

343
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:36,906
I told you.

344
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,616
It's not exactly like I forgot.

345
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:44,486
Lettuce...cucumber...

346
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:52,226
Let's see...

347
00:28:54,306 --> 00:28:55,466
Make up your mind.

348
00:28:55,806 --> 00:28:58,206
Have you decided?

349
00:28:58,506 --> 00:29:00,476
Just hurry up.

350
00:29:03,906 --> 00:29:05,846
I'll take the Shanghai Special.

351
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:07,176
Me too.

352
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,576
Two Shanghai Specials.

353
00:29:15,456 --> 00:29:17,856
Oh, you're still here?

354
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,546
What do you mean,'still'?

355
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:22,426
Can't I rest on my day off?

356
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:25,426
Usually, you're off at Pachinko.

357
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:29,236
Nope, I'm giving it a rest. How about some tea?

358
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:32,336
And noodles for lunch.

359
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:33,836
Yes, dear.

360
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:38,936
Actually, make that coffee, not tea!

361
00:29:42,786 --> 00:29:46,216
And the bathroom's a wreck.

362
00:29:46,686 --> 00:29:48,086
Clean it up.

363
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:52,016
And when you go shopping I need cigarettes.

364
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:55,026
What a pain in the neck!

365
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,296
Honey, honey...

366
00:30:03,736 --> 00:30:05,496
Where's your mother?

367
00:30:05,676 --> 00:30:07,336
Out playing Pachinko.

368
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,496
It's just about to start.

369
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:46,546
It's not over.

370
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:49,136
But I was looking forward to it.

371
00:30:49,446 --> 00:30:50,346
No.

372
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:51,976
It's a movie!

373
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:27,146
Now nobody can watch.

374
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:29,416
This is much more fun.

375
00:31:45,376 --> 00:31:46,966
I win!

376
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:45,456
Hey, Noboru.

377
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:47,766
Wanna play catch?

378
00:32:48,906 --> 00:32:49,766
Yeah.

379
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:51,266
Male Bonding

380
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:52,866
No Trespassing

381
00:32:57,606 --> 00:33:01,346
Wait, the dad's supposed to be the catcher.

382
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,236
Give me a break.

383
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:10,116
OK, this signal for a curve ball, this for a fastball,

384
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:12,116
and this for a slider.

385
00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:14,226
Give me a break.

386
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:17,356
Two outs, bases loaded, you're the relief pitcher.

387
00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:20,226
I'm the starting pitcher type.

388
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:21,956
Give me a break!

389
00:33:22,136 --> 00:33:23,766
Are you nuts?

390
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:26,366
The team never even lets you pitch.

391
00:33:26,476 --> 00:33:29,336
That's why I want to start now.

392
00:33:30,446 --> 00:33:33,746
I see. OK, let's see this starting pitcher pitch.

393
00:33:34,786 --> 00:33:37,546
It's still two outs, bases loaded.

394
00:33:37,646 --> 00:33:38,746
What!

395
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:56,796
OK, pitch.

396
00:34:02,146 --> 00:34:03,546
God damn it!

397
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,406
What are you listening to?

398
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,486
Listening over and over will improve my English.

399
00:34:19,096 --> 00:34:20,856
It's not that easy.

400
00:34:20,996 --> 00:34:22,686
In my experience...

401
00:34:22,796 --> 00:34:23,816
Study!

402
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:25,696
Study!

403
00:34:25,796 --> 00:34:29,256
Study!

404
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:52,026
It just doesn't work for me.

405
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:53,356
I'm not you.

406
00:34:59,436 --> 00:35:01,366
How'bout a drop of sake?

407
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,126
Sure.

408
00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:03,756
But, dear.

409
00:35:12,116 --> 00:35:13,636
Pretty awful, huh?

410
00:35:16,216 --> 00:35:17,546
A little dry.

411
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:19,776
What did you say!

412
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:20,786
Have you been...

413
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,186
Noboru!

414
00:35:26,296 --> 00:35:27,756
Noboru!

415
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:39,636
Hey, Noboru, let's play catch.

416
00:35:41,346 --> 00:35:42,436
Why?

417
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:47,846
Why...? It's a form of parent-child bonding.

418
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:51,246
Then it doesn't have to be catch.

419
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:53,776
I get your point, but...

420
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:58,356
It's a matter of setting the right stage.

421
00:35:59,196 --> 00:36:01,216
Forget it. Can't be bothered.

422
00:36:16,076 --> 00:36:19,066
Kids these days...

423
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:28,016
A serious generation gap...

424
00:36:32,026 --> 00:36:33,996
Paternal Supremacy Restored

425
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:39,526
Don't mix your rice into the soup.

426
00:36:39,636 --> 00:36:41,186
Listen to your father.

427
00:36:42,106 --> 00:36:44,126
Pour the soup over the rice.

428
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:48,776
Excuse me, father...

429
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:51,506
What? Got a problem with that?

430
00:36:52,246 --> 00:36:53,876
Oh, suit yourself.

431
00:36:59,656 --> 00:37:02,626
See, the water after the cement.

432
00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:05,046
Um...

433
00:37:06,626 --> 00:37:07,856
Hmmm...

434
00:37:07,966 --> 00:37:10,226
Control those chopsticks. It's rude.

435
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:14,156
Use your chopsticks with purpose.

436
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,656
That's my plate.

437
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,166
Excuse me.

438
00:37:20,036 --> 00:37:22,436
You bit it, it's yours.

439
00:37:28,116 --> 00:37:31,086
Help me think of an independent study topic.

440
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,646
Think for yourself.

441
00:37:33,016 --> 00:37:35,506
It's independent, free choice.

442
00:37:35,856 --> 00:37:39,256
I know, but I'm coming up blank.

443
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:42,526
You're free to do anything?

444
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:44,066
Right, free.

445
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:45,356
But...

446
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:51,236
Total freedom makes it tough, doesn't it?

447
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:53,096
Exactly.

448
00:37:54,946 --> 00:37:56,436
Freedom, huh...

449
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:09,886
Absolute freedom of choice...

450
00:38:15,496 --> 00:38:19,866
Glorious freedom... I dream of freedom...

451
00:38:20,236 --> 00:38:23,426
But when it comes on a silver platter...

452
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:30,576
I haven't got a clue what to do...

453
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:38,176
Now he's a philosopher.

454
00:38:38,486 --> 00:38:41,686
He's probably worrying about his own retirement.

455
00:38:42,726 --> 00:38:44,716
Father as Role Model

456
00:38:57,466 --> 00:38:59,026
The first snow!

457
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:13,656
Let's take a picture in it!

458
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:15,976
Why?

459
00:39:16,086 --> 00:39:17,886
You're hardly children anymore.

460
00:39:17,986 --> 00:39:19,986
Shut the door. It's cold.

461
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:48,486
Where's the camera?

462
00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:51,926
In the top drawer.

463
00:39:58,366 --> 00:39:59,336
Is not!

464
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:06,196
You should know where it is.

465
00:40:08,346 --> 00:40:10,336
This is the best part...

466
00:41:11,776 --> 00:41:14,836
A lone figure Back turned

467
00:41:21,016 --> 00:41:22,986
Yamada Family Chronicles

468
00:41:26,586 --> 00:41:28,846
Happy New Year

469
00:41:29,326 --> 00:41:30,916
New Year's Cards

470
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,316
Ready!

471
00:41:36,426 --> 00:41:37,256
Go!

472
00:41:37,366 --> 00:41:38,096
Mine, mine,

473
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:39,256
Mother's, Matsuko's, Nonoko's...

474
00:41:56,186 --> 00:41:58,546
31 seconds! A new record.

475
00:42:00,156 --> 00:42:01,376
Not bad.

476
00:42:05,496 --> 00:42:07,256
The Thick of Winter

477
00:42:13,296 --> 00:42:14,566
Time to get up.

478
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,156
Dad, can you get me some cake?

479
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:17,236
Coke for me.

480
00:42:17,336 --> 00:42:18,196
The tangerines, too.

481
00:42:18,306 --> 00:42:20,636
And the stove needs kerosene.

482
00:42:23,346 --> 00:42:25,746
Thank you!

483
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:38,816
Spring Showers

484
00:42:40,156 --> 00:42:42,146
Can you bring my umbrella?

485
00:42:42,266 --> 00:42:45,556
Your father needs his umbrella at the station.

486
00:42:45,836 --> 00:42:48,826
Why me? I'm studying.

487
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:52,396
You should go. Walk in the rain with your man.

488
00:42:52,506 --> 00:42:54,976
I just don't have the energy today.

489
00:42:55,076 --> 00:42:55,976
But...

490
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:59,376
Noboru! You go, please.

491
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:00,806
Make Nonoko go.

492
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:03,216
Forget it! I'll buy one.

493
00:43:03,316 --> 00:43:05,516
Pick up some pork, too?

494
00:43:05,856 --> 00:43:06,746
No Way!

495
00:44:37,106 --> 00:44:40,306
Strange... Where's Noboru's sock...

496
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:43,676
Nonoko's pajamas and Dad's towel?

497
00:44:44,316 --> 00:44:45,946
Pajamas? Socks?

498
00:44:46,056 --> 00:44:47,646
And his towel.

499
00:44:51,426 --> 00:44:52,946
Hey, wait...

500
00:44:54,756 --> 00:44:56,556
This means...

501
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,196
I knew it!

502
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:07,236
The Black Hole!

503
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:09,796
The Perfect Combo

504
00:45:11,046 --> 00:45:14,206
Maybe we'll order sushi in for dinner...

505
00:45:15,586 --> 00:45:20,176
Oh, what a waste of money! I'll make the sushi.

506
00:45:20,556 --> 00:45:22,386
Just as I hoped...

507
00:45:26,996 --> 00:45:29,116
Say, mother...

508
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:33,126
Sushi's not interesting. I thought I'd go gourmet.

509
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:37,896
I see...So what is it?

510
00:45:38,006 --> 00:45:40,836
Beef Stroganoga...

511
00:45:40,936 --> 00:45:43,106
Don't cook what you can't spell.

512
00:45:43,206 --> 00:45:44,606
Well, excuse me!

513
00:45:46,316 --> 00:45:49,546
It's Beef Stroganoff, right?

514
00:45:49,816 --> 00:45:51,576
You knew all along.

515
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:53,586
I know very well.

516
00:45:53,956 --> 00:45:58,516
Beef Stroganoga is just the Strogaffgaff of beef.

517
00:45:58,626 --> 00:46:01,096
Whatever, just make it.

518
00:46:02,396 --> 00:46:05,696
Darn. I was really counting on sushi.

519
00:46:20,716 --> 00:46:24,476
No good. I screwed it up. Order the sushi.

520
00:46:25,046 --> 00:46:27,046
Breakfast of Champions

521
00:46:30,686 --> 00:46:33,556
Wow, miso soup, fried egg and seaweed.

522
00:46:34,696 --> 00:46:37,026
A real Japanese breakfast.

523
00:46:37,126 --> 00:46:39,186
Well, actually...

524
00:46:41,836 --> 00:46:43,306
Nonoko's leftovers?

525
00:46:45,406 --> 00:46:46,426
Yesterday's soup?

526
00:46:48,006 --> 00:46:49,376
Extra seaweed from lunch?

527
00:46:50,576 --> 00:46:52,236
Precisely!

528
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:55,706
Today's your lucky day.

529
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:57,116
Hardly!

530
00:46:59,786 --> 00:47:01,256
Take care.

531
00:47:03,686 --> 00:47:05,016
Matsuko...

532
00:47:14,196 --> 00:47:16,896
When's lunch, Matsuko?

533
00:47:18,806 --> 00:47:23,436
What are you talking about? We just ate.

534
00:47:23,906 --> 00:47:26,176
You're too young to be senile.

535
00:47:26,616 --> 00:47:27,906
You sure...?

536
00:47:28,016 --> 00:47:31,976
The noodles, a few... Oops!

537
00:47:35,256 --> 00:47:37,386
I ate them all myself...

538
00:47:37,486 --> 00:47:38,456
Hey!

539
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:47,566
What's for dinner?

540
00:47:47,996 --> 00:47:49,226
Shabu shabu.

541
00:47:51,466 --> 00:47:53,806
We have it all the time.

542
00:47:53,906 --> 00:47:56,466
Shabu shabu's perfect for winter.

543
00:48:00,346 --> 00:48:02,436
OK, help yourselves.

544
00:48:03,246 --> 00:48:05,946
This way, she doesn't have to cook.

545
00:48:06,786 --> 00:48:06,816
Cold noodles for lunch again?

546
00:48:06,816 --> 00:48:09,306
Cold noodles for lunch again?

547
00:48:09,426 --> 00:48:11,186
That's what we had yesterday!

548
00:48:11,286 --> 00:48:13,586
And the day before.

549
00:48:13,696 --> 00:48:15,286
That doesn't make sense!

550
00:48:16,626 --> 00:48:18,896
And again tomorrow!?

551
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:22,526
Noodles! What else?

552
00:48:23,436 --> 00:48:26,366
Lots of free ginger in the garden to go with it.

553
00:48:27,806 --> 00:48:29,796
Ginger Morning

554
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:35,146
The ginger's good in miso soup.

555
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:40,016
Yes, though they do say it makes you forgetful.

556
00:48:40,786 --> 00:48:43,316
Oh dear. He left his bag.

557
00:48:44,156 --> 00:48:47,316
He's bound to notice. He can't be that dumb.

558
00:48:47,896 --> 00:48:48,726
Right.

559
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:50,386
Oh, no, I forgot...

560
00:49:00,206 --> 00:49:02,266
...to take of my pajamas!

561
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:07,806
I'm off.

562
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:08,976
OK.

563
00:49:11,386 --> 00:49:12,846
Have a nice day.

564
00:49:17,556 --> 00:49:18,816
I'm off.

565
00:49:21,996 --> 00:49:23,226
My shoes!

566
00:49:27,636 --> 00:49:28,996
Mom, look!

567
00:49:30,366 --> 00:49:31,396
Dad!

568
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:33,436
What's all the fuss!

569
00:49:34,176 --> 00:49:34,866
My train!

570
00:49:34,976 --> 00:49:36,206
I'll be late!

571
00:49:36,946 --> 00:49:38,636
Be careful.

572
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,976
I'm off to school.

573
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:46,386
Off you go...

574
00:49:47,486 --> 00:49:51,446
Can't even close the door behind them.

575
00:50:00,996 --> 00:50:02,336
What's this?

576
00:50:02,436 --> 00:50:05,196
Oh, Nonoko forgot her lunch.

577
00:50:05,306 --> 00:50:06,826
She needs it by noon?

578
00:50:06,936 --> 00:50:08,666
Sure, but...

579
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,566
Fine, I'll take it to her when I go shopping.

580
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,166
That'll really be a help.

581
00:50:20,056 --> 00:50:21,386
I'm off.

582
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:23,926
OK. Thank you.

583
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,686
What's this?

584
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:37,156
Oh, no, she's forgotten her purse and everything.

585
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:42,206
She'll be back.

586
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:49,076
Watch the house, OK?

587
00:50:53,816 --> 00:50:56,716
Oh no! I left the kettle on.

588
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:04,396
Mrs. Yamada, delivery!

589
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,926
Are they out?

590
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:12,696
No, they're in.

591
00:51:13,576 --> 00:51:15,126
Oh, Mrs. Yamada.

592
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,406
Oh, I did turn it off.

593
00:51:23,086 --> 00:51:25,146
Were you robbed?

594
00:51:36,266 --> 00:51:37,786
Here's your package.

595
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:41,166
Oh, thank you.

596
00:51:41,996 --> 00:51:42,826
Your seal...?

597
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:44,406
Oh, sorry.

598
00:51:44,806 --> 00:51:48,706
Let's see... Where do I keep it?

599
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:52,366
It's in the back of the second drawer.

600
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,306
Oh, goodness...

601
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,776
Always a pleasure.

602
00:51:57,886 --> 00:51:59,116
Thank you.

603
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,286
I delivered Nonoko's lunch.

604
00:52:05,496 --> 00:52:09,796
Why mother, I thought you were going shopping.

605
00:52:10,066 --> 00:52:12,796
Oops, I forgot.

606
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:18,436
Too much ginger...!

607
00:52:19,976 --> 00:52:22,946
Regret

608
00:52:37,286 --> 00:52:38,256
Say...

609
00:52:42,196 --> 00:52:44,026
Is it Mahler...

610
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:50,826
I didn't know she was a classical music fan...

611
00:53:09,756 --> 00:53:13,246
Art is Brief Life is Long

612
00:53:18,626 --> 00:53:20,756
They're in full bloom.

613
00:53:25,336 --> 00:53:29,536
I wonder how many more times I'll see the cherry blossoms.

614
00:53:30,446 --> 00:53:35,146
Don't be silly, mother. You're only 70.

615
00:53:36,016 --> 00:53:38,646
Maybe 30 more...

616
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:53,693
Mom, will you go pay the taxes?

617
00:53:53,793 --> 00:53:55,023
Leave it to me.

618
00:53:57,403 --> 00:53:59,563
You hand it to the clerk, got that?

619
00:53:59,673 --> 00:54:02,763
I know. Don't treat me like a child.

620
00:54:07,573 --> 00:54:11,603
Oh, dear, what a terrible calamity...

621
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:14,983
I'm really going senile.

622
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:17,453
Nice to see you.

623
00:54:17,553 --> 00:54:19,853
Take care, bye.

624
00:54:24,223 --> 00:54:26,523
I put it in the mail box!

625
00:54:33,133 --> 00:54:37,693
Why, Shige... Thanks for coming to visit.

626
00:54:37,973 --> 00:54:41,413
Well, I heard you were suddenly hospitalized.

627
00:54:41,613 --> 00:54:44,673
You'll never believe it...

628
00:54:45,043 --> 00:54:46,843
Have a seat.

629
00:54:55,123 --> 00:54:56,153
You see...

630
00:54:56,263 --> 00:54:57,283
Yes.

631
00:54:58,863 --> 00:54:59,923
Look.

632
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:04,063
See the guy visiting that patient over there?

633
00:55:04,503 --> 00:55:07,963
I'm sure they're having an affair.

634
00:55:08,073 --> 00:55:09,433
What!

635
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:14,073
Are you...?

636
00:55:14,343 --> 00:55:19,143
They definitely look suspicious to me!

637
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,713
Suspicious, right?

638
00:55:29,523 --> 00:55:31,253
This is a special room.

639
00:55:31,363 --> 00:55:35,853
That notorious city councilman
accused of corruption is in there now.

640
00:55:40,033 --> 00:55:43,993
I occasionally come up here for a breath of fresh air.

641
00:55:51,043 --> 00:55:54,143
These noodles are pretty good, right?

642
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:56,283
They are.

643
00:56:00,793 --> 00:56:05,693
But the coffee's really lousy here.

644
00:56:07,393 --> 00:56:11,633
By the way, why are you in the hospital?

645
00:56:18,643 --> 00:56:20,203
Oh, Shige...!

646
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:31,653
No sign of death's approach
In the ciccada's voices - Basho

647
00:56:37,463 --> 00:56:39,293
Why, mother.

648
00:56:41,933 --> 00:56:43,293
Turn on the light.

649
00:56:44,203 --> 00:56:47,963
Oh, I hadn't noticed it getting dark.

650
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:02,773
Noboru! Turn off your light.

651
00:57:02,883 --> 00:57:04,213
I'm not asleep!

652
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,393
Age Comes More Easily Than Wisdom

653
00:57:10,423 --> 00:57:14,193
Five problems left. I'm so sleepy.

654
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,423
A hot bath will wake you up.

655
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:36,623
In you go.

656
00:57:44,263 --> 00:57:45,193
Feel better?

657
00:57:45,363 --> 00:57:47,353
Yup! I'm wide awake.

658
00:57:50,203 --> 00:57:53,863
OK, here goes!

659
00:57:54,533 --> 00:57:57,763
Here goes, here goes...

660
00:57:58,743 --> 00:58:00,363
Here...goes...

661
00:58:10,283 --> 00:58:14,223
You're as limp as a noodle.

662
00:58:15,653 --> 00:58:17,923
Don't give up.

663
00:58:18,093 --> 00:58:22,963
In a fire, the first 5 minutes count.
In a test, it's the last 5 minutes.

664
00:58:30,343 --> 00:58:34,203
Time's up. Turn in your papers.

665
00:58:38,313 --> 00:58:39,503
Ma'm!

666
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:43,383
Tanaka felt sick and had to go to the nurse's office!

667
00:58:43,823 --> 00:58:44,913
Yes...

668
00:58:45,123 --> 00:58:47,283
We deserve make-up time!

669
00:58:48,293 --> 00:58:49,413
Forget it.

670
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:57,433
Put them in the upstairs closet?

671
00:58:57,533 --> 00:58:58,393
Sure.

672
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:29,393
Noboru's studying like a demon.

673
00:59:30,303 --> 00:59:33,663
But the exams are over.

674
00:59:33,773 --> 00:59:35,533
He did miserably.

675
00:59:47,313 --> 00:59:50,183
About Noboru's tutor.

676
00:59:50,683 --> 00:59:52,173
He really needs one?

677
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:54,553
He's my son, after all.

678
00:59:54,653 --> 00:59:56,053
You've got a point.

679
00:59:59,193 --> 01:00:02,993
But isn't it expensive?

680
01:00:03,403 --> 01:00:07,203
$300 for 2 sessions with a university student.

681
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:08,773
What!

682
01:00:09,603 --> 01:00:11,873
For $300, I'll teach him.

683
01:00:11,973 --> 01:00:14,673
I'll teach him for $200.

684
01:00:16,143 --> 01:00:18,583
Pay me $100 and I'll work harder!

685
01:00:21,753 --> 01:00:25,053
This is getting us nowhere...

686
01:00:30,723 --> 01:00:38,133
Fleeting dreams An octopus making its home
in a trap A summer moon - Basho

687
01:00:45,443 --> 01:00:46,563
I'm home!

688
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,243
Look, chocolates!

689
01:00:57,423 --> 01:01:02,623
Mommy! Noboru bought chocolates!

690
01:01:02,863 --> 01:01:05,483
They were a Valentine's Day present!

691
01:01:06,733 --> 01:01:08,723
Adolescence

692
01:01:09,363 --> 01:01:10,233
Gone!

693
01:01:10,803 --> 01:01:12,393
Gone, gone, gone!

694
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:13,733
I'm home!

695
01:01:14,933 --> 01:01:17,403
Where are those cookies, Nonoko!

696
01:01:17,543 --> 01:01:18,593
I ate them.

697
01:01:18,803 --> 01:01:22,143
What! I got them for a girl!

698
01:01:22,243 --> 01:01:23,443
But...

699
01:01:23,543 --> 01:01:25,073
No ifs ands or buts!

700
01:01:25,383 --> 01:01:28,243
Mommy already ate half.

701
01:01:28,353 --> 01:01:29,843
Mother...?

702
01:01:40,433 --> 01:01:43,363
Damn...I forgot my umbrella.

703
01:01:43,663 --> 01:01:45,033
Hey, Yamada!

704
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:47,493
Use my umbrella.

705
01:01:47,873 --> 01:01:49,033
How'bout you?

706
01:01:49,133 --> 01:01:50,363
I'll be fine.

707
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:55,373
Say, Tanaka, I forgot my umbrella!

708
01:01:56,183 --> 01:01:58,643
Too bad. Don't catch cold.

709
01:02:07,453 --> 01:02:08,923
Rejected.

710
01:02:10,663 --> 01:02:11,553
No!

711
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:14,583
Give it back!

712
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:15,753
Not after that.

713
01:02:15,863 --> 01:02:16,993
But it's mine.

714
01:02:17,103 --> 01:02:18,093
Thanks for the favor.

715
01:02:18,203 --> 01:02:19,323
Give it back!

716
01:02:19,933 --> 01:02:21,633
Guess it's a rain date.

717
01:02:26,443 --> 01:02:28,003
Hey, Nakamura.

718
01:02:28,213 --> 01:02:30,043
Back to sock the teacher?

719
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:34,043
Don't be stupid. I came to tell him I got into college.

720
01:02:34,613 --> 01:02:36,483
Wow, you made it!

721
01:02:42,493 --> 01:02:43,513
Sir...?

722
01:02:43,623 --> 01:02:44,823
No need to run...

723
01:02:45,193 --> 01:02:46,323
from Nakamura.

724
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:49,193
Idiot! Don't believe the rumors.

725
01:02:51,133 --> 01:02:52,933
Hey, Yamada, Yamashita,

726
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,433
let's buy some dirty books.

727
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:09,413
Hey!

728
01:03:10,323 --> 01:03:11,153
Shoot!

729
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:14,483
What a coincidence.

730
01:03:18,523 --> 01:03:22,593
Tragedy in Bosnia...! You've got serious taste.

731
01:03:22,693 --> 01:03:25,933
Well, Japan's part of a bigger world.

732
01:03:27,903 --> 01:03:29,833
Can I borrow it later?

733
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:34,373
A real tragedy...

734
01:03:37,683 --> 01:03:38,843
I'm home.

735
01:03:41,413 --> 01:03:42,383
Noboru,

736
01:03:43,883 --> 01:03:45,253
the textbook?

737
01:03:45,353 --> 01:03:46,253
This?

738
01:03:46,693 --> 01:03:48,813
I gave you $10 for it.

739
01:03:49,093 --> 01:03:50,453
I want to see it.

740
01:04:08,273 --> 01:04:09,803
'F-1 Racing for Students'

741
01:04:09,913 --> 01:04:11,503
What is this!

742
01:04:12,713 --> 01:04:15,443
'Formula-1 Racing for Students'?

743
01:04:15,553 --> 01:04:18,883
It'll help my English and my geography.

744
01:04:20,753 --> 01:04:21,683
You idiot!

745
01:04:22,423 --> 01:04:24,183
You're the one who gave me

746
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:27,923
'The Power Ranger's ABC' when I was 3!

747
01:04:28,733 --> 01:04:31,993
Noboru, there's a girl on the phone.

748
01:04:32,103 --> 01:04:33,333
What!

749
01:04:40,013 --> 01:04:41,103
Oh, hello...

750
01:04:42,143 --> 01:04:43,573
Oh, yeah, it's me...

751
01:04:54,823 --> 01:04:56,483
Go away!

752
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:02,153
Oh, no, nothing.

753
01:05:03,903 --> 01:05:07,563
Yeah, yeah, OK.

754
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:12,993
A girlfriend...with his looks?

755
01:05:13,113 --> 01:05:14,303
A real girlfriend?

756
01:05:14,413 --> 01:05:15,743
His face is red.

757
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:17,943
Yeah, OK.

758
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:20,143
Bye, then.

759
01:05:32,293 --> 01:05:34,123
It's pounding away!

760
01:05:34,233 --> 01:05:35,423
An irregular heartbeat?

761
01:05:35,533 --> 01:05:36,763
Let's see.

762
01:05:47,973 --> 01:05:49,463
Do you think he's upset?

763
01:05:49,573 --> 01:05:52,373
You insulted him, mother.

764
01:05:52,483 --> 01:05:55,813
This, from the paragon of motherhood?

765
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:50,363
The scent of plums On a mountain path
Suddenly dawn - Basho

766
01:06:50,703 --> 01:06:52,673
Yamada Family Chronicles

767
01:06:55,113 --> 01:06:56,543
I'm home...

768
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:58,303
Welcome back.

769
01:07:00,753 --> 01:07:02,583
An Autumn Night

770
01:07:09,293 --> 01:07:10,523
I'm hungry.

771
01:07:12,693 --> 01:07:13,893
Anything to eat?

772
01:07:14,493 --> 01:07:15,653
Coming right up.

773
01:07:23,403 --> 01:07:25,463
Red bean cake or banana.

774
01:07:28,773 --> 01:07:33,343
Who the hell would want to come home to bean cakes

775
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,183
after working hard all day!

776
01:07:37,783 --> 01:07:39,343
OK, a banana.

777
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:43,693
What a jerk! Who wants a banana!

778
01:09:33,373 --> 01:09:40,073
Turn towards me I'm lonely too The autumn dusk - Basho

779
01:09:42,213 --> 01:09:45,943
Mom's down with a cold. We'll get take-out tonight.

780
01:09:46,043 --> 01:09:46,703
Seaweed-rice special.

781
01:09:46,813 --> 01:09:47,903
Me too!

782
01:09:48,013 --> 01:09:49,243
I'll have the salmon-rice.

783
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:51,573
How'bout you, mother?

784
01:09:51,953 --> 01:09:53,473
The combination special.

785
01:09:55,423 --> 01:09:56,653
I'll go get it!

786
01:09:56,763 --> 01:09:58,423
Not so fast!

787
01:10:02,263 --> 01:10:04,663
Tempura-rice for me!

788
01:10:04,763 --> 01:10:06,663
Going My Way

789
01:10:06,803 --> 01:10:09,773
Croquet Tournament

790
01:10:10,273 --> 01:10:11,703
That's good.

791
01:10:13,973 --> 01:10:15,963
Hey, hey, lady...

792
01:10:17,643 --> 01:10:19,273
You can't do that!

793
01:10:19,813 --> 01:10:22,283
What? But this is...

794
01:10:23,153 --> 01:10:27,183
It's empty now, but someone may put a poster up.
There's an election.

795
01:10:27,293 --> 01:10:29,413
But, mister...

796
01:10:32,063 --> 01:10:34,393
This was the only thing underneath.

797
01:10:42,203 --> 01:10:44,903
If it isn't old Saburo...

798
01:10:46,943 --> 01:10:49,373
This is my territory.

799
01:10:49,613 --> 01:10:52,273
Oh, it's you, Shige.

800
01:10:52,543 --> 01:10:55,643
We might as well work together, we're volunteers.

801
01:11:01,053 --> 01:11:03,923
You're on that side, I'm on this.

802
01:11:05,393 --> 01:11:06,983
Don't cross over.

803
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:11,563
Oh, boy, she hasn't changed a bit in 60 years.

804
01:11:14,073 --> 01:11:17,433
Oh, no, I forgot to take out the garbage...

805
01:11:20,513 --> 01:11:22,563
Oh, well, I'll have to sort it!

806
01:11:22,673 --> 01:11:26,203
Why sort burnables?

807
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:29,243
Trash can at the station,

808
01:11:29,353 --> 01:11:32,373
Nonoko does the park, Noboru does the store.

809
01:11:33,183 --> 01:11:34,343
You can't do that!

810
01:11:34,453 --> 01:11:36,943
Why not? It's a great plan.

811
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:37,953
Off we go.

812
01:11:38,063 --> 01:11:39,583
See you later.

813
01:11:41,693 --> 01:11:42,493
Ouch!

814
01:11:42,733 --> 01:11:47,133
Here I volunteer cleaning up the park
and you dump trash there!

815
01:11:47,233 --> 01:11:50,463
I'm not dumping, just using the public trash cans.

816
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:52,403
That's the problem!

817
01:11:52,503 --> 01:11:54,503
Mom...

818
01:12:09,253 --> 01:12:11,253
The Fight for Justice

819
01:12:11,793 --> 01:12:13,023
Excuse us!

820
01:12:16,063 --> 01:12:17,863
Our ball fell in...

821
01:12:22,203 --> 01:12:27,003
This new one or this rubber ball?

822
01:12:29,043 --> 01:12:30,533
The rubber ball!

823
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:44,323
Honesty's the best policy. Don't ever lie.

824
01:12:45,093 --> 01:12:46,063
OK.

825
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:48,393
Take this one too.

826
01:12:49,563 --> 01:12:50,863
Wow! Thanks!

827
01:12:58,743 --> 01:13:02,003
Excuse me... Our ball fell in yesterday...

828
01:13:02,113 --> 01:13:03,473
But you weren't here.

829
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:06,043
Didn't see any.

830
01:13:07,053 --> 01:13:08,343
I see...

831
01:13:09,653 --> 01:13:12,483
I'm sure this was the house.

832
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:22,753
I beg you, please tell those boys
to give him his new ball back.

833
01:13:29,373 --> 01:13:31,533
Oh, poor things.

834
01:13:31,643 --> 01:13:35,473
You're right, they're all wilted.

835
01:13:36,073 --> 01:13:38,913
Not the flowers! The accident!

836
01:13:39,143 --> 01:13:40,543
Oh, I see.

837
01:13:41,213 --> 01:13:43,273
It was a motor cycle gang.

838
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:47,483
The poor guard rail.

839
01:13:47,593 --> 01:13:48,643
Mother!

840
01:13:48,753 --> 01:13:52,883
It was the poor child's parents who suffered...

841
01:14:26,763 --> 01:14:29,733
They're so loud, has to be a motorcycle gang.

842
01:14:30,093 --> 01:14:31,653
They're by the park.

843
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:34,963
They're the litterbugs!

844
01:14:35,073 --> 01:14:36,433
I'll go scold them.

845
01:14:36,533 --> 01:14:38,333
That's dangerous, mother!

846
01:14:38,443 --> 01:14:41,133
Someone was recently murdered for that.

847
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:43,233
Senior Citizen Murdered

848
01:14:43,683 --> 01:14:45,733
Hmm, I know.

849
01:14:54,493 --> 01:14:56,223
That's worse!

850
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:07,563
Mm...mother! Why the get up?

851
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:10,603
Says she's scolding the motorcycle gang.

852
01:15:10,703 --> 01:15:12,933
Won't you stop her, please.

853
01:15:13,513 --> 01:15:19,443
You can't wear that hard-hat.
It's a momento from when we built the house.

854
01:15:19,913 --> 01:15:22,943
Oh. Well that's too bad.

855
01:15:23,153 --> 01:15:26,083
I'm sorry, but you can't.

856
01:15:26,483 --> 01:15:27,643
In that case,

857
01:15:27,753 --> 01:15:30,153
you wear it and go.

858
01:15:30,323 --> 01:15:31,813
I go!?

859
01:15:32,623 --> 01:15:37,323
They're not vicious. They'll go home eventually.

860
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:40,293
Then you have nothing to fear.

861
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:43,963
Give them a manly scolding. You're older.

862
01:15:44,503 --> 01:15:45,493
Manly...?

863
01:15:45,603 --> 01:15:47,373
But mother...

864
01:15:47,473 --> 01:15:49,843
I know, let's report them to 911.

865
01:15:49,943 --> 01:15:54,343
The poor kids. They don't deserve
a criminal record for making noise.

866
01:15:54,653 --> 01:15:55,873
A record!

867
01:16:12,733 --> 01:16:14,323
See, they're gone.

868
01:16:15,403 --> 01:16:16,773
You think?

869
01:16:27,013 --> 01:16:28,273
What did I tell you?

870
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,253
We're relying on you.

871
01:16:36,993 --> 01:16:39,223
All right, I'll just go look.

872
01:16:41,693 --> 01:16:44,093
Be careful, dear!

873
01:17:32,183 --> 01:17:34,273
Um, excuse me...

874
01:17:34,713 --> 01:17:36,113
What do you want?

875
01:17:36,213 --> 01:17:38,983
It's awfully late.

876
01:17:39,323 --> 01:17:40,653
Yeah? So what?

877
01:17:43,923 --> 01:17:45,553
Got a problem?

878
01:17:45,663 --> 01:17:49,423
N, no, we can work this out. I don't have a problem...

879
01:17:49,763 --> 01:17:54,823
I don't have a problem, but I do have a request.

880
01:17:55,073 --> 01:17:56,063
Spit it out.

881
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:59,673
Ask away, old man.

882
01:18:00,573 --> 01:18:03,303
Would you mind turning off your headlight.

883
01:18:03,543 --> 01:18:06,313
So that's your request, then?

884
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:08,283
Um, n, no.

885
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,373
Whaddya want then?

886
01:18:15,353 --> 01:18:20,853
Come, come fireflies,
this water's bitter, this water's sweet

887
01:18:20,963 --> 01:18:22,193
What is that!

888
01:18:33,973 --> 01:18:35,403
That old bag's nuts.

889
01:18:36,013 --> 01:18:37,703
Mother, are you all right!?

890
01:18:41,453 --> 01:18:43,043
An old bag, huh?

891
01:18:43,283 --> 01:18:47,413
At least turn down that putt-putt.
You're a neighborhood nuisance.

892
01:18:47,623 --> 01:18:49,983
M, mother, you can't talk to these low-lifes.

893
01:18:50,093 --> 01:18:51,853
Who you calling low-life!

894
01:18:51,963 --> 01:18:54,453
How exciting!

895
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:57,193
What a great voice, you have.

896
01:18:57,303 --> 01:18:58,733
Mother!

897
01:18:58,903 --> 01:19:02,563
And a fine face and physique to go with it.

898
01:19:02,673 --> 01:19:05,833
I bet people shut up when you talk.

899
01:19:06,173 --> 01:19:07,233
Get to the point!

900
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:12,073
Really scary. You sure shut this guy up in a hurry.

901
01:19:12,183 --> 01:19:13,073
A cinch.

902
01:19:13,183 --> 01:19:18,513
When you yell at people,
it reminds me of a snake staring down a frog.

903
01:19:20,493 --> 01:19:26,323
It sure must be fun shutting people up
and ordering them around.

904
01:19:26,523 --> 01:19:27,253
It's OK.

905
01:19:27,363 --> 01:19:33,023
I know, why don't you employ your venom
in the cause of justice?

906
01:19:33,533 --> 01:19:34,523
What?

907
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:38,773
Don't you like fighting for justice,
that Masked Rider stuff?

908
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,013
Way old, granny.

909
01:19:42,113 --> 01:19:46,303
Of course, it's not exactly cool, is it? Nowadays,

910
01:19:46,483 --> 01:19:50,113
we turn a blind eye to every kind of misdeed.

911
01:19:50,213 --> 01:19:54,123
But I know you could do it. Because you're fearless.

912
01:19:55,923 --> 01:19:59,863
Someone tosses a cigarette butt or can from their car,

913
01:19:59,963 --> 01:20:03,653
you use that voice of yours, make'em pick it up.

914
01:20:04,763 --> 01:20:08,253
You see a kid causing trouble on the subway,

915
01:20:08,373 --> 01:20:11,203
you gently tap him on the shoulder.

916
01:20:11,803 --> 01:20:15,333
I'm sure anyone will do whatever you say.

917
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:20,433
We'll all be so happy, we'll cheer you on.

918
01:20:23,353 --> 01:20:27,343
It's nice to be appreciated.

919
01:20:27,753 --> 01:20:30,243
While you're at it, scare off thugs,

920
01:20:30,353 --> 01:20:34,263
and take the bad guys' money.

921
01:20:35,733 --> 01:20:40,563
What do you say, will you heed an old bag's plea
and fight for justice?

922
01:20:40,733 --> 01:20:45,433
It'll be a whole lot better
than listening to me rant and rave.

923
01:20:47,643 --> 01:20:50,163
I think this old lady's nuts.

924
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:52,873
No go?

925
01:20:53,113 --> 01:20:57,843
What a shame, with your godly attributes.

926
01:21:00,953 --> 01:21:01,943
Outta here!

927
01:21:09,593 --> 01:21:12,093
Think about fighting for justice!

928
01:21:17,843 --> 01:21:19,203
Hey, you forgot this.

929
01:21:31,323 --> 01:21:32,653
Did he get it?

930
01:21:32,753 --> 01:21:34,553
Mother!

931
01:21:48,273 --> 01:21:51,833
Noboru! Nonoko!

932
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,833
Mother!

933
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:50,733
It's the Masked Rider!

934
01:23:30,873 --> 01:23:32,963
The Masked Rider!

935
01:24:16,713 --> 01:24:18,883
Help...

936
01:24:28,693 --> 01:24:30,063
Mother!

937
01:24:30,693 --> 01:24:32,093
Noboru!

938
01:24:33,703 --> 01:24:35,463
Nonoko...

939
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:51,883
Thank you, Masked Rider!

940
01:25:39,933 --> 01:25:45,603
How cruel A grasshopper
trapped Under a warrior's helmet - Basho

941
01:25:53,443 --> 01:25:54,543
I'm home.

942
01:25:54,753 --> 01:25:56,983
Did you bring your umbrella home?

943
01:25:57,883 --> 01:26:01,753
Your husband's home from work, exhausted, and

944
01:26:01,853 --> 01:26:06,083
all you can ask is'did you bring your umbrella home!'

945
01:26:06,193 --> 01:26:08,953
OK, OK. Welcome home. Have a hard day?

946
01:26:09,533 --> 01:26:10,993
Where's your umbrella?

947
01:26:11,903 --> 01:26:13,263
I forgot it.

948
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:20,203
Welcome home.

949
01:26:20,303 --> 01:26:25,143
Look, I remembered to bring it home, so there, ha!

950
01:26:29,253 --> 01:26:32,223
What? Got a problem?

951
01:26:33,423 --> 01:26:37,153
But you didn't take an umbrella today.

952
01:26:39,263 --> 01:26:40,153
See?

953
01:26:41,293 --> 01:26:43,283
Section Chief Yamada

954
01:26:43,563 --> 01:26:44,893
I bought a cake.

955
01:26:45,003 --> 01:26:45,983
Really?

956
01:26:47,463 --> 01:26:49,903
Once in a blue moon...

957
01:26:50,703 --> 01:26:53,173
Guilty conscience?

958
01:26:53,273 --> 01:26:54,003
What was that!

959
01:26:54,103 --> 01:26:58,273
That's going too far.
Here Takashi's thoughtfully gone and...

960
01:26:58,383 --> 01:26:59,973
I even bought custard.

961
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:04,013
Now that's suspicious.

962
01:27:07,753 --> 01:27:13,193
Nonoko! Noboru! Your father got cake!

963
01:27:20,163 --> 01:27:21,393
Where's Dad?

964
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:23,503
On a business trip.

965
01:27:24,173 --> 01:27:25,603
But his briefcase...

966
01:27:27,003 --> 01:27:29,973
Oh no, he must've forgotten it.

967
01:27:30,113 --> 01:27:31,803
And his scarf and train pass.

968
01:27:33,483 --> 01:27:34,573
What? Oh, no!

969
01:27:35,113 --> 01:27:38,083
He was supposed to leave early.

970
01:27:38,183 --> 01:27:39,623
Father!

971
01:27:41,093 --> 01:27:42,383
Dear!

972
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:49,433
Section Chief Yamada

973
01:27:49,993 --> 01:27:51,623
Mom must've overslept.

974
01:27:52,933 --> 01:27:56,923
She woke up late and thought Dad had already left.

975
01:27:57,073 --> 01:27:58,593
Oh, I see.

976
01:28:06,283 --> 01:28:08,513
B...b...briefcase!

977
01:28:08,953 --> 01:28:10,573
H...h...here!

978
01:28:11,283 --> 01:28:12,213
I'm off!

979
01:28:12,483 --> 01:28:14,453
Have a nice trip!

980
01:28:18,423 --> 01:28:20,453
Be careful!

981
01:28:24,503 --> 01:28:25,963
I can still make it.

982
01:28:53,893 --> 01:28:55,453
Are you OK?

983
01:29:07,773 --> 01:29:08,933
Phone, phone...

984
01:29:19,923 --> 01:29:22,283
I suddenly feel terrible...

985
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:28,123
I can hardly breathe...

986
01:29:28,433 --> 01:29:31,423
Yes, yes, I'll get there.

987
01:29:32,203 --> 01:29:34,363
I'll crawl there if I have to...

988
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:36,533
Please tell the client...

989
01:29:36,733 --> 01:29:40,403
Yes, yes, I'm terribly sorry...

990
01:29:45,243 --> 01:29:46,803
A slight fever.

991
01:29:47,853 --> 01:29:49,143
You should stay home.

992
01:29:50,383 --> 01:29:52,413
Before it gets worse.

993
01:29:52,523 --> 01:29:55,313
The company won't take care o you.

994
01:29:57,393 --> 01:30:00,853
You know, maybe I will. Make a long weekend of it.

995
01:30:00,963 --> 01:30:03,153
You should, you should.

996
01:30:03,263 --> 01:30:06,793
It's good to relax and enjoy some time at home.

997
01:30:23,113 --> 01:30:24,983
...What is it?

998
01:30:27,323 --> 01:30:31,013
I started feeling better,
the minute I decided to stay home.

999
01:30:31,523 --> 01:30:34,083
I guess I'll go in after all.

1000
01:30:48,173 --> 01:30:49,833
Take care, dear.

1001
01:31:57,573 --> 01:32:01,073
Next, Mr. Yamada will offer his congratulations.

1002
01:32:01,653 --> 01:32:04,113
Your notes, dear.

1003
01:32:10,423 --> 01:32:12,583
He's wound tight as a spring!

1004
01:32:20,303 --> 01:32:25,533
Um... This is a fine, auspicious day...

1005
01:32:29,973 --> 01:32:33,473
Cucumber, garbage bags, light bulbs

1006
01:32:46,863 --> 01:32:49,293
Life is full of surprises...

1007
01:32:55,173 --> 01:32:57,863
Now...that is, up until now...

1008
01:32:58,603 --> 01:33:01,403
things seemed to be just fine...

1009
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:05,903
then suddenly, you're shoved off a cliff!

1010
01:33:06,083 --> 01:33:09,103
By...your trusted spouse,

1011
01:33:09,413 --> 01:33:12,413
of all people!

1012
01:33:13,483 --> 01:33:14,923
He means you.

1013
01:33:16,793 --> 01:33:20,123
But Ichiro and Kazuko...

1014
01:33:20,493 --> 01:33:24,823
You have to accept life as it comes.

1015
01:33:27,463 --> 01:33:30,963
Acceptance is the key to surviving

1016
01:33:31,073 --> 01:33:36,703
the worst situations,
without losing heart or breaking up.

1017
01:33:37,113 --> 01:33:38,973
Breaking up?!

1018
01:33:41,043 --> 01:33:43,073
Even the worst behavior...

1019
01:33:43,613 --> 01:33:48,573
can be accepted and forgiven if there is no malice.

1020
01:33:48,693 --> 01:33:51,713
In fact, must be forgiven so one can go on with life!

1021
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:54,213
Gutsy speech!

1022
01:33:54,663 --> 01:33:59,963
It's not necessarily bad
to resign yourself to a situation.

1023
01:34:00,163 --> 01:34:02,463
In fact, it's essential.

1024
01:34:02,803 --> 01:34:05,563
A must for a happy family.

1025
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:08,873
A must for facing life and getting on with it.

1026
01:34:10,643 --> 01:34:14,343
Though it may sound negative,

1027
01:34:14,883 --> 01:34:17,973
'acceptance'

1028
01:34:18,183 --> 01:34:22,883
is the only way out of totally unacceptable situations.

1029
01:34:25,863 --> 01:34:30,293
I didn't know he had it in him... What a man.

1030
01:34:38,303 --> 01:34:41,963
Um, well, that is, I mean.

1031
01:34:46,043 --> 01:34:49,143
So, my dear Ichiro and Kazuko,

1032
01:34:49,483 --> 01:34:52,473
congratulations on your wedding.

1033
01:34:54,023 --> 01:34:59,983
May you be a tough, harmonious couple.

1034
01:35:10,703 --> 01:35:18,673
When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my sweetheart, what lies ahead?

1035
01:35:20,013 --> 01:35:26,783
Will we have rainbows day after day?
Here's what my sweetheart said

1036
01:35:27,583 --> 01:35:34,013
Que sera sera, whatever will be, will be

1037
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:45,373
the future's not ours to see
qué será será, qué será será

1038
01:35:47,743 --> 01:35:51,203
A skinhead cut would disguise your baldness.

1039
01:35:52,583 --> 01:35:53,633
Who asked you!

1040
01:35:54,343 --> 01:35:56,643
Don't you need dentures, mother?

1041
01:35:56,753 --> 01:35:57,583
Who asked you!

1042
01:35:57,683 --> 01:35:59,913
Cut it out! Both of you!

1043
01:36:00,023 --> 01:36:03,453
You're starting to look like a sumo wrestler.

1044
01:36:03,553 --> 01:36:04,213
You tell her!

1045
01:36:04,323 --> 01:36:05,413
How dare you!

1046
01:36:07,923 --> 01:36:11,953
You're setting a terrible example!
In front of the children.

1047
01:36:12,133 --> 01:36:14,833
I can't hear the TV!

1048
01:36:18,473 --> 01:36:20,943
I know why we're so peaceful.

1049
01:36:22,313 --> 01:36:25,333
Because all three of you are nuts.

1050
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:26,343
How dare you!

1051
01:36:26,583 --> 01:36:27,943
How dare you!

1052
01:36:28,813 --> 01:36:31,513
If even one of you were normal,

1053
01:36:32,183 --> 01:36:34,123
it'd throw off the balance.

1054
01:36:52,843 --> 01:36:54,863
What's your motto?

1055
01:36:54,973 --> 01:36:56,103
Getting married?

1056
01:36:56,213 --> 01:36:57,433
Change jobs?

1057
01:36:59,083 --> 01:37:00,703
Be quiet...

1058
01:37:07,253 --> 01:37:08,483
This.

1059
01:37:10,623 --> 01:37:14,523
DON'T OVERDO IT

1060
01:38:28,203 --> 01:38:30,793
Hey, everybody's in the picture!

1061
01:38:30,903 --> 01:38:32,163
Let's see.

1062
01:38:32,273 --> 01:38:33,533
Everyone's so tiny.

1063
01:38:33,643 --> 01:38:35,103
It's a stick-on picture.

1064
01:38:38,013 --> 01:38:40,103
Time to get some dinner...

1065
01:38:40,213 --> 01:38:41,273
Let's have pork cutlets.

1066
01:38:41,383 --> 01:38:42,353
I want pizza!

1067
01:38:42,453 --> 01:38:43,243
Tempura.

1068
01:38:43,353 --> 01:38:43,903
Spaghetti!

1069
01:38:44,113 --> 01:38:45,953
Quiet! I decide!
