1
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:09,049
Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network,
Dentsu, Hakuhodo DYMP,

2
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,510
Walt Disney Japan, Mitsubishi,
Toho and KDDI present

3
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:22,730
THE WIND RISES

4
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:30,738
<i>The wind is rising!
We must try to live.</i>

5
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,633
Here it is.

6
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,848
May I borrow it?

7
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,684
- It's in English.
- I have a dictionary.

8
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,354
- Very good. Give it a go.
- Thank you.

9
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,041
- Knock it off.
- Butt out!

10
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,709
Better get going.

11
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,545
Jiro...

12
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,172
No more bullying, okay?

13
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,359
You look quite the hero.

14
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,736
I slipped and fell.

15
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,240
- Fighting is never justified.
- I know.

16
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,493
Go have your snack.

17
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,245
Thank you.

18
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,416
Big brother, you're back!

19
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,879
I was waiting for you.
Let's pick bamboo grass.

20
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,882
Big brother!

21
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,430
I want to pick bamboo grass.

22
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,604
You promised to go with me.

23
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,980
I've got homework.

24
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,196
That's not homework.

25
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,740
It's an English magazine.

26
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,745
What a stupid moustache.

27
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,789
He's a famous Italian aircraft designer.

28
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,628
His name is Caproni.
It says he's a count.

29
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,922
- Your face is scratched.
- Leave it alone.

30
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,759
I better put some iodine on it.

31
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,802
Would you be quiet?

32
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,982
Big brother, what are you doing?

33
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,817
You're not allowed up here.

34
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,486
You're not wearing glasses.

35
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,990
Focusing on the stars
should improve my eyesight.

36
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,662
- Mother will scold you.
- A shooting star!

37
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,748
There's another one.

38
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,336
They're pretty.
See? Like that.

39
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,839
There's so many of them.

40
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,045
I'm a Japanese boy.

41
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,345
I think this is my dream.

42
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,406
This is my dream, you know.

43
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,324
It's mine too.

44
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,909
Your dream?

45
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:00,581
Listen, Japanese boy.
You think we are sharing this dream?

46
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:01,915
It's strange.

47
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,420
You're Count Caproni, aren't you?
I'm very glad to meet you.

48
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:12,092
Interesting. Yes, this is a dream.
This world is a dream.

49
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,094
Welcome to my kingdom.

50
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,763
I'm honored.

51
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,766
Look at them.

52
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:28,025
They will bomb the enemy city.
Most of them won't return.

53
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,284
But the war will soon be over.

54
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,128
Climb up, Japanese boy.

55
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,843
This is my dream.
When the war is over, I will build this.

56
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,764
Magnificent, isn't she?

57
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,808
Let's fly.

58
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,564
Instead of bombs,
she'll carry passengers.

59
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,493
Of course we can't climb up here...

60
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,663
but dreams are convenient.
One can go anywhere.

61
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,882
Come, join me.
You can walk along the spar.

62
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,180
Take a look.

63
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:19,219
- She's beautiful, no?
- Yes, incredible.

64
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,477
She'll carry a hundred people
across the Atlantic.

65
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,732
Mr. Caproni?
I have a question.

66
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,236
Do you think I could
design airplanes?

67
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,742
I'll never be a pilot.
I'm too nearsighted.

68
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,412
Listen, Japanese boy.

69
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,916
I'm not a pilot.
I don't even know how to fly.

70
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,920
To fly airplanes is simple.

71
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:57,674
But I am a creator of airplanes.
An aeronautical engineer!

72
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,217
Yes!

73
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,595
Listen to me, Japanese boy.

74
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:06,099
Airplanes are not tools for war.
They are not for making money.

75
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,769
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.

76
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,064
Engineers turn dreams into reality.

77
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,565
Yes!

78
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,693
Arrivederci. We'll meet again.

79
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,961
Jiro, you should go to bed.

80
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:39,800
You startled me.
I heard you talking to someone.

81
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,303
Mother, I'm going to be
an aeronautical engineer.

82
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,306
Really? That's a wonderful dream.

83
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,060
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
That's what he told me.

84
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,604
I want to design beautiful airplanes.

85
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,969
You, there.
Come, take my seat.

86
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,178
Pardon me.

87
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,430
Please.

88
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,718
The wind feels wonderful.

89
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,637
Miss, you'll lose your hat.

90
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,889
Don't worry, Kinu.

91
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,899
Watch out!

92
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,236
Are you all right?

93
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,030
Safe!

94
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,865
Nice play.

95
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,950
Thank you.

96
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,244
"Le vent se lève."

97
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,082
"Il faut tenter de vivre."

98
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:03,235
"Le vent se lève.
Il faut tenter de vivre."

99
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,614
"The wind is rising.
We must try to live."

100
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,127
Earthquake.

101
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,389
The boiler's going to blow!

102
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,360
- What's wrong?
- Her leg.

103
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,694
Show me.

104
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,031
It hurts.

105
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,491
Kinu, be brave.

106
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,285
It's broken.
She can't walk like this.

107
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,538
Miss, the boiler.
Please save yourself.

108
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,207
That's nonsense.

109
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,877
Nothing's going to explode.

110
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,381
My suitcase.

111
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,098
Now, try to relax.

112
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,897
She can't walk.
Where do you live?

113
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,566
- In Ueno.
- I'll get you there.

114
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,248
- Fire.
- Let's go.

115
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,349
- What about your luggage?
- It's not important.

116
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,291
I'm so sorry.

117
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,792
Hang on!

118
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,346
We'd better hurry.

119
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,518
One of my shirts.
It's brand new.

120
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,186
You must be thirsty.

121
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,151
The well's almost dry.
What about you?

122
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,403
Thank you.

123
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,536
The fire hasn't reached Ueno.

124
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,247
I'm heading for the university.
What about you?

125
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,416
I'll bring someone from home.

126
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,751
I'll go with you.

127
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,712
- Look after this, Kinu.
- I will.

128
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,132
We'll be back soon.
Don't worry.

129
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,509
Watch my suitcase.

130
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,676
- Thank you.
- I'll leave her to you.

131
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,678
But what's your name?

132
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,019
That was some guy.
Don't you think, Kinu?

133
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,665
Jiro! You picked a great day
to come back.

134
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,375
How bad is it, Honjo?

135
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,044
The whole east side is burning.

136
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,465
That's everything we could carry.

137
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,008
Got a smoke?

138
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:33,518
A flying door? That's just great.
They'll never stop the fire now.

139
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,353
Tokyo's finished.

140
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,871
He really built it.
Caproni has giant dreams.

141
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,476
Stop the camera!

142
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,278
The wind's shifting.
It's coming this way.

143
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,243
Is the wind still rising,
Japanese boy?

144
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,288
Yes, it's a gale.

145
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,417
Then you must live.
"Le vent se lève."

146
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,961
"Il faut tenter de vivre."

147
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,356
Hey Jiro. Ready?

148
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,112
All the new buildings
are old-fashioned.

149
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,364
The streets are wider.

150
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,742
Even the airplanes haven't changed.

151
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,370
Welcome!

152
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,918
Mackerel again?

153
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,545
It's great.

154
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,548
Every day's the same.
Same lunch, same lectures.

155
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,717
Can I get an egg?

156
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,053
The Western powers
are building all-metal aircraft.

157
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,681
Try the pork sometime.

158
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,684
We're more than ten years behind.

159
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,061
What?

160
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,605
Beautiful, isn't it?

161
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,566
Look at that wonderful curve.

162
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,611
You eat mackerel
to look at the bones?

163
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,239
Come on, finish up.
We're going for coffee.

164
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,420
Jiro sure is working hard.

165
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,255
Fish bones.

166
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,966
Is Mr. Horikoshi back from lunch?

167
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,134
Jiro!

168
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,553
Honjo, listen to this.

169
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,933
The NACA has a standard
curve just like this bone.

170
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,768
Do Americans eat mackerel too?

171
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,062
Jiro, package for you.

172
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:50,900
A lady brought this for you, sir.

173
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,319
You were out,
so she left it with me.

174
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,947
I see. Thank you.

175
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,117
Present from your sweetheart?

176
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,120
Got a smoke? Gimme one.

177
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,556
- Jiro!
- Let him go.

178
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,374
- Hello, Mr. Horikoshi.
- Back from school.

179
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:52,670
Your guest is waiting.
A young lady.

180
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,505
Oh, right.

181
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,558
Honestly, where were you?

182
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,060
Kayo, I'm sorry.

183
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,313
I completely forgot.

184
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,689
Really!

185
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,400
- Where's Mother?
- At Uncle's.

186
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,069
- Is she staying there?
- Just for one night.

187
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:21,824
You've grown, Kayo.
And gotten very pretty, too.

188
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:26,329
You're so mean.
You never ever come home.

189
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,668
Oh, it's almost sunset already.

190
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:37,214
I'll tell them I kept you.
Let's take the penny steamer.

191
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,928
She must really like you.

192
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,722
Come on, it's been two years.

193
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,558
Didn't you try to see her again?

194
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,269
Of course.
I went back once.

195
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,076
The fire stopped at her street.

196
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,661
See? There's the dock.

197
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,092
Are you cold?

198
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:25,304
I'm fine. I never dreamed
Tokyo would recover so quickly.

199
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,269
Can I stay with you, Jiro?

200
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:35,648
Father won't let me
live here by myself.

201
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,652
I'll probably be in Nagoya
by the time you come.

202
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,821
- With an airplane company?
- Yes.

203
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,823
Men have it so good.

204
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,576
I want to study medicine in Tokyo.

205
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,080
A doctor? I think
you might be a good one.

206
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,082
I think so too.

207
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,960
I'll talk to Father
next time I'm home.

208
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,462
Thanks. I'm counting on you.

209
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:05,863
Jiro!

210
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,533
There you are.

211
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,077
- You made it.
- Finally.

212
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,746
- We're on our way.
- Yes, we are.

213
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:35,392
They must've been
heading for the city.

214
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,061
There were hundreds of them.

215
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,188
There's no work in the countryside.

216
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,946
Another bank failure.
Which one is it this time?

217
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,578
- Are those the customers?
- Looks like it.

218
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,081
There were rumors.

219
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:02,086
The economy's in the tank.
So is our new employer.

220
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:18,894
MITSUBISHI INTERNAL
COMBUSTION ENGINE CO.

221
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:24,567
We've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?

222
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,403
I was told to come
anytime in April.

223
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,281
Then you should've come in March!

224
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,242
I've got an assignment for you.

225
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,288
It's the design for the wing strut fitting.

226
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,791
I need it right away.
We're behind schedule already.

227
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,964
In here.

228
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,635
The data's ready.
This way.

229
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,312
This is your desk.

230
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,815
It's imported,
but no one likes it.

231
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,193
Data here, hat goes there.

232
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,779
Listen up! The Falcon Project
has a new engineer.

233
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:14,783
He's the genius we've all
been hearing about.

234
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,118
Introduce yourself.

235
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,162
Jiro Horikoshi.

236
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,331
Now get to work.

237
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,388
Jiro, come on.

238
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,266
It's lunchtime. Let's go.

239
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,022
- The assembly plant?
- Yes, I'd like to take a look.

240
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:13,777
Asking a green engineer to design
that fitting is practically hazing.

241
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,154
Two.

242
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,949
Excuse me.
Could we ask a favor?

243
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,618
Look, it's really coming along.

244
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,830
Sorry to bother you on your break.

245
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,959
Not at all. You young engineers
should visit us more often.

246
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:32,588
Honjo, the strut's already installed.

247
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,089
I knew it.

248
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:38,135
Kurokawa's just hazing you.
Is his fitting better than yours?

249
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,846
Mr. Kurokawa's always hard
on new employees.

250
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,183
Honjo, get up here
and take a look.

251
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,310
I need your opinion.

252
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,610
- What do you think?
- Looks strong enough.

253
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,988
This is no good.
It's just like my design.

254
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,865
Then it must be bad.

255
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,201
Foreman, lunch break's over.

256
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,827
Quiet.

257
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:07,164
Fascinating! Aircraft are fascinating!

258
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,375
Maybe they are, but we're late.

259
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,885
I'm Hattori.

260
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,058
Mr. Hattori is our chief engineer.

261
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,893
Is this his first assignment?

262
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,396
The strut fitting for the Falcon.

263
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,565
That's no fitting.
Explain yourself, young man.

264
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,820
Yes sir. This leaf spring
will absorb stress from the wing.

265
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,906
The wire expands
and contracts automatically.

266
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:45,244
It runs through the strut
to an anchor on the fuselage.

267
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,081
But we'd have to
redesign the wing!

268
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,084
You're right.
I haven't done the calculations yet.

269
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:56,255
You're wasting your time.
Where's the assignment I gave you?

270
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,589
It's finished.

271
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,098
That looks like
a very clean design to me.

272
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,684
It's perfect.

273
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,062
Submit your work
as soon as you finish!

274
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,110
- I'm heading out.
- Me too.

275
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,946
What about Kurokawa's homework?

276
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,281
Just finishing up.

277
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,454
Oxen!

278
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,873
They haul prototypes
to the airfield.

279
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:35,461
The latest aircraft, hauled by oxen.
That's how backward we are.

280
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,296
But they're wonderful creatures.

281
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,904
Here she comes.

282
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,031
Get ready!

283
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,702
Approaching the mark.

284
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,212
Damn it!

285
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:13,559
- Did you get it?
- 13.3 seconds. 145 knots.

286
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,228
Too slow.
We need ten more knots.

287
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:19,565
She's too low.
The engine's not performing.

288
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,568
Kurokawa!

289
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,404
Representatives from the Army.

290
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,114
An audacious design.

291
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,076
- Another coup for Mitsubishi.
- Your Falcon is quite impressive.

292
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,930
Power dive.
She's trying to break 200.

293
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,956
- Parachute's open.
- Go get him!

294
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:38,143
Mr. Kurokawa, we'll investigate
the cause when the weather clears.

295
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,312
- What about the pilot?
- He's okay.

296
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,647
That's good.

297
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:46,234
Mr. Kurokawa, let's go.
We'll build Falcon Two.

298
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,364
Do you think the strut fitting failed?

299
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:55,661
No. I think the problem
is deeper and more complicated.

300
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,664
I'll never forget what I saw today.

301
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,167
It's like an endless road is
opening up before my eyes.

302
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,671
There won't be a Falcon Two.

303
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,383
The Army has decided
to go with a competing design.

304
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,388
Today was our last chance
to change their minds.

305
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:19,017
We're going to build a bomber
with help from Junkers.

306
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,353
No more fighters for now.

307
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,359
This is your chance to see Germany.
I've already approved it.

308
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,439
- Still open?
- Ah, welcome back.

309
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:07,899
You're later than usual.

310
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,902
- Two slices of the usual.
- Coming up.

311
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,745
There you are.

312
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,913
Isn't anyone looking after them?

313
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:26,918
Their parents work late.
They wait there every night.

314
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,755
I feel bad closing the place up.

315
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,590
I see. Well, thanks.

316
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,091
Come again.

317
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,602
You must be hungry.
Here's something to eat.

318
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,605
It's sponge cake.
I just bought it.

319
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,619
Go ahead, take it.

320
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,454
Come on!

321
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:19,971
You here, Jiro?

322
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:25,977
Too bad about the Falcon.
I heard they axed it.

323
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:30,982
Sponge cake? You have
some strange eating habits.

324
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,328
What did you expect?

325
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:47,749
Did you think she was going to
smile and say thank you?

326
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,334
Of course not.

327
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,004
Well, maybe I did.

328
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,677
There are dozens of hungry kids
right here in this neighborhood.

329
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:04,891
The cost of one fitting would feed
that kid's family for a month.

330
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:08,019
Why is Japan so poor?

331
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:13,692
Jiro, do you know what we're paying
the Germans for their technology?

332
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:18,738
Enough to feed every kid in Japan,
with sponge cake for dessert.

333
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:22,868
Still, I plan to make the most
of this opportunity.

334
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,703
They're sending you too?

335
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,037
They told me today.

336
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,039
Really? That's great news.

337
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,167
Poor countries want airplanes.

338
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,713
So they pay us a lot
to design them. It's ironic.

339
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:39,217
I'm leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
Getting married.

340
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,677
Married?

341
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:45,223
To work hard at the office,
you need a family at home.

342
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,058
More irony.

343
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:27,599
Tight-fisted Germans.
They're hardly showing us anything.

344
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,601
I don't see any oxen.

345
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,937
The airstrip's
next to the plant.

346
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,939
Everything's so big.

347
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,381
It's the G-38.
Is this what we're buying?

348
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:02,801
For conversion to a bomber.
It's top secret.

349
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,137
Who's the Army planning
to bomb with this thing?

350
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,807
America, probably.
Not that they could.

351
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,478
Still, it's quite something.

352
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:14,854
Amazing.

353
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:19,359
Passengers can sit in the wings.
This would be wasted as a bomber.

354
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:24,489
Who cares? We need
their all-metal airframe technology.

355
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,162
You're kidding.
We can't go inside?

356
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,192
Beautiful.

357
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,243
Stop it.
Take your hands off him.

358
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,871
Is this how Germans
treat their guests?

359
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,208
You Japanese copy everything.
This technology belongs to Germany.

360
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:21,046
Oh, come on. Japan has
lots of planes like this.

361
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,672
Honjo, let it go.

362
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:27,052
We have a license
to your technology.

363
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,432
We signed an agreement.
We have the right to be here.

364
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,395
Your bosses never said
we couldn't inspect this airplane.

365
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,232
I'm sure you're only
trying to do your job...

366
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,571
but we won't tolerate this treatment.
The agreement is between equals.

367
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,909
Our orders were not to let
you Japanese wander around.

368
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,929
That's Dr. Junkers.

369
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,931
What an engineer.

370
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,269
You can go inside.
Dr. Junkers has agreed.

371
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,451
I'm surprised we got a demonstration.

372
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,620
There's more vibration
than I expected.

373
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,873
Our bosses are getting giddy.

374
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,293
Let the Army officers sit here.

375
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,299
Just a moment.

376
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,302
This is truly a stupendous aircraft.

377
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:55,640
Look, a corridor through the wing.

378
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,144
This is amazing.

379
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:03,148
It's like being inside a power plant.

380
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:11,322
Guten tag.
Dr. Junkers gave us permission.

381
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,616
Please show us your work station.

382
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,618
This is the flight engineer's station.

383
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,662
This aircraft is marvelous.

384
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,500
Japanese, do not go further.

385
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,337
Of course, my friend.

386
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,507
- This is incredible.
- Yes, it's fantastic.

387
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,844
A triumph of
German industrial technology.

388
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:08,379
Dr. Junkers is my hero,
but his company is sneaky.

389
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,217
Got a cigarette, Jiro?

390
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,719
Jiro!

391
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,056
A cigarette.

392
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,391
No. We're out.

393
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:40,411
It looks cold outside,
but this room is cozy.

394
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:44,082
I thought Germans used fireplaces.

395
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:49,254
Junkers makes radiators too.
This almost looks like that plane.

396
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,421
It's beautiful.

397
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:54,759
And our technology is primitive.
That's what you mean, right?

398
00:50:55,427 --> 00:51:00,265
You think we'll never figure out
all-metal construction on our own?

399
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:04,602
We can't learn anything from this.

400
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,939
These are just pretty equations.

401
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,609
"This technology belongs to Germany."

402
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:15,613
Maybe we don't even
need their technology.

403
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,449
Wood and canvas
could be as good as metal.

404
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:22,954
Then we'll never make it.
We're already 20 years behind.

405
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,294
Let's take a walk.

406
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,463
My brain is boiling.

407
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:44,934
We're Achilles, chasing a tortoise
with a twenty-year lead.

408
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:50,273
If we close the gap
in five years...

409
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,942
he'll be five more years
down the road.

410
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,279
We'll always be chasing him.

411
00:51:56,405 --> 00:52:01,242
Someday we'll overtake him
and move ahead.

412
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:05,121
I wonder if we
can be the tortoise.

413
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,962
What?

414
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,217
Listen to that.

415
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:27,143
Schubert's "Winter Journey".
It's perfect for us.

416
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:53,836
- What was that about?
- We saw him in the hangar.

417
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,397
<i>Jiro?</i>

418
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:58,401
I'm done. Go have a bath.

419
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,574
Dead to the world...

420
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:09,078
with a face like he's carrying
the future of Japanese aviation.

421
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,584
There's a telegram from headquarters.

422
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,461
- Come in.
- Not necessary.

423
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:20,756
Some of us are returning immediately.
You're staying behind.

424
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:24,260
Jiro will continue west
and return to Japan.

425
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,263
- West?
- They want him to see the world.

426
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,931
All by himself?

427
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:56,792
Mr. Caproni.

428
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,086
Is the wind still rising?

429
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:01,672
Yes, it is.

430
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:06,469
Then I invite you to join me
on my final flight. Come.

431
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,471
You're retiring?

432
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,807
It's a big jump.

433
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,313
Jump!

434
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,408
Hurry. We're taking off.

435
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:33,412
There's a hatch under the fuselage.

436
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:35,331
Hurry!

437
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,707
Let me through.

438
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,000
Up here!

439
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,011
- Full power!
- Fly! Fly!

440
00:55:56,311 --> 00:56:01,065
My workmen's families and relatives.
Practically the whole village.

441
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:03,693
We're taking a private jaunt...

442
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:07,530
before we deliver this bomber
to the Air Force.

443
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,038
- What do you think?
- It's incredible.

444
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,542
It's like a building
out of ancient Rome.

445
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:23,212
This plane is too large
to be used for war...

446
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,756
but the Air Force
likes everything big.

447
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,718
Japan is poor and backward.

448
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:32,722
We could never build
something like this.

449
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,850
The important thing
for an engineer is inspiration.

450
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:40,605
Inspiration unlocks the future.
Technology will catch up.

451
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,067
My wife and family.

452
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:50,072
We Italians are also poor.
Too many mouths to feed.

453
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,415
Hey, settle down.
The bottom will fall out.

454
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,417
Come.

455
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:10,259
Be careful. This may be a dream,
but you can still lose your head.

456
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:24,607
Which would you choose, a world with
pyramids or one without them?

457
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:26,150
Pyramids?

458
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:31,113
Humanity dreams of flight,
but the dream is cursed.

459
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:35,951
Aircraft are destined to become
tools for slaughter and destruction.

460
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,119
I know.

461
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:41,624
But still, I chose a world
with pyramids in it.

462
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,627
Which world will you choose?

463
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,130
I want to create beautiful airplanes.

464
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,632
Like that?

465
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,316
Very graceful.

466
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:11,779
I have a long way to go.
I don't even have the engine yet.

467
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:25,167
Bravo! A beautiful dream.

468
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:36,011
I'm retiring.
This is my last design.

469
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,515
Artists are only creative
for ten years.

470
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,685
We engineers are no different.

471
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:48,023
Live your ten years to the full.

472
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,709
Jiro, we need to talk.

473
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,878
- I've got a meeting.
- Cancel it.

474
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,731
- This is a tall order.
- They're always tall.

475
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:31,400
How long have you
been with us, Jiro?

476
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,903
Jiro?

477
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:36,405
- How long?
- Five years.

478
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:40,242
You should be ready, then.
We want you to lead the project.

479
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:43,913
It's the Navy's design competition
for 1932. A carrier-based fighter.

480
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:45,414
A plum assignment.

481
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,960
Well, Jiro?

482
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,765
What do you think?

483
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:04,475
Leave it to me.

484
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:05,935
Good.

485
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:08,103
I'd like Honjo on the team.

486
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,480
Bad idea.

487
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:13,275
You'd end up competing.
Friendship's more important.

488
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,778
Relax and finish your coffee.

489
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,280
Check, please.

490
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:21,450
We've got other plans for Honjo.

491
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,999
Damn these Japanese engines!

492
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,845
And damn this short flight deck.

493
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,184
Fresh uniforms!

494
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,228
Oh, thanks.

495
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,867
Thanks for your help.

496
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,201
Those jerseys suit you.

497
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:15,064
Close the flight deck!

498
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,284
Stop!

499
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:12,848
We did it!

500
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:14,683
She's airborne!

501
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,917
Father!

502
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:11,341
Bravo! Nice catch.

503
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:18,140
That was kind of you.
Are you all right?

504
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:19,808
I'm fine. Here you are.

505
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:22,978
Thank you.
It belongs to the hotel.

506
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,479
Well, goodbye.

507
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:40,996
Father, I'm afraid
I was rude to that man.

508
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:43,332
Don't worry.
He's staying at our hotel.

509
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:46,543
You'll have a chance
to say thank you.

510
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:32,834
What is it?

511
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:36,838
Nothing. Just that man
who caught the parasol.

512
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:40,008
He seems to be here by himself.

513
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,290
I'm sorry. I'd better go.

514
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:59,087
No, please stay.
I was giving thanks to the spring.

515
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:03,425
I asked it
to bring you here, to me.

516
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:11,475
You haven't changed at all.
You're just like you were then.

517
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:15,979
We were so grateful
for your help after the earthquake.

518
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:19,316
I wanted to see you
again and thank you.

519
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:21,485
Oh, now I remember.

520
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,488
My name is Nahoko Satomi.

521
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,324
Jiro Horikoshi.

522
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,847
Are you all right?

523
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,349
I'm fine.

524
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:58,688
Kinu got married two days after
she dropped off your shirt.

525
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,442
She cried for joy
when we found you.

526
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:06,029
You were our knight
in shining armor.

527
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,197
Your knight?

528
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:10,700
You were like a knight on a
white horse that day.

529
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,537
This umbrella sure does leak.

530
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,205
It's all right.

531
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,207
I've got to tell Kinu.

532
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,710
She just had her second child.

533
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,837
It's such a cute baby.

534
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:28,552
Your painting is all wet.

535
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:31,721
Yes. I'll keep it this way
in honor of today.

536
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,057
Look, it's clearing up.

537
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,732
The rain stopped here.

538
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,570
Oh, look at that.

539
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,080
I'd almost forgotten
what rainbows look like.

540
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,583
Life is wonderful, isn't it?

541
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,254
We'd better go.
Father's probably worried sick.

542
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,093
There's my father.

543
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,596
Father!

544
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:16,099
Come, I'll introduce you.

545
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,270
You're soaking wet.

546
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:25,442
Don't worry, Father. I'm fine.
Mr. Horikoshi saved me again.

547
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:26,943
Jiro Horikoshi.

548
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:31,573
Satomi. I'm afraid my daughter has
caused you trouble again.

549
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,828
May I sit here?

550
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:21,831
Certainly.

551
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:42,936
German tobacco. Last one. Too bad.

552
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:48,191
I know how you feel.
The same thing happened to me.

553
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:52,946
You visit Germany, yes? To Dessau.

554
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,449
You must be Sherlock Holmes.

555
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:58,868
You are an engineer.

556
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:03,206
You read German magazines.
Magazines about airplanes.

557
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:07,210
All Japanese engineers visit Dessau.

558
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:11,214
You're exactly right.

559
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,511
- Dr. Junkers is in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

560
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:22,225
He fights the government.
He will blow up.

561
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:24,728
Mr. Hitler's government?

562
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:28,231
The Nazis are a gang of hoodlums.

563
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,067
This is a good place.

564
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:35,739
No mosquitoes.
Not hot. Good watercress.

565
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:38,700
A good place to forget bad things.

566
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:41,244
Cigarette? I'm afraid they're Japanese.

567
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,579
Thank you.

568
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:52,255
It is a nice night.
Hier ist der Zauberberg.

569
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,466
"The Magic Mountain"
by Thomas Mann?

570
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,260
A good place for forgetting.

571
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,597
Make a war in China. Forget it.

572
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:03,850
Make a puppet state
in Manchuria. Forget it.

573
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,270
Quit the League of Nations. Forget it.

574
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:10,106
Make the world your enemy. Forget it.

575
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:12,776
Japan will blow up.

576
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:15,779
Germany will blow up too.

577
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:20,450
- Will Germany go to war again?
- Yes. They must be stopped.

578
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:24,662
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting so long.

579
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,290
Nahoko has a fever.

580
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,460
I'm afraid we'll have to
cancel our dinner plans.

581
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,464
I'm sorry. Please tell her
I hope she feels better.

582
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,801
I must go.
The doctor will be here soon.

583
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:36,419
"Who has seen the wind?"

584
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,589
"Neither I nor you."

585
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:44,761
"But when the leaves hang trembling,
the wind is passing through."

586
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:52,602
Let the wind carry...

587
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,813
these wings to you.

588
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:33,351
Jiro?

589
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,811
Nahoko!

590
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:56,666
Be careful!

591
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:57,703
Nice catch.

592
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:14,530
Bravo!

593
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,366
Is the young lady feeling better?

594
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,869
Yes, she's much better.

595
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,370
Congratulations.

596
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:25,208
This is the magic mountain.
It cures everyone.

597
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,376
I think you're right.

598
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:32,215
At first, this young man
was very gloomy.

599
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,383
Now he is very happy.

600
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,594
He has fallen in love.

601
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:38,554
That's true.

602
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,558
Summer love is soon forgotten.

603
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:46,395
You will go down the mountain.
You will forget what happened here.

604
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,564
Not me.

605
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:53,402
This person you're talking about
wouldn't be my daughter, would it?

606
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,738
Yes, it's Nahoko.

607
01:23:57,532 --> 01:24:00,117
Please give us your permission.

608
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:02,745
But...

609
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,080
Father!

610
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,167
I would like to accept.

611
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,419
What a beauty.

612
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:16,759
But first, there's something
I have to tell you.

613
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:17,885
Yes?

614
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:22,098
Two years ago,
my mother died of tuberculosis.

615
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:25,101
I contracted it too.

616
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:29,855
I've loved you since
that day you rescued my hat.

617
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:34,277
I've loved you since the wind
brought you to me.

618
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,779
Please marry me.

619
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:37,905
I will.

620
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:42,118
But I want to get well first.
Can you wait for me?

621
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:45,121
Even if it takes
a hundred years.

622
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,290
Congratulations.

623
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:52,044
He is a nice young man.
Your daughter is wonderful.

624
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:56,007
This is a good summer.

625
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,324
- Jiro, over here!
- Honjo!

626
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,659
- When did you get back?
- Two days ago.

627
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,328
Hot, isn't it?

628
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:29,999
Come take a look.

629
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,172
She's beautiful.

630
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,341
Good clean lines.

631
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:45,848
It's a radical design.
They gave me free rein.

632
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,185
But we won't know
until she flies.

633
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:53,189
She'll fly.
I feel the wind rising.

634
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:18,214
You're the Japanese Achilles.
You've closed the gap.

635
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,050
My plane was just a tin duckling.

636
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:22,885
I have an idea for you.

637
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:25,554
I haven't tried it yet.

638
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,893
Use flathead screws
on the access hatches.

639
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,728
They'll reduce drag.

640
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:37,400
Maintenance will be easy
with a hinge on one side.

641
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:45,408
A spring about this stiff
should be fine.

642
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:49,328
That's a great idea,
like Columbus and his egg.

643
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:50,579
You should use it.

644
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,249
Thanks, but not this time.

645
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,710
I'll keep the plans.

646
01:26:56,878 --> 01:27:00,089
After you use it,
I'll use it too.

647
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,258
Okay.

648
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,885
Hurry up, I'll be waiting.

649
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:07,763
Jiro! Are you here?

650
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,766
Jiro, it's Mr. Kurokawa.

651
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:12,101
It's an emergency.

652
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:13,436
See you.

653
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:15,438
Visit the house next time.

654
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,273
Jiro, you pedal.

655
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,947
The Special Police
are looking for you.

656
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,284
The thought crime boys.

657
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,119
Why me?

658
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,455
I told them you were
away on business.

659
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:46,635
Pretending to leave?
We won't fall for that.

660
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:49,472
You'd better work here.
We'll bring your things.

661
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:52,475
What's going on?
Why are they after me?

662
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:57,980
They arrested some of my friends.
None of them understood why.

663
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:00,483
Come in.

664
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:01,984
Here's your stuff.

665
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,821
Sorry for the bother.

666
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,490
Need anything else?

667
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:10,493
- Just leave it and go.
- Jiro, it's here!

668
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:12,495
The prototype flange.

669
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:24,340
It looks great.

670
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:26,342
Wish we'd had it last year.

671
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:28,135
Jiro, what do you think?

672
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:32,515
Our next plane will be
a full-grown duck, not a duckling.

673
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,851
A full metal duck.

674
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:37,603
How about it, Mr. Kurokawa?

675
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:42,191
Extruded aluminum alloy.
Very light. What a luxury.

676
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:43,943
All right, back to work.

677
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:58,541
- The coast looks clear.
- Okay, Jiro.

678
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:03,045
Better lie low for a few days.

679
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,214
We'll smooth things over.

680
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,049
I'll put you up.

681
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:10,177
Let me stop by my apartment.
I'm expecting a letter.

682
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:12,555
Is it something sensitive?

683
01:29:12,681 --> 01:29:14,223
Yes, very sensitive.

684
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:16,559
The police will be opening your mail.

685
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:18,143
It's from my fiancée.

686
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:21,897
Such things shouldn't happen
in a modern country.

687
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:25,401
You're engaged?

688
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:28,404
- Jiro's human after all.
- Splendid.

689
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:30,739
You think Japan's a modern country?

690
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:32,283
It's not funny.

691
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:35,911
Of course it's not funny.
The police are waiting for you.

692
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:38,289
Let them read your love letters.

693
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:41,917
The Navy's next design
competition is in your hands.

694
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:46,922
The company will protect you.
That is, as long as you're useful.

695
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:49,425
Just keep your mind on work.

696
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:54,096
<i>I miss you terribly.
And "Mr. Castorp" left so suddenly.</i>

697
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:57,600
<i>Why are they looking for him?</i>

698
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:15,034
<i>I pray that he managed to
leave Japan safely.</i>

699
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:34,136
Jiro, telephone for you.

700
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:35,804
Coming.

701
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,641
- The telephone is there.
- Thank you.

702
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:44,480
- Hello?
<i>- Jiro? You have a telegram.</i>

703
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:45,606
What?

704
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:50,152
<i>Your landlord brought it.
It came two days ago.</i>

705
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:51,820
Please read it.

706
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:53,155
<i>Are you sure?</i>

707
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:59,912
"Nahoko... has had
a lung... hemorrhage."

708
01:31:00,038 --> 01:31:02,498
"Please come at once.
Satomi"

709
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:11,340
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

710
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:14,176
I understand. Thank you.

711
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:15,844
<i>Wait, hold on!</i>

712
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:19,682
What is it?

713
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:23,936
What's the fastest way
to get to Tokyo?

714
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,521
To Tokyo?

715
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:28,190
I have to be there
as soon as possible.

716
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:30,025
Let me see.

717
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:34,363
If you take the noon bus,
you can catch the express.

718
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:37,533
I'll send someone
to hold the bus for you.

719
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:39,201
Jiya!

720
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:27,810
Darling!

721
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:39,988
I wish I could've
come sooner.

722
01:33:45,662 --> 01:33:47,162
You'll catch it.

723
01:33:47,497 --> 01:33:48,831
You're beautiful.

724
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:50,999
I love you.

725
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:55,170
Jiro? Through the garden?

726
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:06,181
Come in.

727
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:10,853
Father, Jiro came to see me.

728
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:13,522
But he has to leave right away.

729
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:18,193
- Next time I'll use the front door.
- Use the garden, it's more fun.

730
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:20,195
All right, I will.

731
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,531
Take care, darling.

732
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:24,199
You too.

733
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,202
Goodbye.

734
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,537
I'll see you out.

735
01:34:33,877 --> 01:34:36,879
The last train?
You'd better hurry.

736
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:42,551
Is it that serious?
I wish I could look after her.

737
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:46,054
The way to do that is
to focus on your work.

738
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:47,890
Now you'd better go.

739
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:56,899
He's gone.

740
01:34:57,901 --> 01:34:59,902
Are you crying, dear?

741
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:07,242
I'm going to the sanatorium
the doctor recommended.

742
01:35:07,577 --> 01:35:10,913
But it's so lonely.
You'll be all by yourself.

743
01:35:11,748 --> 01:35:13,415
I want to get better.

744
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,751
I want a life with Jiro.

745
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:24,426
You're just in time.
The board is waiting.

746
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:33,185
So, are you ready?

747
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:35,687
I'll do my best.

748
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:38,607
Now the Navy.
They're the client.

749
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:51,203
I'll do my best.

750
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:53,956
- You weren't even listening.
- Right.

751
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:58,627
So I gave up on that idea.

752
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:04,800
- Everyone's here rather late.
- Jiro's holding a design seminar.

753
01:36:07,095 --> 01:36:10,305
The next design uses
all the latest technology.

754
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:13,475
- Take a look.
- Retractable undercarriage!

755
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:16,144
We'll need it for 270 knots.

756
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:19,606
270 knots?
That's 500 kilometers an hour!

757
01:36:19,983 --> 01:36:22,359
I thought the Navy
requested 220 knots.

758
01:36:22,986 --> 01:36:25,320
We're designing for the future.

759
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:28,490
Wing loading is 120 kilos
per square meter.

760
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:33,161
We'll minimize drag
and push the limits of technology.

761
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:36,665
She'll have split flaps
and leading edge slats.

762
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:55,017
We can do it!

763
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:57,394
When do we start?

764
01:36:58,187 --> 01:37:00,397
But then weight becomes a problem.

765
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:06,528
If we leave out the guns,
we should be okay.

766
01:37:12,869 --> 01:37:16,038
I decided to set
this idea aside for now.

767
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:19,207
This is delightful.
Lucid and logical.

768
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:20,792
Almost had it.

769
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:23,336
Our engines are underpowered.

770
01:37:23,463 --> 01:37:26,548
To compensate, we need
a light, strong structure.

771
01:37:26,716 --> 01:37:30,886
We'll cut excess weight
and minimize drag with a smooth skin.

772
01:37:31,054 --> 01:37:33,722
We're going to build
an all-metal fighter...

773
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:36,058
like nothing the world's ever seen.

774
01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:38,226
I have a question!

775
01:37:38,561 --> 01:37:40,062
Mr. Hirayama, please.

776
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:44,232
Mr. Hirayama is our production engineer.

777
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:45,525
Thank you.

778
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:50,739
He's going to tell us
about the new rivets.

779
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:57,037
It's technically possible to build
strong structures with flush rivets.

780
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:58,580
What's he talking about?

781
01:37:59,082 --> 01:38:00,540
A way to cut drag.

782
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:06,129
We're going to skin
the whole aircraft with flush rivets.

783
01:38:06,255 --> 01:38:08,590
- Question!
- I have a question!

784
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:13,428
I must say, that was interesting.

785
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:15,097
It was inspiring.

786
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:37,452
Today's letter, Miss Satomi.

787
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:39,454
Thank you.

788
01:39:59,035 --> 01:40:00,535
Phone call, Chief.

789
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:03,830
- I'll call back.
- I think it's an emergency.

790
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:07,209
Hello? Mr. Satomi?

791
01:40:07,877 --> 01:40:09,377
What?!

792
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:24,286
Jiro! Jiro!

793
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:28,123
Thank goodness.
I worried I wouldn't find you.

794
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:32,627
I'm here now. Can you walk?

795
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:34,963
Let's go.

796
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:45,307
I just had to see you.
I should go right back.

797
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:46,308
Don't go.

798
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:51,813
We should be together.

799
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:07,162
- What a charming companion.
- My name is Nahoko.

800
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,998
- So you're Nahoko.
- Jiro, is that you?

801
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:12,334
We've come to you
with a request.

802
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:15,337
Why not, dear? It'll be fine.

803
01:42:15,504 --> 01:42:17,172
We've got plenty of room...

804
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:22,510
but I can hardly approve of
an unmarried couple living together.

805
01:42:23,179 --> 01:42:24,679
We'll get married right away.

806
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:27,766
Mr. Kurokawa, Mrs. Kurokawa,
please be our witnesses.

807
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:29,351
Here? Tonight?

808
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:31,519
It sounds lovely, dear.

809
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:35,023
Nahoko was very brave
to leave the sanatorium.

810
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:39,527
My father's given his permission.
I've already told the doctor.

811
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:41,029
Please help us.

812
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:46,701
The bride and I have
preparations to make.

813
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:48,703
Come with me, Nahoko.

814
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,379
Don't worry, he's always like that.

815
01:43:01,384 --> 01:43:06,221
If you care about her,
you'll send her back immediately.

816
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:11,559
I can't do that.
I'd have to give up my work.

817
01:43:11,894 --> 01:43:15,063
Is that your heart
or your ego talking?

818
01:43:16,065 --> 01:43:19,317
We don't have much time.
We've made our decision.

819
01:43:20,569 --> 01:43:21,736
I see.

820
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:25,073
All right.
We'll have a real ceremony!

821
01:43:49,849 --> 01:43:51,099
Here they come.

822
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,601
She's coming!

823
01:44:12,955 --> 01:44:18,126
Hear me! This lovely maiden
has traveled far to join her beloved.

824
01:44:18,461 --> 01:44:23,798
She's given up everything
in the world for him. What say you?

825
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:27,302
Hear me! This man is
an insensitive simpleton...

826
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,637
without a home
of his own.

827
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:33,141
If that's... uh, okay with you,
please come in.

828
01:44:33,309 --> 01:44:36,811
Then they shall exchange
the marriage vows.

829
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:00,835
You look beautiful.

830
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:39,541
Mr. and Mrs. Kurokawa.

831
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:44,879
No words can express
our gratitude for your kindness.

832
01:45:45,381 --> 01:45:47,549
We will never forget our debt to you.

833
01:45:50,386 --> 01:45:55,390
Come now, we're delighted that
Jiro's found such a wonderful partner.

834
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:56,558
Aren't we, dear?

835
01:45:56,725 --> 01:46:00,895
Of course. This is wonderful.
You're both very courageous.

836
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:18,079
You must be tired.

837
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:22,584
I feel like I'm dreaming.
The room is spinning.

838
01:46:22,918 --> 01:46:25,044
Better get some rest.

839
01:46:26,255 --> 01:46:27,171
Come here.

840
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:28,923
But your condition...

841
01:46:31,093 --> 01:46:32,260
Come.

842
01:47:14,053 --> 01:47:16,638
Do you always
get home this late?

843
01:47:16,764 --> 01:47:18,348
Kayo, I completely forgot.

844
01:47:18,724 --> 01:47:20,600
You're so insensitive.

845
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:24,937
Congratulations on becoming a doctor.

846
01:47:25,064 --> 01:47:27,940
Congratulations on your marriage.

847
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:31,778
I came on behalf of the family
to thank the Kurokawas.

848
01:47:32,071 --> 01:47:33,279
Are they still up?

849
01:47:33,489 --> 01:47:34,947
They've gone to bed.

850
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,283
- Did you meet Nahoko?
- Yes.

851
01:47:41,246 --> 01:47:46,125
What are you going to do?
She's alone in that room all day.

852
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:50,088
Her condition is
much worse than you think.

853
01:47:50,255 --> 01:47:53,132
I'm an intern.
I know something about this.

854
01:47:53,759 --> 01:47:58,971
Did you notice she uses rouge
every morning so you won't worry?

855
01:48:00,432 --> 01:48:03,976
I really like Nahoko.
She's such a good person.

856
01:48:04,103 --> 01:48:06,270
How can you do this to her?

857
01:48:10,818 --> 01:48:13,152
Does she really have to stay here?

858
01:48:13,278 --> 01:48:14,320
Yes.

859
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:19,659
Each day is very precious to us now.

860
01:48:22,121 --> 01:48:25,164
Get some rest.
I'm glad you came to visit.

861
01:48:40,472 --> 01:48:41,681
I'm home.

862
01:48:41,807 --> 01:48:44,016
- I was waiting.
- You should sleep.

863
01:48:50,315 --> 01:48:53,526
- Should you be up?
- Kayo came today.

864
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:56,529
We're already best friends.

865
01:48:57,656 --> 01:49:01,534
She's like the sun,
with such a bright future.

866
01:49:01,994 --> 01:49:06,038
She said next time,
she'll come as my doctor.

867
01:49:07,499 --> 01:49:12,211
And your mother made me
a chemise and a nightgown.

868
01:49:12,671 --> 01:49:14,589
Look, they're so warm.

869
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:16,799
Too bright?

870
01:49:17,676 --> 01:49:18,801
It's all right.

871
01:49:21,013 --> 01:49:23,389
I have to finish
the design by tomorrow.

872
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:24,891
For your mackerel bones?

873
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:26,726
You remembered.

874
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:30,396
I think it could
be a little lighter.

875
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:34,442
Come a little closer.

876
01:49:43,869 --> 01:49:45,411
Give me your hand.

877
01:49:48,707 --> 01:49:52,919
I like to look at you
while you work.

878
01:49:53,545 --> 01:49:58,257
In a one-handed slide rule contest,
I'd win first prize for sure.

879
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:02,428
I think I can make each rib
half an ounce lighter.

880
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:04,430
Really? That's good.

881
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:06,766
Thirty ribs makes about a pound.

882
01:50:07,059 --> 01:50:08,392
That's too much.

883
01:50:08,894 --> 01:50:11,395
Half a pound is enough for two.

884
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:16,108
I could eat a pound
of mackerel by myself.

885
01:50:21,907 --> 01:50:24,283
I'll keep holding your hand.
You should sleep.

886
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:27,620
- You won't let go?
- No, I won't.

887
01:50:30,082 --> 01:50:33,459
I need a cigarette.
Can I let go for a minute?

888
01:50:33,752 --> 01:50:36,128
No. Smoke it here.

889
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:38,631
- It's not good for you.
- I don't care.

890
01:50:58,110 --> 01:50:59,652
Hey, Honjo.

891
01:50:59,945 --> 01:51:01,320
Can I take a look?

892
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:04,532
- Sure. How's your bomber?
- Coming along fine.

893
01:51:04,783 --> 01:51:08,828
This is avant garde.
You went all the way.

894
01:51:12,124 --> 01:51:14,333
So this is flush riveting.

895
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,169
Feels pretty rough.

896
01:51:18,297 --> 01:51:20,006
We're still learning the technique.

897
01:51:20,299 --> 01:51:25,177
You've left the Germans behind.
I'm still stuck with them.

898
01:51:27,723 --> 01:51:31,976
This design is you,
right down to the mackerel bones.

899
01:51:34,313 --> 01:51:39,525
Jiro, let me use flush rivets too.
And your spring-loaded hatches.

900
01:51:39,651 --> 01:51:41,360
Sure. Why not?

901
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:42,695
A redesign?

902
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:47,033
Yeah, but they're only letting me
modify the fuselage.

903
01:51:47,492 --> 01:51:48,868
And leave the wings alone?

904
01:51:49,161 --> 01:51:52,246
That's where the fuel tanks are.
One hit, and boom.

905
01:51:52,831 --> 01:51:56,542
To save weight, we're not even
shielding the fuel tanks.

906
01:51:56,668 --> 01:52:00,671
It's Japan's first advanced bomber.
The Navy's over the moon.

907
01:52:02,674 --> 01:52:06,552
She's got to fly 3,000 kilometers
with a big payload.

908
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:09,555
More horsepower alone won't be enough.

909
01:52:22,778 --> 01:52:24,570
Who are they going to fight?

910
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:28,741
China. Russia. Britain.
The Netherlands. America.

911
01:52:28,867 --> 01:52:30,242
Japan will blow up.

912
01:52:31,203 --> 01:52:35,081
We're not arms merchants.
We just want to build good aircraft.

913
01:52:35,207 --> 01:52:36,082
You're right.

914
01:52:36,208 --> 01:52:38,084
See you. Get some sleep.

915
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:40,127
Sure. You too.

916
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:42,755
I'm leaving now.

917
01:52:43,048 --> 01:52:44,256
Good night.

918
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:45,800
Night.

919
01:53:11,076 --> 01:53:12,618
Welcome home.

920
01:53:13,078 --> 01:53:16,122
It's finished.
Now we'll see how she flies.

921
01:53:16,415 --> 01:53:19,458
Congratulations.
You worked so hard.

922
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:23,004
She's on her way to the field.

923
01:53:23,255 --> 01:53:25,798
I'll probably spend
a few nights there.

924
01:53:26,758 --> 01:53:28,467
You must be tired.

925
01:53:30,762 --> 01:53:32,263
A little.

926
01:53:32,431 --> 01:53:34,473
I'm sure it will fly beautifully.

927
01:53:34,933 --> 01:53:37,268
Yes, she'll fly.

928
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,855
I couldn't have done it without you.

929
01:53:41,273 --> 01:53:43,315
I love you, Jiro.

930
01:53:44,109 --> 01:53:45,484
Nahoko...

931
01:54:38,663 --> 01:54:39,872
I'm off.

932
01:54:39,998 --> 01:54:41,373
Good luck.

933
01:55:07,859 --> 01:55:09,610
Why, Nahoko. You're up.

934
01:55:10,153 --> 01:55:14,907
I'm feeling much better today.
I'm going for a walk.

935
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:17,910
Just be careful
not to tire yourself.

936
01:55:19,037 --> 01:55:23,249
The room's still a mess.
I'll straighten up when I get back.

937
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:25,918
All right. Enjoy yourself.

938
01:55:26,044 --> 01:55:28,754
Kayo's coming today.
That will be nice.

939
01:55:29,047 --> 01:55:30,923
Yes. I'll be back soon.

940
01:56:12,424 --> 01:56:14,466
Please come in.

941
01:56:20,599 --> 01:56:22,474
Oh, no.

942
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:34,403
Look, she left letters!
One of them's for me.

943
01:56:40,285 --> 01:56:44,496
She's going to the sanatorium!
I'll bring her back.

944
01:56:44,789 --> 01:56:46,165
No! Let her go.

945
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:52,671
We shouldn't do anything
until her train leaves.

946
01:56:54,299 --> 01:56:58,010
She wants him
to remember her as she was.

947
01:57:44,933 --> 01:57:48,686
This is wonderful.
Just think, that's one of ours.

948
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:50,896
How's her speed?

949
01:57:51,189 --> 01:57:54,483
Sorry, the numbers are too high.
We're checking them again.

950
01:57:54,693 --> 01:57:55,901
How fast?

951
01:57:56,027 --> 01:57:59,238
- 240 knots.
- Two forty!

952
01:58:34,441 --> 01:58:37,443
- Fantastic!
- What a fighter.

953
01:58:38,737 --> 01:58:40,112
Hey, Jiro.

954
01:58:40,572 --> 01:58:41,780
Jiro!

955
01:58:49,748 --> 01:58:52,624
She flies like a dream.
Thank you.

956
02:00:05,365 --> 02:00:08,742
We meet again, Japanese boy.

957
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:11,203
Mr. Caproni...

958
02:00:14,916 --> 02:00:18,043
This is where we first met.

959
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:20,546
Our kingdom of dreams.

960
02:00:21,089 --> 02:00:22,714
Or the land of the dead.

961
02:00:22,841 --> 02:00:25,717
Not quite. In some ways, yes.

962
02:00:26,177 --> 02:00:30,139
Those ten years in the sun,
did you live them to the full?

963
02:00:30,265 --> 02:00:33,058
Yes. Things fell apart
toward the end, though.

964
02:00:33,351 --> 02:00:35,853
That's what it means to lose a war.

965
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:38,564
There's your Zero fighter.

966
02:01:16,019 --> 02:01:18,770
Beautiful. A masterful design.

967
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:21,440
Not a single plane returned.

968
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:24,109
There was nothing
to come back to.

969
02:01:24,402 --> 02:01:27,404
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
Cursed dreams...

970
02:01:27,655 --> 02:01:29,990
waiting for the sky
to swallow them up.

971
02:01:31,659 --> 02:01:33,452
Someone is waiting for you.

972
02:01:48,635 --> 02:01:49,635
Nahoko...

973
02:01:49,928 --> 02:01:53,096
She's been waiting here
for a long time.

974
02:01:53,598 --> 02:01:55,974
Darling, you must live.

975
02:02:00,313 --> 02:02:01,480
You must live...

976
02:02:23,795 --> 02:02:25,671
She is gone.

977
02:02:27,131 --> 02:02:29,508
She was beautiful, like the wind.

978
02:02:30,969 --> 02:02:32,344
Thank you.

979
02:02:33,471 --> 02:02:34,680
Thank you.

980
02:02:36,224 --> 02:02:38,350
You must live.

981
02:02:38,643 --> 02:02:43,230
First, shall we drop by my house?
I have some excellent wine.
