1
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:22,830
THE WIND RISES

2
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:30,838
The wind is rising!
We must try to live.

3
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,732
Here it is.

4
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,948
May I borrow it?

5
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,784
- It's in English.
- I have a dictionary.

6
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,453
- Very good. Give it a go.
- Thank you.

7
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,141
- Knock it off.
- Butt out!

8
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,809
Better get going.

9
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,644
Jiro...

10
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,272
No more bullying, okay?

11
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,458
You look quite the hero.

12
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,836
I slipped and fell.

13
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,339
- Fighting is never justified.
- I know.

14
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,593
Go have your snack.

15
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,344
Thank you.

16
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,515
Big brother, you're back!

17
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,979
I was waiting for you.
Let's pick bamboo grass.

18
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,982
Big brother!

19
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,529
I want to pick bamboo grass.

20
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,703
You promised to go with me.

21
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,079
I've got homework.

22
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,296
That's not homework.

23
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,839
It's an English magazine.

24
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,844
What a stupid moustache.

25
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,889
He's a famous Italian
aircraft designer.

26
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,727
His name is Caproni.
It says he's a count.

27
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:04,022
- Your face is scratched.
- Leave it alone.

28
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,858
I better put some iodine on it.

29
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,902
Would you be quiet?

30
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,082
Big brother, what are you doing?

31
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,917
You're not allowed up here.

32
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,585
You're not wearing glasses.

33
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:30,090
Focusing on the stars
should improve my eyesight.

34
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,761
- Mother will scold you.
- A shooting star!

35
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,847
There's another one.

36
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,435
They're pretty.
See? Like that.

37
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,939
There's so many of them.

38
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,145
I'm a Japanese boy.

39
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,445
I think this is my dream.

40
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,505
This is my dream, you know.

41
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,424
It's mine too.

42
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,009
Your dream?

43
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:00,680
Listen, Japanese boy. You think
we are sharing this dream?

44
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,015
It's strange.

45
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,519
You're Count Caproni, aren't you?
I'm very glad to meet you.

46
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:12,192
Interesting. Yes, this is a dream.
This world is a dream.

47
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,194
Welcome to my kingdom.

48
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,862
I'm honored.

49
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,865
Look at them.

50
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:28,124
They will bomb the enemy city.
Most of them won't return.

51
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,384
But the war will soon be over.

52
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,228
Climb up, Japanese boy.

53
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,943
This is my dream. When the war
is over, I will build this.

54
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,863
Magnificent, isn't she?

55
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,907
Let's fly.

56
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,664
Instead of bombs,
she'll carry passengers.

57
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,592
Of course we can't climb up here...

58
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,762
but dreams are convenient.
One can go anywhere.

59
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,982
Come, join me.
You can walk along the spar.

60
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,280
Take a look.

61
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:19,319
- She's beautiful, no?
- Yes, incredible.

62
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,577
She'll carry a hundred people
across the Atlantic.

63
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,831
Mr. Caproni?
I have a question.

64
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,336
Do you think I could
design airplanes?

65
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,841
I'll never be a pilot.
I'm too nearsighted.

66
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,512
Listen, Japanese boy.

67
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,015
I'm not a pilot.
I don't even know how to fly.

68
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,019
To fly airplanes is simple.

69
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,774
But I am a creator of airplanes.
An aeronautical engineer!

70
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,317
Yes!

71
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,694
Listen to me, Japanese boy.

72
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:06,199
Airplanes are not tools for war.
They are not for making money.

73
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,868
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.

74
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,163
Engineers turn dreams into reality.

75
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,665
Yes!

76
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,793
Arrivederci. We'll meet again.

77
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:34,060
Jiro, you should go to bed.

78
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:39,899
You startled me.
I heard you talking to someone.

79
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,403
Mother, I'm going to be
an aeronautical engineer.

80
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,406
Really? That's a wonderful dream.

81
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:50,159
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
That's what he told me.

82
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,704
I want to design
beautiful airplanes.

83
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,068
You, there.
Come, take my seat.

84
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,278
Pardon me.

85
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,529
Please.

86
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,817
The wind feels wonderful.

87
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,737
Miss, you'll lose your hat.

88
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,988
Don't worry, Kinu.

89
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,998
Watch out!

90
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,336
Are you all right?

91
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,129
Safe!

92
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,964
Nice play.

93
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,050
Thank you.

94
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,344
"Le vent se lève."

95
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,181
"Il faut tenter de vivre."

96
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,334
"Le vent se lève.
Il faut tenter de vivre."

97
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,714
"The wind is rising.
We must try to live."

98
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,226
Earthquake.

99
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,489
The boiler's going to blow!

100
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,459
- What's wrong?
- Her leg.

101
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,794
Show me.

102
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,130
It hurts.

103
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,590
Kinu, be brave.

104
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,385
It's broken.
She can't walk like this.

105
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,638
Miss, the boiler.
Please save yourself.

106
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,306
That's nonsense.

107
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,977
Nothing's going to explode.

108
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,480
My suitcase.

109
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,197
Now, try to relax.

110
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,997
She can't walk.
Where do you live?

111
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,666
- In Ueno.
- I'll get you there.

112
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,347
- Fire.
- Let's go.

113
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,449
- What about your luggage?
- It's not important.

114
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,390
I'm so sorry.

115
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,892
Hang on!

116
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,445
We'd better hurry.

117
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,617
One of my shirts.
It's brand new.

118
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,285
You must be thirsty.

119
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,251
The well's almost dry.
What about you?

120
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,502
Thank you.

121
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,635
The fire hasn't reached Ueno.

122
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,346
I'm heading for the university.
What about you?

123
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,515
I'll bring someone from home.

124
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,851
I'll go with you.

125
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,812
- Look after this, Kinu.
- I will.

126
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,231
We'll be back soon.
Don't worry.

127
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,608
Watch my suitcase.

128
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,776
- Thank you.
- I'll leave her to you.

129
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,778
But what's your name?

130
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,119
That was some guy.
Don't you think, Kinu?

131
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,764
Jiro! You picked a great day
to come back.

132
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,474
How bad is it, Honjo?

133
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,144
The whole east side is burning.

134
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,565
That's everything we could carry.

135
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,108
Got a smoke?

136
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:33,617
A flying door? That's just great.
They'll never stop the fire now.

137
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,452
Tokyo's finished.

138
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,971
He really built it.
Caproni has giant dreams.

139
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,575
Stop the camera!

140
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,378
The wind's shifting.
It's coming this way.

141
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,343
Is the wind still rising,
Japanese boy?

142
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,388
Yes, it's a gale.

143
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:21,517
Then you must live.
"Le vent se lève."

144
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,061
"II faut tenter de vivre."

145
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,456
Hey Jiro. Ready?

146
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,211
All the new buildings
are old-fashioned.

147
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,464
The streets are wider.

148
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,841
Even the airplanes haven't changed.

149
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,470
Welcome!

150
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,018
Mackerel again?

151
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,644
It's great.

152
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,647
Every day's the same.
Same lunch, same lectures.

153
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,816
Can I get an egg?

154
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,153
The Western powers
are building all-metal aircraft.

155
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,781
Try the pork sometime.

156
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,784
We're more than ten years behind.

157
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,161
What?

158
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,704
Beautiful, isn't it?

159
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,665
Look at that wonderful curve.

160
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,710
You eat mackerel
to look at the bones?

161
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,339
Come on, finish up.
We're going for coffee.

162
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,520
Jiro sure is working hard.

163
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,355
Fish bones.

164
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,066
Is Mr. Horikoshi back from lunch?

165
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,234
Jiro!

166
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,653
Honjo, listen to this.

167
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:42,032
The NACA has a standard
curve just like this bone.

168
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,867
Do Americans eat mackerel too?

169
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,161
Jiro, package for you.

170
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:50,999
A lady brought this for you, sir.

171
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,419
You were out,
so she left it with me.

172
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,046
I see. Thank you.

173
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,217
Present from your sweetheart?

174
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,220
Got a smoke? Gimme one.

175
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,655
- Jiro!
- Let him go.

176
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,474
- Hello, Mr. Horikoshi.
- Back from school.

177
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:52,769
Your guest is waiting.
A young lady.

178
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,605
Oh, right.

179
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,657
Honestly, where were you?

180
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,160
Kayo, I'm sorry.

181
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,412
I completely forgot.

182
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,788
Really!

183
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,500
- Where's Mother?
- At Uncle's.

184
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,169
- Is she staying there?
- Just for one night.

185
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:21,924
You've grown, Kayo.
And gotten very pretty, too.

186
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:26,428
You're so mean.
You never ever come home.

187
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,768
Oh, it's almost sunset already.

188
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:37,314
I'll tell them I kept you.
Let's take the penny steamer.

189
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,027
She must really like you.

190
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,821
Come on, it's been two years.

191
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,658
Didn't you try to see her again?

192
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,369
Of course.
I went back once.

193
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,175
The fire stopped at her street.

194
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,760
See? There's the dock.

195
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,191
Are you cold?

196
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:25,404
I'm fine. I never dreamed
Tokyo would recover so quickly.

197
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,369
Can I stay with you, Jiro?

198
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,747
Father won't let me
live here by myself.

199
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,751
I'll probably be in Nagoya
by the time you come.

200
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,920
- With an airplane company?
- Yes.

201
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,922
Men have it so good.

202
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,676
I want to study medicine in Tokyo.

203
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,179
A doctor? I think
you might be a good one.

204
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,181
I think so too.

205
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:56,059
I'll talk to Father
next time I'm home.

206
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,562
Thanks. I'm counting on you.

207
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,962
Jiro!

208
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,633
There you are.

209
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,176
- You made it.
- Finally.

210
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,845
- We're on our way.
- Yes, we are.

211
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,492
They must've been
heading for the city.

212
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,160
There were hundreds of them.

213
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,287
There's no work in the countryside.

214
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:47,045
Another bank failure.
Which one is it this time?

215
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,678
- Are those the customers?
- Looks like it.

216
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,180
There were rumors.

217
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:02,185
The economy's in the tank.
So is our new employer.

218
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:18,994
MITSUBISHI INTERNAL
COMBUSTION ENGINE CO.

219
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,666
We've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?

220
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,502
I was told to come
anytime in April.

221
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,380
Then you should've come in March!

222
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,341
I've got an assignment for you.

223
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,387
It's the design for the
wing strut fitting.

224
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,891
I need it right away.
We're behind schedule already.

225
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,063
In here.

226
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,735
The data's ready.
This way.

227
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,411
This is your desk.

228
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,915
It's imported,
but no one likes it.

229
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,292
Data here, hat goes there.

230
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,879
Listen up! The Falcon Project
has a new engineer.

231
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,883
He's the genius we've all
been hearing about.

232
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,218
Introduce yourself.

233
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,261
Jiro Horikoshi.

234
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,430
Now get to work.

235
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,487
Jiro, come on.

236
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,365
It's lunchtime. Let's go.

237
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,121
- The assembly plant?
- Yes, I'd like to take a look.

238
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:13,877
Asking a green engineer to design
that fitting is practically hazing.

239
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,253
Two.

240
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:19,049
Excuse me.
Could we ask a favor?

241
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,718
Look, it's really coming along.

242
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,930
Sorry to bother you on your break.

243
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:29,059
Not at all. You young engineers
should visit us more often.

244
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,687
Honjo, the strut's
already installed.

245
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,189
I knew it.

246
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:38,234
Kurokawa's just hazing you.
Is his fitting better than yours?

247
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,946
Mr. Kurokawa's always hard
on new employees.

248
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,282
Honjo, get up here
and take a look.

249
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,409
I need your opinion.

250
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,709
- What do you think?
- Looks strong enough.

251
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:58,088
This is no good.
It's just like my design.

252
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,965
Then it must be bad.

253
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,300
Foreman, lunch break's over.

254
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,927
Quiet.

255
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:07,263
Fascinating! Aircraft
are fascinating!

256
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,474
Maybe they are, but we're late.

257
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,985
I'm Hattori.

258
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,157
Mr. Hattori is our chief engineer.

259
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,993
Is this his first assignment?

260
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,495
The strut fitting for the Falcon.

261
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,665
That's no fitting.
Explain yourself, young man.

262
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,919
Yes sir. This leaf spring
will absorb stress from the wing.

263
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,006
The wire expands
and contracts automatically.

264
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:45,343
It runs through the strut
to an anchor on the fuselage.

265
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,180
But we'd have to
redesign the wing!

266
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:52,183
You're right. I haven't
done the calculations yet.

267
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:56,354
You're wasting your time.
Where's the assignment I gave you?

268
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,689
It's finished.

269
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,197
That looks like
a very clean design to me.

270
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,783
It's perfect.

271
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,162
Submit your work
as soon as you finish!

272
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,209
- I'm heading out.
- Me too.

273
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:21,046
What about Kurokawa's homework?

274
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,380
Just finishing up.

275
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,553
Oxen!

276
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,972
They haul prototypes
to the airfield.

277
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:35,560
The latest aircraft, hauled by oxen.
That's how backward we are.

278
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,395
But they're wonderful creatures.

279
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,003
Here she comes.

280
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,131
Get ready!

281
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,802
Approaching the mark.

282
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,311
Damn it!

283
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,658
- Did you get it?
- 13.3 seconds. 145 knots.

284
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,327
Too slow.
We need ten more knots.

285
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,664
She's too low.
The engine's not performing.

286
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,667
Kurokawa!

287
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,503
Representatives from the Army.

288
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,213
An audacious design.

289
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,176
- Another coup for Mitsubishi.
- Your Falcon is quite impressive.

290
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,030
Power dive.
She's trying to break 200.

291
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,056
- Parachute's open.
- Go get him!

292
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:38,243
Mr. Kurokawa, we'll investigate
the cause when the weather clears.

293
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,411
- What about the pilot?
- He's okay.

294
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,746
That's good.

295
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:46,334
Mr. Kurokawa, let's go.
We'll build Falcon Two.

296
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,463
Do you think the strut
fitting failed?

297
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:55,760
No. I think the problem
is deeper and more complicated.

298
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,763
I'll never forget what I saw today.

299
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:02,267
It's like an endless road is
opening up before my eyes.

300
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,770
There won't be a Falcon Two.

301
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,482
The Army has decided
to go with a competing design.

302
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,487
Today was our last chance
to change their minds.

303
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:19,117
We're going to build a bomber
with help from Junkers.

304
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:21,452
No more fighters for now.

305
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:27,458
This is your chance to see Germany.
I've already approved it.

306
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,538
- Still open?
- Ah, welcome back.

307
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,999
You're later than usual.

308
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,002
- Two slices of the usual.
- Coming up.

309
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,844
There you are.

310
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,013
Isn't anyone looking after them?

311
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:27,018
Their parents work late.
They wait there every night.

312
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,854
I feel bad closing the place up.

313
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,689
I see. Well, thanks.

314
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,191
Come again.

315
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,701
You must be hungry.
Here's something to eat.

316
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,704
It's sponge cake.
I just bought it.

317
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,718
Go ahead, take it.

318
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,553
Come on!

319
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,071
You here, Jiro?

320
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:26,077
Too bad about the Falcon.
I heard they axed it.

321
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:31,082
Sponge cake? You have
some strange eating habits.

322
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,428
What did you expect?

323
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:47,849
Did you think she was going to
smile and say thank you?

324
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,434
Of course not.

325
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,104
Well, maybe I did.

326
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,776
There are dozens of hungry kids
right here in this neighborhood.

327
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:04,991
The cost of one fitting would feed
that kid's family for a month.

328
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,119
Why is Japan so poor?

329
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:13,791
Jiro, do you know what we're paying
the Germans for their technology?

330
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:18,838
Enough to feed every kid in Japan,
with sponge cake for dessert.

331
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:22,967
Still, I plan to make the most
of this opportunity.

332
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,802
They're sending you too?

333
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,137
They told me today.

334
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,139
Really? That's great news.

335
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,267
Poor countries want airplanes.

336
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,812
So they pay us a lot
to design them. It's ironic.

337
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:39,317
I'm leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
Getting married.

338
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,776
Married?

339
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:45,323
To work hard at the office,
you need a family at home.

340
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,158
More irony.

341
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:27,698
Tight-fisted Germans.
They're hardly showing us anything.

342
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,700
I don't see any oxen.

343
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,036
The airstrip's next to the plant.

344
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,038
Everything's so big.

345
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,480
It's the G-38.
Is this what we're buying?

346
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,900
For conversion to a bomber.
It's top secret.

347
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,237
Who's the Army planning
to bomb with this thing?

348
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,906
America, probably.
Not that they could.

349
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,578
Still, it's quite something.

350
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:14,954
Amazing.

351
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:19,458
Passengers can sit in the wings.
This would be wasted as a bomber.

352
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:24,589
Who cares? We need their
all-metal airframe technology.

353
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,262
You're kidding.
We can't go inside?

354
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,292
Beautiful.

355
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,343
Stop it.
Take your hands off him.

356
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,970
Is this how Germans
treat their guests?

357
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:17,308
You Japanese copy everything.
This technology belongs to Germany.

358
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:21,145
Oh, come on. Japan has
lots of planes like this.

359
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,772
Honjo, let it go.

360
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:27,151
We have a license
to your technology.

361
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:32,531
We signed an agreement.
We have the right to be here.

362
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:37,495
Your bosses never said
we couldn't inspect this airplane.

363
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,332
I'm sure you're only
trying to do your job...

364
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,671
but we won't tolerate this treatment.
The agreement is between equals.

365
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:51,008
Our orders were not to let
you Japanese wander around.

366
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,028
That's Dr. Junkers.

367
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:13,030
What an engineer.

368
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,369
You can go inside.
Dr. Junkers has agreed.

369
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,551
I'm surprised we got
a demonstration.

370
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,720
There's more vibration
than I expected.

371
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,973
Our bosses are getting giddy.

372
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,393
Let the Army officers sit here.

373
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,399
Just a moment.

374
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,402
This is truly a
stupendous aircraft.

375
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,740
Look, a corridor through the wing.

376
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,243
This is amazing.

377
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,247
It's like being
inside a power plant.

378
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:11,422
Guten tag.
Dr. Junkers gave us permission.

379
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,716
Please show us your work station.

380
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,718
This is the flight
engineer's station.

381
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,762
This aircraft is marvelous.

382
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,600
Japanese, do not go further.

383
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,437
Of course, my friend.

384
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,607
- This is incredible.
- Yes, it's fantastic.

385
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,943
A triumph of
German industrial technology.

386
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:08,479
Dr. Junkers is my hero,
but his company is sneaky.

387
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,316
Got a cigarette, Jiro?

388
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,819
Jiro!

389
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,155
A cigarette.

390
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,491
No. We're out.

391
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:40,511
It looks cold outside,
but this room is cozy.

392
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,181
I thought Germans used fireplaces.

393
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:49,353
Junkers makes radiators too.
This almost looks like that plane.

394
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,521
It's beautiful.

395
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:54,859
And our technology is primitive.
That's what you mean, right?

396
00:50:55,427 --> 00:51:00,364
You think we'll never figure out
all-metal construction on our own?

397
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:04,702
We can't learn anything from this.

398
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,038
These are just pretty equations.

399
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,709
"This technology
belongs to Germany."

400
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,713
Maybe we don't even
need their technology.

401
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,549
Wood and canvas
could be as good as metal.

402
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:23,053
Then we'll never make it.
We're already 20 years behind.

403
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,393
Let's take a walk.

404
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,563
My brain is boiling.

405
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:45,034
We're Achilles, chasing a tortoise
with a twenty-year lead.

406
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:50,372
If we close the gap
in five years...

407
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:53,042
he'll be five more years
down the road.

408
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,378
We'll always be chasing him.

409
00:51:56,404 --> 00:52:01,342
Someday we'll overtake him
and move ahead.

410
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:05,220
I wonder if we
can be the tortoise.

411
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,062
What?

412
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,317
Listen to that.

413
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:27,242
Schubert's "Winter Journey".
It's perfect for us.

414
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,936
- What was that about?
- We saw him in the hangar.

415
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,496
Jiro?

416
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,500
I'm done. Go have a bath.

417
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,673
Dead to the world...

418
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:09,178
with a face like he's carrying
the future of Japanese aviation.

419
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,683
There's a telegram
from headquarters.

420
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,560
- Come in.
- Not necessary.

421
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:20,856
Some of us are returning immediately.
You're staying behind.

422
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,359
Jiro will continue west
and return to Japan.

423
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,362
- West?
- They want him to see the world.

424
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,031
All by himself?

425
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,892
Mr. Caproni.

426
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,186
Is the wind still rising?

427
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,772
Yes, it is.

428
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:06,568
Then I invite you to join me
on my final flight. Come.

429
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,570
You're retiring?

430
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,907
It's a big jump.

431
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,412
Jump!

432
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,508
Hurry. We're taking off.

433
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:33,512
There's a hatch under the fuselage.

434
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,430
Hurry!

435
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,807
Let me through.

436
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,100
Up here!

437
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,111
- Full power!
- Fly! Fly!

438
00:55:56,311 --> 00:56:01,165
My workmen's families and relatives.
Practically the whole village.

439
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,792
We're taking a private jaunt...

440
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:07,629
before we deliver this bomber
to the Air Force.

441
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,138
- What do you think?
- It's incredible.

442
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,641
It's like a building
out of ancient Rome.

443
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:23,312
This plane is too large
to be used for war...

444
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,856
but the Air Force
likes everything big.

445
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,817
Japan is poor and backward.

446
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,821
We could never build
something like this.

447
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,949
The important thing
for an engineer is inspiration.

448
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:40,704
Inspiration unlocks the future.
Technology will catch up.

449
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,167
My wife and family.

450
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:50,172
We Italians are also poor.
Too many mouths to feed.

451
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,514
Hey, settle down.
The bottom will fall out.

452
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,516
Come.

453
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:10,359
Be careful. This may be a dream,
but you can still lose your head.

454
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:24,706
Which would you choose, a world
with pyramids or one without them?

455
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,250
Pyramids?

456
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:31,213
Humanity dreams of flight,
but the dream is cursed.

457
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:36,051
Aircraft are destined to become tools
for slaughter and destruction.

458
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,219
I know.

459
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:41,723
But still, I chose a world
with pyramids in it.

460
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,726
Which world will you choose?

461
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:48,230
I want to create
beautiful airplanes.

462
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,731
Like that?

463
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,416
Very graceful.

464
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:11,878
I have a long way to go.
I don't even have the engine yet.

465
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:25,267
Bravo! A beautiful dream.

466
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:36,111
I'm retiring.
This is my last design.

467
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,614
Artists are only creative
for ten years.

468
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,784
We engineers are no different.

469
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:48,123
Live your ten years to the full.

470
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,808
Jiro, we need to talk.

471
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,977
- I've got a meeting.
- Cancel it.

472
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,830
- This is a tall order.
- They're always tall.

473
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:31,500
How long have you
been with us, Jiro?

474
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:34,002
Jiro?

475
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,505
- How long?
- Five years.

476
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:40,342
You should be ready, then.
We want you to lead the project.

477
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:44,012
It's the Navy's design competition
for 1932. A carrier-based fighter.

478
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,514
A plum assignment.

479
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,060
Well, Jiro?

480
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,864
What do you think?

481
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,574
Leave it to me.

482
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,034
Good.

483
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,203
I'd like Honjo on the team.

484
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,579
Bad idea.

485
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:13,375
You'd end up competing.
Friendship's more important.

486
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,877
Relax and finish your coffee.

487
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,380
Check, please.

488
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,550
We've got other plans for Honjo.

489
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,098
Damn these Japanese engines!

490
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,944
And damn this short flight deck.

491
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,284
Fresh uniforms!

492
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,328
Oh, thanks.

493
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,966
Thanks for your help.

494
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,301
Those jerseys suit you.

495
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,163
Close the flight deck!

496
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,384
Stop!

497
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:12,947
We did it!

498
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,783
She's airborne!

499
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:22,016
Father!

500
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:11,441
Bravo! Nice catch.

501
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:18,239
That was kind of you.
Are you all right?

502
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:19,908
I'm fine. Here you are.

503
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:23,077
Thank you.
It belongs to the hotel.

504
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,579
Well, goodbye.

505
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:41,095
Father, I'm afraid
I was rude to that man.

506
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:43,431
Don't worry.
He's staying at our hotel.

507
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:46,643
You'll have a chance
to say thank you.

508
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,934
What is it?

509
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:36,938
Nothing. Just that man
who caught the parasol.

510
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:40,108
He seems to be here by himself.

511
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,389
I'm sorry. I'd better go.

512
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:59,187
No, please stay.
I was giving thanks to the spring.

513
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:03,524
I asked it
to bring you here, to me.

514
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:11,574
You haven't changed at all.
You're just like you were then.

515
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:16,079
We were so grateful
for your help after the earthquake.

516
01:11:16,271 --> 01:11:19,415
I wanted to see you
again and thank you.

517
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,584
Oh, now I remember.

518
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,587
My name is Nahoko Satomi.

519
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:27,423
Jiro Horikoshi.

520
01:11:49,304 --> 01:11:50,947
Are you all right?

521
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,448
I'm fine.

522
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:58,788
Kinu got married two days after
she dropped off your shirt.

523
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,542
She cried for joy
when we found you.

524
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:06,129
You were our knight
in shining armor.

525
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,296
Your knight?

526
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:10,800
You were like a knight on a
white horse that day.

527
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,636
This umbrella sure does leak.

528
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,304
It's all right.

529
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,306
I've got to tell Kinu.

530
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:20,810
She just had her second child.

531
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,937
It's such a cute baby.

532
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,651
Your painting is all wet.

533
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:31,821
Yes. I'll keep it this way
in honor of today.

534
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,157
Look, it's clearing up.

535
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:42,832
The rain stopped here.

536
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,669
Oh, look at that.

537
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,180
I'd almost forgotten
what rainbows look like.

538
01:12:57,372 --> 01:12:59,682
Life is wonderful, isn't it?

539
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,353
We'd better go.
Father's probably worried sick.

540
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,193
There's my father.

541
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:12,695
Father!

542
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:16,199
Come, I'll introduce you.

543
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,369
You're soaking wet.

544
01:13:20,395 --> 01:13:25,541
Don't worry, Father. I'm fine.
Mr. Horikoshi saved me again.

545
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,043
Jiro Horikoshi.

546
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:31,672
Satomi. I'm afraid my daughter has
caused you trouble again.

547
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,928
May I sit here?

548
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:21,931
Certainly.

549
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,035
German tobacco. Last one. Too bad.

550
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:48,291
I know how you feel.
The same thing happened to me.

551
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:53,045
You visit Germany, yes? To Dessau.

552
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,549
You must be Sherlock Holmes.

553
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,968
You are an engineer.

554
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:03,306
You read German magazines.
Magazines about airplanes.

555
01:15:03,498 --> 01:15:07,310
All Japanese engineers
visit Dessau.

556
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:11,314
You're exactly right.

557
01:15:12,507 --> 01:15:16,610
- Dr. Junkers is in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

558
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,325
He fights the government.
He will blow up.

559
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,827
Mr. Hitler's government?

560
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:28,331
The Nazis are a gang of hoodlums.

561
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:31,167
This is a good place.

562
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:35,838
No mosquitoes.
Not hot. Good watercress.

563
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:38,799
A good place to forget bad things.

564
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:41,344
Cigarette? I'm afraid
they're Japanese.

565
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,678
Thank you.

566
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:52,355
It is a nice night.
Hier ist der Zauberberg.

567
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,565
"The Magic Mountain"
by Thomas Mann?

568
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,360
A good place for forgetting.

569
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,696
Make a war in China. Forget it.

570
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:03,949
Make a puppet state
in Manchuria. Forget it.

571
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,370
Quit the League of Nations.
Forget it.

572
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:10,206
Make the world your enemy.
Forget it.

573
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,875
Japan will blow up.

574
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,878
Germany will blow up too.

575
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:20,549
- Will Germany go to war again?
- Yes. They must be stopped.

576
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,762
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting so long.

577
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,390
Nahoko has a fever.

578
01:16:27,582 --> 01:16:30,559
I'm afraid we'll have to
cancel our dinner plans.

579
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:34,563
I'm sorry. Please tell her
I hope she feels better.

580
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,900
I must go.
The doctor will be here soon.

581
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,519
"Who has seen the wind?"

582
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,688
"Neither I nor you."

583
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:44,860
"But when the leaves hang trembling,
the wind is passing through."

584
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:52,701
Let the wind carry...

585
01:18:53,728 --> 01:18:55,913
these wings to you.

586
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,450
Jiro?

587
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,910
Nahoko!

588
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:56,765
Be careful!

589
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:57,803
Nice catch.

590
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:14,630
Bravo!

591
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,466
Is the young lady feeling better?

592
01:23:17,992 --> 01:23:19,968
Yes, she's much better.

593
01:23:19,994 --> 01:23:21,470
Congratulations.

594
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:25,307
This is the magic mountain.
It cures everyone.

595
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,476
I think you're right.

596
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:32,314
At first, this young
man was very gloomy.

597
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,483
Now he is very happy.

598
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:36,693
He has fallen in love.

599
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:38,654
That's true.

600
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,658
Summer love is soon forgotten.

601
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:46,495
You will go down the mountain.
You will forget what happened here.

602
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:48,664
Not me.

603
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:53,502
This person you're talking about
wouldn't be my daughter, would it?

604
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,838
Yes, it's Nahoko.

605
01:23:57,532 --> 01:24:00,217
Please give us your permission.

606
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:02,845
But...

607
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,179
Father!

608
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,267
I would like to accept.

609
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,519
What a beauty.

610
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:16,859
But first, there's something
I have to tell you.

611
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:17,985
Yes?

612
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:22,197
Two years ago, my mother
died of tuberculosis.

613
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:25,200
I contracted it too.

614
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:29,955
I've loved you since that
day you rescued my hat.

615
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:34,376
I've loved you since the
wind brought you to me.

616
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:36,879
Please marry me.

617
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:38,005
I will.

618
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:42,217
But I want to get well first.
Can you wait for me?

619
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:45,220
Even if it takes a hundred years.

620
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,389
Congratulations.

621
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:52,144
He is a nice young man.
Your daughter is wonderful.

622
01:24:53,087 --> 01:24:56,106
This is a good summer.

623
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:21,423
- Jiro, over here!
- Honjo!

624
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,759
- When did you get back?
- Two days ago.

625
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,427
Hot, isn't it?

626
01:25:28,122 --> 01:25:30,098
Come take a look.

627
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,271
She's beautiful.

628
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,440
Good clean lines.

629
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:45,948
It's a radical design.
They gave me free rein.

630
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,284
But we won't know until she flies.

631
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:53,288
She'll fly.
I feel the wind rising.

632
01:26:14,168 --> 01:26:18,313
You're the Japanese Achilles.
You've closed the gap.

633
01:26:19,173 --> 01:26:21,149
My plane was just a tin duckling.

634
01:26:21,175 --> 01:26:22,985
I have an idea for you.

635
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,654
I haven't tried it yet.

636
01:26:28,182 --> 01:26:30,993
Use flathead screws
on the access hatches.

637
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,828
They'll reduce drag.

638
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:37,499
Maintenance will be easy
with a hinge on one side.

639
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:45,507
A spring about this stiff
should be fine.

640
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:49,428
That's a great idea,
like Columbus and his egg.

641
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:50,679
You should use it.

642
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,348
Thanks, but not this time.

643
01:26:55,209 --> 01:26:56,810
I'll keep the plans.

644
01:26:56,878 --> 01:27:00,188
After you use it, I'll use it too.

645
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:02,357
Okay.

646
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:04,985
Hurry up, I'll be waiting.

647
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:07,863
Jiro! Are you here?

648
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:10,866
Jiro, it's Mr. Kurokawa.

649
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:12,200
It's an emergency.

650
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:13,535
See you.

651
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:15,537
Visit the house next time.

652
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,372
Jiro, you pedal.

653
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:25,047
The Special Police
are looking for you.

654
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,383
The thought crime boys.

655
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,218
Why me?

656
01:27:30,244 --> 01:27:32,554
I told them you were
away on business.

657
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:46,735
Pretending to leave?
We won't fall for that.

658
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:49,571
You'd better work here.
We'll bring your things.

659
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:52,574
What's going on?
Why are they after me?

660
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:58,080
They arrested some of my friends.
None of them understood why.

661
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,582
Come in.

662
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:02,084
Here's your stuff.

663
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,921
Sorry for the bother.

664
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,589
Need anything else?

665
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:10,592
- Just leave it and go.
- Jiro, it's here!

666
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,594
The prototype flange.

667
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:24,439
It looks great.

668
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,441
Wish we'd had it last year.

669
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,235
Jiro, what do you think?

670
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:32,614
Our next plane will be
a full-grown duck, not a duckling.

671
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,951
A full metal duck.

672
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:37,702
How about it, Mr. Kurokawa?

673
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:42,290
Extruded aluminum alloy.
Very light. What a luxury.

674
01:28:42,316 --> 01:28:44,042
All right, back to work.

675
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:58,640
- The coast looks clear.
- Okay, Jiro.

676
01:29:00,376 --> 01:29:03,145
Better lie low for a few days.

677
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,313
We'll smooth things over.

678
01:29:05,381 --> 01:29:07,149
I'll put you up.

679
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:10,277
Let me stop by my apartment.
I'm expecting a letter.

680
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:12,654
Is it something sensitive?

681
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,322
Yes, very sensitive.

682
01:29:14,557 --> 01:29:16,658
The police will be
opening your mail.

683
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:18,243
It's from my fiancée.

684
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:21,997
Such things shouldn't happen
in a modern country.

685
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:25,500
You're engaged?

686
01:29:26,235 --> 01:29:28,503
- Jiro's human after all.
- Splendid.

687
01:29:28,571 --> 01:29:30,839
You think Japan's a modern country?

688
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:32,382
It's not funny.

689
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:36,011
Of course it's not funny.
The police are waiting for you.

690
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:38,388
Let them read your love letters.

691
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:42,017
The Navy's next design
competition is in your hands.

692
01:29:42,251 --> 01:29:47,022
The company will protect you.
That is, as long as you're useful.

693
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:49,524
Just keep your mind on work.

694
01:29:50,593 --> 01:29:54,196
I miss you terribly.
And "Mr. Castorp" left so suddenly.

695
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:57,699
Why are they looking for him?

696
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:15,133
I pray that he managed to
leave Japan safely.

697
01:30:32,468 --> 01:30:34,236
Jiro, telephone for you.

698
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:35,904
Coming.

699
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,740
- The telephone is there.
- Thank you.

700
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:44,579
- Hello?
- Jiro? You have a telegram.

701
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:45,705
What?

702
01:30:45,731 --> 01:30:50,252
Your landlord brought it.
It came two days ago.

703
01:30:50,653 --> 01:30:51,920
Please read it.

704
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:53,255
Are you sure?

705
01:30:55,324 --> 01:31:00,011
"Nahoko... has had
a lung... hemorrhage."

706
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:02,597
"Please come at once.
Satomi"

707
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:11,439
Hello? Are you there?

708
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:14,276
I understand. Thank you.

709
01:31:14,343 --> 01:31:15,944
Wait, hold on!

710
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:19,781
What is it?

711
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:24,035
What's the fastest way
to get to Tokyo?

712
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,620
To Tokyo?

713
01:31:25,688 --> 01:31:28,290
I have to be there
as soon as possible.

714
01:31:28,357 --> 01:31:30,125
Let me see.

715
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:34,462
If you take the noon bus,
you can catch the express.

716
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:37,632
I'll send someone
to hold the bus for you.

717
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:39,301
Jiya!

718
01:33:26,809 --> 01:33:27,909
Darling!

719
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:40,088
I wish I could've come sooner.

720
01:33:45,661 --> 01:33:47,262
You'll catch it.

721
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:48,930
You're beautiful.

722
01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:51,099
I love you.

723
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:55,270
Jiro? Through the garden?

724
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:06,281
Come in.

725
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:10,952
Father, Jiro came to see me.

726
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:13,621
But he has to leave right away.

727
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:18,293
- Next time I'll use the front door.
- Use the garden, it's more fun.

728
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:20,295
All right, I will.

729
01:34:20,529 --> 01:34:22,630
Take care, darling.

730
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:24,299
You too.

731
01:34:25,701 --> 01:34:27,302
Goodbye.

732
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,636
I'll see you out.

733
01:34:33,876 --> 01:34:36,978
The last train?
You'd better hurry.

734
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:42,650
Is it that serious?
I wish I could look after her.

735
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:46,154
The way to do that is
to focus on your work.

736
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:47,989
Now you'd better go.

737
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:56,998
He's gone.

738
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,001
Are you crying, dear?

739
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:07,342
I'm going to the sanatorium
the doctor recommended.

740
01:35:07,576 --> 01:35:11,012
But it's so lonely.
You'll be all by yourself.

741
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:13,515
I want to get better.

742
01:35:13,707 --> 01:35:15,850
I want a life with Jiro.

743
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:24,526
You're just in time.
The board is waiting.

744
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:33,284
So, are you ready?

745
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:35,787
I'll do my best.

746
01:35:35,938 --> 01:35:38,706
Now the Navy.
They're the client.

747
01:35:49,618 --> 01:35:51,302
I'll do my best.

748
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:54,055
- You weren't even listening.
- Right.

749
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:58,726
So I gave up on that idea.

750
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:04,899
- Everyone's here rather late.
- Jiro's holding a design seminar.

751
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:10,405
The next design uses
all the latest technology.

752
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:13,575
- Take a look.
- Retractable undercarriage!

753
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:16,244
We'll need it for 270 knots.

754
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:19,706
270 knots?
That's 500 kilometers an hour!

755
01:36:19,982 --> 01:36:22,458
I thought the Navy
requested 220 knots.

756
01:36:22,985 --> 01:36:25,420
We're designing for the future.

757
01:36:25,988 --> 01:36:28,590
Wing loading is 120 kilos
per square meter.

758
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:33,261
We'll minimize drag
and push the limits of technology.

759
01:36:33,829 --> 01:36:36,764
She'll have split flaps
and leading edge slats.

760
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:55,116
We can do it!

761
01:36:55,434 --> 01:36:57,493
When do we start?

762
01:36:58,187 --> 01:37:00,496
But then weight becomes a problem.

763
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:06,628
If we leave out the guns,
we should be okay.

764
01:37:12,868 --> 01:37:16,137
I decided to set
this idea aside for now.

765
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:19,307
This is delightful.
Lucid and logical.

766
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:20,892
Almost had it.

767
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:23,436
Our engines are underpowered.

768
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:26,648
To compensate, we need
a light, strong structure.

769
01:37:26,715 --> 01:37:30,985
We'll cut excess weight and
minimize drag with a smooth skin.

770
01:37:31,053 --> 01:37:33,821
We're going to build
an all-metal fighter...

771
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:36,157
like nothing the world's ever seen.

772
01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:38,326
I have a question!

773
01:37:38,561 --> 01:37:40,161
Mr. Hirayama, please.

774
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:44,332
Mr. Hirayama is our
production engineer.

775
01:37:44,733 --> 01:37:45,625
Thank you.

776
01:37:47,861 --> 01:37:50,838
He's going to tell us
about the new rivets.

777
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:57,136
It's technically possible to build
strong structures with flush rivets.

778
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:58,680
What's he talking about?

779
01:37:59,081 --> 01:38:00,640
A way to cut drag.

780
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:06,229
We're going to skin the whole
aircraft with flush rivets.

781
01:38:06,255 --> 01:38:08,690
- Question!
- I have a question!

782
01:38:11,093 --> 01:38:13,528
I must say, that was interesting.

783
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:15,196
It was inspiring.

784
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:37,552
Today's letter, Miss Satomi.

785
01:38:37,786 --> 01:38:39,554
Thank you.

786
01:39:59,034 --> 01:40:00,635
Phone call, Chief.

787
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:03,930
- I'll call back.
- I think it's an emergency.

788
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:07,308
Hello? Mr. Satomi?

789
01:40:07,876 --> 01:40:09,477
What?!

790
01:41:22,284 --> 01:41:24,385
Jiro! Jiro!

791
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:28,222
Thank goodness.
I worried I wouldn't find you.

792
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:32,727
I'm here now. Can you walk?

793
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:35,062
Let's go.

794
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:45,406
I just had to see you.
I should go right back.

795
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:46,407
Don't go.

796
01:41:50,145 --> 01:41:51,913
We should be together.

797
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:07,261
- What a charming companion.
- My name is Nahoko.

798
01:42:07,329 --> 01:42:10,097
- So you're Nahoko.
- Jiro, is that you?

799
01:42:10,165 --> 01:42:12,433
We've come to you with a request.

800
01:42:13,335 --> 01:42:15,436
Why not, dear? It'll be fine.

801
01:42:15,504 --> 01:42:17,271
We've got plenty of room...

802
01:42:17,339 --> 01:42:22,610
but I can hardly approve of an
unmarried couple living together.

803
01:42:23,178 --> 01:42:24,779
We'll get married right away.

804
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:27,865
Mr. Kurokawa, Mrs. Kurokawa,
please be our witnesses.

805
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:29,450
Here? Tonight?

806
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:31,619
It sounds lovely, dear.

807
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:35,122
Nahoko was very brave
to leave the sanatorium.

808
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:39,627
My father's given his permission.
I've already told the doctor.

809
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:41,128
Please help us.

810
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:46,801
The bride and I have
preparations to make.

811
01:42:47,202 --> 01:42:48,803
Come with me, Nahoko.

812
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,478
Don't worry, he's always like that.

813
01:43:01,383 --> 01:43:06,320
If you care about her,
you'll send her back immediately.

814
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:11,659
I can't do that.
I'd have to give up my work.

815
01:43:11,894 --> 01:43:15,162
Is that your heart
or your ego talking?

816
01:43:16,064 --> 01:43:19,417
We don't have much time.
We've made our decision.

817
01:43:20,569 --> 01:43:21,836
I see.

818
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:25,172
All right.
We'll have a real ceremony!

819
01:43:49,848 --> 01:43:51,198
Here they come.

820
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:53,701
She's coming!

821
01:44:12,955 --> 01:44:18,225
Hear me! This lovely maiden has
traveled far to join her beloved.

822
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:23,898
She's given up everything in the
world for him. What say you?

823
01:44:24,299 --> 01:44:27,401
Hear me! This man is
an insensitive simpleton...

824
01:44:27,469 --> 01:44:29,737
without a home of his own.

825
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:33,240
If that's... uh, okay with you,
please come in.

826
01:44:33,308 --> 01:44:36,911
Then they shall exchange
the marriage vows.

827
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:00,935
You look beautiful.

828
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:39,640
Mr. and Mrs. Kurokawa.

829
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:44,979
No words can express
our gratitude for your kindness.

830
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:47,648
We will never forget
our debt to you.

831
01:45:50,385 --> 01:45:55,489
Come now, we're delighted that Jiro's
found such a wonderful partner.

832
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:56,657
Aren't we, dear?

833
01:45:56,725 --> 01:46:00,995
Of course. This is wonderful.
You're both very courageous.

834
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:18,179
You must be tired.

835
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:22,683
I feel like I'm dreaming.
The room is spinning.

836
01:46:22,918 --> 01:46:25,144
Better get some rest.

837
01:46:26,254 --> 01:46:27,271
Come here.

838
01:46:27,589 --> 01:46:29,023
But your condition...

839
01:46:31,093 --> 01:46:32,359
Come.

840
01:47:14,052 --> 01:47:16,737
Do you always get home this late?

841
01:47:16,763 --> 01:47:18,447
Kayo, I completely forgot.

842
01:47:18,723 --> 01:47:20,699
You're so insensitive.

843
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:25,037
Congratulations on
becoming a doctor.

844
01:47:25,063 --> 01:47:28,040
Congratulations on your marriage.

845
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:31,877
I came on behalf of the family
to thank the Kurokawas.

846
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:33,379
Are they still up?

847
01:47:33,488 --> 01:47:35,047
They've gone to bed.

848
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,383
- Did you meet Nahoko?
- Yes.

849
01:47:41,246 --> 01:47:46,225
What are you going to do?
She's alone in that room all day.

850
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:50,187
Her condition is
much worse than you think.

851
01:47:50,255 --> 01:47:53,232
I'm an intern.
I know something about this.

852
01:47:53,758 --> 01:47:59,071
Did you notice she uses rouge
every morning so you won't worry?

853
01:48:00,432 --> 01:48:04,076
I really like Nahoko.
She's such a good person.

854
01:48:04,102 --> 01:48:06,370
How can you do this to her?

855
01:48:10,817 --> 01:48:13,252
Does she really have to stay here?

856
01:48:13,278 --> 01:48:14,420
Yes.

857
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:19,758
Each day is very
precious to us now.

858
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:25,264
Get some rest.
I'm glad you came to visit.

859
01:48:40,472 --> 01:48:41,780
I'm home.

860
01:48:41,806 --> 01:48:44,116
- I was waiting.
- You should sleep.

861
01:48:50,315 --> 01:48:53,625
- Should you be up?
- Kayo came today.

862
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:56,628
We're already best friends.

863
01:48:57,656 --> 01:49:01,633
She's like the sun,
with such a bright future.

864
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:06,138
She said next time,
she'll come as my doctor.

865
01:49:07,499 --> 01:49:12,311
And your mother made me
a chemise and a nightgown.

866
01:49:12,671 --> 01:49:14,688
Look, they're so warm.

867
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:16,899
Too bright?

868
01:49:17,676 --> 01:49:18,901
It's all right.

869
01:49:21,012 --> 01:49:23,489
I have to finish
the design by tomorrow.

870
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:24,990
For your mackerel bones?

871
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:26,825
You remembered.

872
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:30,496
I think it could
be a little lighter.

873
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:34,541
Come a little closer.

874
01:49:43,868 --> 01:49:45,511
Give me your hand.

875
01:49:48,707 --> 01:49:53,018
I like to look at you
while you work.

876
01:49:53,545 --> 01:49:58,357
In a one-handed slide rule contest,
I'd win first prize for sure.

877
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:02,528
I think I can make each rib
half an ounce lighter.

878
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:04,530
Really? That's good.

879
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:06,865
Thirty ribs makes about a pound.

880
01:50:07,058 --> 01:50:08,492
That's too much.

881
01:50:08,893 --> 01:50:11,495
Half a pound is enough for two.

882
01:50:11,896 --> 01:50:16,208
I could eat a pound
of mackerel by myself.

883
01:50:21,906 --> 01:50:24,383
I'll keep holding your hand.
You should sleep.

884
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:27,719
- You won't let go?
- No, I won't.

885
01:50:30,081 --> 01:50:33,559
I need a cigarette.
Can I let go for a minute?

886
01:50:33,752 --> 01:50:36,228
No. Smoke it here.

887
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:38,730
- It's not good for you.
- I don't care.

888
01:50:58,109 --> 01:50:59,751
Hey, Honjo.

889
01:50:59,944 --> 01:51:01,420
Can I take a look?

890
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:04,631
- Sure. How's your bomber?
- Coming along fine.

891
01:51:04,783 --> 01:51:08,927
This is avant garde.
You went all the way.

892
01:51:12,123 --> 01:51:14,433
So this is flush riveting.

893
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,269
Feels pretty rough.

894
01:51:18,296 --> 01:51:20,105
We're still learning the technique.

895
01:51:20,298 --> 01:51:25,277
You've left the Germans behind.
I'm still stuck with them.

896
01:51:27,722 --> 01:51:32,075
This design is you,
right down to the mackerel bones.

897
01:51:34,312 --> 01:51:39,625
Jiro, let me use flush rivets too.
And your spring-loaded hatches.

898
01:51:39,651 --> 01:51:41,460
Sure. Why not?

899
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:42,794
A redesign?

900
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:47,132
Yeah, but they're only letting me
modify the fuselage.

901
01:51:47,492 --> 01:51:48,967
And leave the wings alone?

902
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:52,346
That's where the fuel tanks are.
One hit, and boom.

903
01:51:52,831 --> 01:51:56,642
To save weight, we're not even
shielding the fuel tanks.

904
01:51:56,668 --> 01:52:00,771
It's Japan's first advanced bomber.
The Navy's over the moon.

905
01:52:02,674 --> 01:52:06,652
She's got to fly 3,000 kilometers
with a big payload.

906
01:52:07,011 --> 01:52:09,655
More horsepower alone
won't be enough.

907
01:52:22,777 --> 01:52:24,670
Who are they going to fight?

908
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:28,840
China. Russia. Britain.
The Netherlands. America.

909
01:52:28,867 --> 01:52:30,342
Japan will blow up.

910
01:52:31,202 --> 01:52:35,180
We're not arms merchants. We just
want to build good aircraft.

911
01:52:35,206 --> 01:52:36,181
You're right.

912
01:52:36,207 --> 01:52:38,183
See you. Get some sleep.

913
01:52:38,209 --> 01:52:40,227
Sure. You too.

914
01:52:41,379 --> 01:52:42,854
I'm leaving now.

915
01:52:43,047 --> 01:52:44,356
Good night.

916
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:45,899
Night.

917
01:53:11,075 --> 01:53:12,718
Welcome home.

918
01:53:13,077 --> 01:53:16,221
It's finished.
Now we'll see how she flies.

919
01:53:16,414 --> 01:53:19,558
Congratulations.
You worked so hard.

920
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:23,103
She's on her way to the field.

921
01:53:23,254 --> 01:53:25,897
I'll probably spend
a few nights there.

922
01:53:26,758 --> 01:53:28,567
You must be tired.

923
01:53:30,762 --> 01:53:32,362
A little.

924
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:34,573
I'm sure it will fly beautifully.

925
01:53:34,933 --> 01:53:37,367
Yes, she'll fly.

926
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,954
I couldn't have done
it without you.

927
01:53:41,272 --> 01:53:43,415
I love you, Jiro.

928
01:53:44,108 --> 01:53:45,584
Nahoko...

929
01:54:38,663 --> 01:54:39,971
I'm off.

930
01:54:39,998 --> 01:54:41,473
Good luck.

931
01:55:07,859 --> 01:55:09,710
Why, Nahoko. You're up.

932
01:55:10,153 --> 01:55:15,006
I'm feeling much better today.
I'm going for a walk.

933
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:18,009
Just be careful
not to tire yourself.

934
01:55:19,037 --> 01:55:23,348
The room's still a mess.
I'll straighten up when I get back.

935
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:26,017
All right. Enjoy yourself.

936
01:55:26,044 --> 01:55:28,854
Kayo's coming today.
That will be nice.

937
01:55:29,047 --> 01:55:31,022
Yes. I'll be back soon.

938
01:56:12,423 --> 01:56:14,566
Please come in.

939
01:56:20,598 --> 01:56:22,574
Oh, no.

940
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:34,503
Look, she left letters!
One of them's for me.

941
01:56:40,284 --> 01:56:44,596
She's going to the sanatorium!
I'll bring her back.

942
01:56:44,789 --> 01:56:46,264
No! Let her go.

943
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:52,771
We shouldn't do anything
until her train leaves.

944
01:56:54,298 --> 01:56:58,109
She wants him
to remember her as she was.

945
01:57:44,932 --> 01:57:48,785
This is wonderful.
Just think, that's one of ours.

946
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:50,996
How's her speed?

947
01:57:51,189 --> 01:57:54,583
Sorry, the numbers are too high.
We're checking them again.

948
01:57:54,692 --> 01:57:56,001
How fast?

949
01:57:56,027 --> 01:57:59,337
- 240 knots.
- Two forty!

950
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:37,542
- Fantastic!
- What a fighter.

951
01:58:38,736 --> 01:58:40,211
Hey, Jiro.

952
01:58:40,571 --> 01:58:41,880
Jiro!

953
01:58:49,747 --> 01:58:52,724
She flies like a dream.
Thank you.

954
02:00:05,364 --> 02:00:08,842
We meet again, Japanese boy.

955
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:11,302
Mr. Caproni...

956
02:00:14,916 --> 02:00:18,143
This is where we first met.

957
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:20,645
Our kingdom of dreams.

958
02:00:21,088 --> 02:00:22,814
Or the land of the dead.

959
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:25,817
Not quite. In some ways, yes.

960
02:00:26,177 --> 02:00:30,238
Those ten years in the sun,
did you live them to the full?

961
02:00:30,264 --> 02:00:33,158
Yes. Things fell apart
toward the end, though.

962
02:00:33,351 --> 02:00:35,952
That's what it means to lose a war.

963
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:38,663
There's your Zero fighter.

964
02:01:16,018 --> 02:01:18,870
Beautiful. A masterful design.

965
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:21,539
Not a single plane returned.

966
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:24,209
There was nothing to come back to.

967
02:01:24,402 --> 02:01:27,504
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
Cursed dreams...

968
02:01:27,655 --> 02:01:30,090
waiting for the sky
to swallow them up.

969
02:01:31,659 --> 02:01:33,551
Someone is waiting for you.

970
02:01:48,634 --> 02:01:49,734
Nahoko...

971
02:01:49,927 --> 02:01:53,196
She's been waiting
here for a long time.

972
02:01:53,597 --> 02:01:56,074
Darling, you must live.

973
02:02:00,312 --> 02:02:01,579
You must live...

974
02:02:23,794 --> 02:02:25,770
She is gone.

975
02:02:27,131 --> 02:02:29,607
She was beautiful, like the wind.

976
02:02:30,968 --> 02:02:34,779
Thank you.

977
02:02:36,223 --> 02:02:38,449
You must live.

978
02:02:38,642 --> 02:02:43,329
First, shall we drop by my house?
I have some excellent wine.

979

02:03:14,011 --> 02:03:18,990
A white sloping path

982
02:03:20,017 --> 02:03:25,496
Runs up into the sky

983
02:03:25,689 --> 02:03:30,168
A gently swaying, misy haze

984
02:03:30,903 --> 02:03:35,506
Surrounding and holding

985
02:03:35,699 --> 02:03:41,512
Unnoticed by anyone, all alone

986
02:03:42,206 --> 02:03:47,518
Soaring upwards

987
02:03:47,878 --> 02:03:52,690
Not afraid of anything

988
02:03:52,883 --> 02:03:58,321
Dancing up

989
02:03:58,556 --> 02:04:03,868
Longing to be in the sky

990
02:04:04,061 --> 02:04:09,707
Speeding through the sky

991
02:04:10,067 --> 02:04:20,218
A whole life, a vapor trail

992
02:04:21,078 --> 02:04:25,890
Even before dying

993
02:04:26,959 --> 02:04:32,397
From that window, up high

994
02:04:32,590 --> 02:04:37,235
Watching the sky

995
02:04:37,928 --> 02:04:42,407
Now no one understands

996
02:04:42,933 --> 02:04:48,413
No one would understand

997
02:04:49,607 --> 02:04:59,924
All they could think was...
"Too young"

998
02:05:00,451 --> 02:05:05,471
Yet... happy

999
02:05:05,789 --> 02:05:11,269
Longing to be in the sky

1000
02:05:11,295 --> 02:05:17,275
Speeding through the sky

1001
02:05:17,468 --> 02:05:27,452
A whole life, a vapor trail

1002
02:05:28,145 --> 02:05:33,458
Longing to be in the sky

1003
02:05:33,651 --> 02:05:39,130
Speeding through the sky

1004
02:05:39,657 --> 02:05:51,476
A whole life, a vapor trail

1005
