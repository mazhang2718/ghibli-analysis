I caught a soot gremlin, but he got away.

They live in old, empty houses

201

covering everything with dirt.

That's very interesting.

They're nothing to be afraid of.

they won't harm you,

—Oh! Are you crazy?
—I'm looking for my little sister.

900
01:13:55,815 --> 01:13:58,526
Have you seen a girl walking this way?

901
01:13:58,610 --> 01:13:59,611
Is She lost?

902
01:13:59,694 --> 01:14:03,740
I think She's trying to walk to the
hospital. She's only four years old.

903
01:14:03,823 --> 01:14:06,284
Oh. I didn't see her. Did you?

904
01:14:06,367 --> 01:14:08,620
No. We just came from the hospital,

905
01:14:08,703 --> 01:14:12,290
and there was no Sign of
a little girl on the road.

906
01:14:12,373 --> 01:14:14,667
Okay. Thanks.

907
01:14:14,751 --> 01:14:17,462
-Wait. Where'd you Say you're from?
-From Matsugo.

909
01:14:19,172 --> 01:14:22,133

-Mmm-mmm.

916

-Check all around.

I'm sure that Mei got lost
on her way to the hospital.

they found a Sandal in the pond.
