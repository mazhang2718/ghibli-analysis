3
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:16,017
<i>Mr. Raccoon, Mr. Raccoon,
Come on out and play</i>

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,520
<i>Some other time
I'm having dinner now</i>

5
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,522
<i>What are you eating?</i>

6
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,649
<i>Pickled plums and radish</i>

7
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,693
<i>Can you give me some?</i>

8
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:28,863
<i>Don '2' be such a greedy bum
Gel' your own!</i>

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:36,537
POM POKO

10
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:46,547
We used to live near a farmhouse.

11
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,926
But not to steal their food.

12
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:52,887
In the farms and fields...

13
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:57,058
there are always frogs,
grasshoppers, mice, moles...

14
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,268
persimmons and mulberries.

15
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:03,022
Much more food than
in the mountains.

16
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:08,736
Then suddenly last spring
the humans went away.

17
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:13,699
They didn't come back,
so we decided to move in.

18
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:28,380
That was such a wonderful year.

19
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:32,301
A house with a garden,
it was like a dream!

20
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,803
But then...

21
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,987
We usually don't have strict
rules about territory.

22
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,073
But this was different.

23
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:57,493
Wherever we went for food,
we came up against others.

24
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,913
There were fights
and our territory was invaded.

25
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,123
And finally...

26
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,836
<i>Pom Poke Year 31, autumn.</i>

27
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:10,589
In the clear-cut forest
of Taka near Suzu...

28
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,802
the raccoons of the Tama Hills
faced their final battle.

29
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,836
Gonta the Brave led the Taka forces.

30
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,716
Seizaemon the Elder
led the raccoons from Suzu.

31
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:03,475
It's a little-known fact,
but when humans aren't around...

32
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:08,063
raccoons stand and walk
on two legs, just like this.

33
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:04,870
The battle was fierce
but it didn't last long.

34
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:11,460
<i>Fight, fight! Taka!
Fight, fight! Suzu!</i>

35
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,755
<i>Taka win! Suzu win!
Both of you lose.</i>

36
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,466
<i>Let the losers be killed.</i>

37
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:23,472
<i>Taka's forest is gone today.
Suzu's will be gone tomorrow.</i>

38
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,475
<i>Too many raccoons,
no place to live.</i>

39
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,478
<i>Too many raccoons,
where will they go?</i>

40
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,523
<i>There's no place to go.
You're all finished.</i>

41
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,818
<i>Taka win! Suzu win!
Both of you lose.</i>

42
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:38,320
<i>Let the losers be killed.</i>

43
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,532
<i>Let the losers die
for the sake of all.</i>

44
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:46,996
<i>It will be a blessing!
The fewer the better.</i>

45
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:51,959
<i>You survivors, take care!
Have no more babies.</i>

46
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:56,797
<i>Or there won't be
enough forest to hold them.</i>

47
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,679
Urged on by Granny Oroku...

48
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,099
the raccoons looked and
were stunned by what they saw.

49
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,101
The hills had vanished...

50
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,687
and the earth
had been stripped bare.

51
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,648
The land was empty and cold.

52
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,734
It's insane!

53
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,653
This is no time for fighting!

54
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,702
In the 1960s,
Japan's economy was booming.

55
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:32,124
Demand for housing
near Tokyo skyrocketed.

56
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:39,548
Construction spread to the hills
and farmland surrounding the city.

57
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:44,970
The biggest housing development
was called Tama New Town.

58
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:50,684
30,000 acres would be developed
for 300,000 people.

59
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:55,064
Mountains were deforested,
stripped and leveled.

60
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,233
Farms were bulldozed,
old houses were demolished.

61
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,697
The Tama Hills became a
residential development.

62
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:08,077
The forested hills became
a sprawling suburban community.

63
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,705
It was the largest urban
development project ever.

64
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,169
Those humans are truly amazing.

65
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:21,924
I always believed
they were animals just like us.

66
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:29,556
But now I think humans
must be as powerful as gods.

67
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,021
There was no time to lose.

68
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:40,275
The raccoons gathered
from all over the Tama Hills...

69
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:45,072
for a midnight meeting
in the abandoned temple of Manpukuji.

70
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:51,829
Tsurukame the priest was 105.
He was the chairman of the meeting.

71
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:55,332
Given this dire situation...

72
00:06:55,666 --> 00:07:00,087
we must give up our
nocturnal habits...

73
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:04,716
and be ready for action
during the daytime.

74
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:09,471
Their plan was to try
to stop the development.

75
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,725
Then it's unanimous!

76
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,813
The meeting broke up at once.

77
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,650
All decisions would be
made by the council of elders.

78
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:27,239
They announced a 5-year plan
to study the humans...

79
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:31,243
and revive the ancient art
of transformation.

80
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:35,622
Messengers would be sent
to far-off Shikoku and Sade...

81
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,917
to seek help from
famous Transformation Masters.

82
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,171
But the journeys
would be perilous.

83
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,259
Nobody volunteered to go.

84
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,179
They all pretended to be asleep.

85
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:55,350
I suppose we'll just have to
leave it to the younger raccoons.

86
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,021
Agreed!

87
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,483
Getting down to business...

88
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:07,446
they proceeded to research
McDonald's hamburgers.

89
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,699
The meeting ended
with everyone well satisfied.

90
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,129
NO DUMPING

91
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:31,678
They decided that an old TV
would be the best way...

92
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:35,682
to collect in-depth
information on humans.

93
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,067
<i>Good evening.</i>

94
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,360
Good evening!

95
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:50,489
The TV aroused great interest.

96
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,497
Raccoons started to hang out
at headquarters...

97
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,501
just to watch the TV all day.

98
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:10,342
Transformation requires extreme
physical and mental discipline.

99
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:15,138
Truly, shape-shifting
is the greatest miracle.

100
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:20,769
Less-skilled animals like chameleons
use mimicry.

101
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:26,608
Only raccoons, foxes and
a few cats can transform themselves.

102
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,945
Gonta!

103
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:33,365
See how you did that?

104
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,161
You already have
the gift of transformation.

105
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:43,959
It's quite easy once
you get the hang of it.

106
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,794
At least in theory.

107
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,549
I'll give you a demonstration.

108
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,219
Don't you need a big leaf?

109
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,638
That's only for beginners.

110
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,189
It's been a while.

111
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,404
With Granny Oroku
as their teacher...

112
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,616
transformation training
proceeded rapidly.

113
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:22,456
All the youngsters were eager
to practice their new skill.

114
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,000
Excellent, Shokichi!

115
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,891
I've always been
interested in humans.

116
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:45,187
We're not supposed to get
too close to them...

117
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,982
but my dear departed father
never stopped me.

118
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,528
Detailed knowledge of humans
is the key to transformation.

119
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:57,366
Dad knew it would be
useful for my future.

120
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,889
Of course, some students
lagged behind.

121
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:24,726
In fact, many were just hopeless.

122
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,652
The key to transformation is
extreme discipline of mind and body.

123
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:38,198
Foxes work hard at it,
but raccoons are easily distracted.

124
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,575
Some of them played hooky.

125
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,162
Hey!

126
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,212
Ponkichi!

127
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,924
<i>Ready, set,
let's all transform!</i>

128
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:02,264
My friend Ponkichi never got
the hang of transformation.

129
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,935
He just wanted to be
an ordinary raccoon.

130
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,399
A human looked up
at the evening sky...

131
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,610
and saw the moon
rising over the mountains.

132
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:20,240
Then a tree branch
blocked the moon.

133
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:25,454
The human said, âThat's strange.
There was no branch before.â

134
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:30,751
The branch disappeared and
stuck out on the other side.

135
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,755
The human saw this and said...

136
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,632
âWait! There were
branches on both sides.â

137
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:41,303
So a branch stuck out
on the other side too.

138
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,848
Then boom, both branches fell.

139
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,142
What really fell?

140
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,435
A raccoon!

141
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:52,439
Yes! And why did he fall?
Gonta?

142
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,442
Because he was stupid.
I would never fall.

143
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,819
Good. That's the spirit.

144
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,281
Sasuke, why did he fall?

145
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,284
He lost hold of the tree.

146
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:09,289
Very good. And what
does this teach us? Shokichi?

147
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,794
That you shouldn't believe
everything humans say.

148
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,295
Right.

149
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:20,675
We raccoons are too trusting.
It's easy for humans to fool us.

150
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,513
Then we get into trouble.
Does everyone understand?

151
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,056
Yes, Tsurukame.

152
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:30,685
Now, what if I start singing?
Raccoon, raccoon

153
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,313
<i>Come on out and play.</i>

154
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,442
<i>We're in the middle of a lesson!</i>

155
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:42,447
See? You fell for it.
That's what I was afraid of.

156
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:03,510
The raccoons were still
hard at work when spring arrived.

157
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:08,098
Flowers were blooming.
It was the season for love.

158
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:12,602
Following Granny Oroku's warning...

159
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,856
many of the raccoons
abstained from mating...

160
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,025
to keep the population
under control.

161
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,361
Especially the females.

162
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,781
They controlled their maternal
instincts with firm willpower...

163
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:28,159
rejecting the lovesick
advances of the males.

164
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,502
Meanwhile, work continued
on the massive development.

165
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:41,423
More forest disappeared,
more land was cleared for housing.

166
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,259
The raccoons were sad and angry.

167
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,387
They called the site âthe bald hillsâ.

168
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,350
<i>Mr. Mailman, you dropped something.</i>

169
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:56,938
The females, who were just
as independent as the males...

170
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,442
were also just as skilled
at transformation.

171
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:07,073
When males transformed into girls,
it sometimes looked unnatural...

172
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,492
so the females coached them.

173
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:15,415
Some females also
transformed into men.

174
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:23,632
Class is over, but I want
the boys to stay here.

175
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:29,930
One day Tsurukame
gave the males a special lecture.

176
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:37,145
Boys, there's something special
about the mat you're sitting on.

177
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,316
I won't beat around the bush.
It's my testicles!

178
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,154
150 square feet.
Here's your proof.

179
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,629
After basic training,
the students went into the field.

180
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,633
It's like learning to drive.

181
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:10,470
You need someone experienced
to come with you...

182
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:14,641
and back you up
if you get in a tight spot.

183
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,676
The art of transformation
requires a great deal of energy...

184
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,554
especially when transforming
into humans.

185
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:58,810
The dark circles around raccoons' eyes...

186
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,187
are from sheer fatigue.

187
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,648
Even experienced transformers...

188
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:09,029
...need an emergency energy boost
every now and then.

189
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:14,743
Too much fatigue might mean
changing back into a raccoon.

190
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:23,543
Recently, fast-acting energy drinks
have become very popular.

191
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,839
To graduate from field training...

192
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:33,553
each student had to work
as a human and earn 1,000 yen.

193
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,680
I'm beat!

194
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,893
Some raccoons pretended
to be one worker.

195
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:44,064
Others posed as monks
begging for alms.

196
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:49,277
A few females worked in bars
to earn money for energy drinks.

197
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,239
One even tried his
luck at pachinko.

198
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,077
One broke into
a temple donation box.

199
00:17:57,202 --> 00:18:02,916
But all he got was a few coins.
Granny Oroku saw right through him.

200
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:09,547
I told you,
never turn leaves into money!

201
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:21,768
An urgent report interrupted
Gonta's training at headquarters.

202
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:26,606
He rushed to the Taka Forest
and was shocked by what he saw.

203
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:30,026
Developers had turned
his homeland into bald hills.

204
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,990
Furious, he rushed back
to headquarters.

205
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,285
He called a meeting
of the council...

206
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,455
and demanded total war
against the humans.

207
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,291
I'm against it.

208
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,417
Why?

209
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,421
It's too soon.
You need more experience.

210
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:54,676
We finished our training.
We can do great things.

211
00:18:55,218 --> 00:19:00,849
What do you think, Granny?
Are they up to it?

212
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,686
They certainly have the basic skills.

213
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,104
But...?

214
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:11,693
They lack experience.
The humans might see through them.

215
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,406
We need to know, Gonta.
Why are you proposing this?

216
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:20,827
Is it because of what happened
to your home forest?

217
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:21,953
Is that it?

218
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:29,961
No, I swear. It's for the happiness
of all the raccoons in Tama.

219
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,839
What a lot of nonsense.

220
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:37,969
It was you who tried
to take over Suzu forest.

221
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,722
Shut up!
Even if you won't join me...

222
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,849
the Taka raccoons will fight.

223
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,060
If Gonta's going,
then I'm going too.

224
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,062
You Will, Shokichi?

225
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,981
Thanks!

226
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:54,527
All right men,
there's no turning back now!

227
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,071
Wait!

228
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,200
You can't stop us, Granny.

229
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:05,038
I'd better teach you
a special skill for emergencies.

230
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:14,214
If the humans see through you,
this disguise will last for five days.

231
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,008
Well, what is it?

232
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,261
A dead fox.

233
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,555
<i>Pom Poke '(ear 32, summer.</i>

234
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,308
Gonta and a band
of brave followers...

235
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:29,270
set out to test
their new transformation skills...

236
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,857
in a surprise attack
on the humans.

237
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,860
Their counterattack had finally started.

238
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,208
Here they come!

239
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:59,050
This way! This way!

240
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,266
We did it!

241
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:56,316
<i>This afternoon, at the
Tama New Town site...</i>

242
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,193
<i>five more workers
were killed or injured...</i>

243
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,488
<i>in a landslide and accident
involving a trailer.</i>

244
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:07,035
<i>One building under construction
was completely destroyed.</i>

245
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:12,540
<i>Heavy rains and poor visibility
were blamed for the accident.</i>

246
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:16,878
<i>Because so many accidents
have occurred simultaneously...</i>

247
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:21,341
<i>questions are being asked
about the project's overall management.</i>

248
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,551
<i>Local residents are concerned...</i>

249
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:28,014
<i>and some are demanding that
the development be cancelled.</i>

250
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,061
Hold on there!

251
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:37,732
The humans who died
were victims of this war.

252
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:42,862
First we should pay our respects
to the memories of those who died.

253
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,239
Tsurukame is right.

254
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:51,245
Let's have a minute
of silence for the victims.

255
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,372
Hurray!

256
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,374
Minute of silence!

257
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,376
Let us remember.

258
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:17,939
- We won! We won!
- Let's celebrate! A big party!

259
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,430
Gonta's back!

260
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,350
The heroes have returned.

261
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,314
You did great, Shokichi.

262
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:07,947
You young people
give us hope for the future.

263
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,617
And we're just getting started.

264
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:16,998
Listen up!
Everyone must join the fight.

265
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:23,171
We'll kill them! Destroy them!
Run them out of these hills forever!

266
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,798
Say something, Shokichi.

267
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:31,637
Then we'll plant lots of
our favorite persimmon trees.

268
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:35,975
<i>Hurry, persimmon seed,
sprout' a free</i>

269
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:40,188
<i>If you don't, I'll chop you up</i>

270
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:45,359
Out with the humans!
Kill them! Destroy them!

271
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:50,948
All right, that's enough war talk.
Let's just celebrate, shall we?

272
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,951
I'm a little worried about something.

273
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:55,328
What?

274
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,332
Do we have to drive out
every human?

275
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:00,333
Of course!

276
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,961
Can't we let a few stay?
Like before?

277
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:08,341
No! They're our sworn enemies!
They're monsters!

278
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,468
We have to exterminate them!

279
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:15,681
Are you sure?
Of course, I hate them too.

280
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:20,561
Some of them are all right.
No, I hate them all!

281
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,688
But...

282
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,190
But what?

283
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:30,112
If they all go away,
we'll never eat tempura again.

284
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:32,657
Or sardines...

285
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:34,784
Or corn...

286
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:38,037
Hamburgers! Donuts! Fried chicken!

287
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,207
Potato chips! Turkey!

288
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,543
I can almost taste them!

289
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:49,048
Well Gonta, what if we let
a few humans stay?

290
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,551
It can't be helped.

291
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,639
Let's hear it
for Gonta and his men!

292
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:05,523
<i>In the garden of Manpukuji Temple
The moon shines bright.</i>

293
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:11,654
<i>Everyone come out. Come out.
Hurry, hurry, all our friends.</i>

294
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:15,241
<i>Tsurukame, come out!
Everybody look at Granny!</i>

295
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:21,080
<i>You gotta get a look!
Everyone's gotta get a look!</i>

296
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:27,169
<i>The government has declared that
the needs of a growing population...</i>

297
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:34,927
<i>are too urgent to even consider
cancelling the New Town project.</i>

298
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:37,638
- Hey!
- What did he say?

299
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,518
It was an unfortunate accident.

300
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:49,317
Brave Gonta suffered compound
fractures and ruptured organs.

301
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:52,612
He would be sidelined
for at least a year.

302
00:26:55,948 --> 00:27:00,244
The news report cast a pall
of gloom over the celebrations.

303
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,998
But the humans' fear
of divine retribution...

304
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:07,501
gave the raccoons a new idea.

305
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:12,798
<i>Maybe it was a mistake
to tear down those shrines.</i>

306
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:13,758
<i>What do you mean?</i>

307
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:19,263
<i>Maybe the guardian spirits
are punishing us with these accidents.</i>

308
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:23,309
<i>I hear you had to relocate
many of the shrine statues.</i>

309
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:26,854
<i>Of course we made offerings
to the spirits...</i>

310
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:30,650
<i>...and held purification rites first.</i>

311
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:33,152
<i>What do you think, Professor?</i>

312
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:39,533
<i>Each locality has its own
guardian gods and spirits.</i>

313
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,995
<i>Altering the landscape
without their permission...</i>

314
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,499
<i>will naturally invite their anger.</i>

315
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:53,214
<i>I think there is a lo!
more bad luck f0 come.</i>

316
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,802
I have an idea.

317
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:04,850
The raccoons promptly put
Shokichi's idea to the test.

318
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:17,196
When one of the land owners
checked his property before selling...

319
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:22,243
he found more guardian statues
than he was expecting.

320
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:26,789
He decided it might be better
to delay the contract.

321
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:33,713
The purification rite at a shrine
that was about to be relocated...

322
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:38,426
was interrupted by a raccoon
posing as the shrine guardian.

323
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,886
He appeared on the roof.

324
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:47,601
Terrified by the fox's wailing,
the humans panicked...

325
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,604
and the relocation was cancelled.

326
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:56,527
Instead, the residents requested
that the new road be diverted.

327
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,947
Now the raccoons were fired up.

328
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:13,961
They competed with each other
to use their transformation skills...

329
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,422
in this new guerrilla war.

330
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,300
<i>Come this way.</i>

331
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,472
<i>Leave our forest alone.</i>

332
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:29,351
<i>Take it with you.</i>

333
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,732
Let's pack the leftovers.

334
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,484
Wait!

335
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,986
<i>Leave the food.</i>

336
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,619
ls something wrong, miss?

337
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,709
What's the matter?

338
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:06,222
I have no face.

339
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,184
A goblin!

340
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,177
L...I just saw...

341
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,136
A murder?

342
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,138
No.

343
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,183
Not a murder? Oh, well.

344
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,395
It was a woman.

345
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,729
A vampire?

346
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,899
No, she was...

347
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:03,362
Did she look something like this?

348
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,672
Did she...

349
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:26,719
look something like this?

350
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:39,023
It was such fun
scaring the humans...

351
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,943
that they decided
to have another party.

352
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:50,951
But the hero of the first battles
was disappointed that his injuries...

353
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:53,579
were not healing quickly.

354
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:59,919
His wife nursed him well,
but he was not ready to fight.

355
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:03,339
He thought the others
were losing their aggressive spirit.

356
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:08,802
Last night's news was great!
âGoblins appear in New Town.â

357
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:14,141
That cop was on the show.
Everyone laughed at him.

358
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,353
He lost his temper.
I laughed myself sick.

359
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,858
Idiots! Do you think
this will stop the project?

360
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:27,363
If you're going to transform,
do what I did.

361
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:30,157
Kill the humans!

362
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:38,290
Just as Gonta predicted,
the construction didn't stop.

363
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:42,169
Rivers were lined
with concrete.

364
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:45,839
Roads were cut
through the bald hills.

365
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,009
Housing construction
was already under way.

366
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:54,306
However, the mysterious incidents
received so much media coverage...

367
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:59,478
that the New Town goblins
were famous all over the country.

368
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:02,773
The raccoons' spirits rose
higher and higher.

369
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,867
<i>Pom Poke Year 32, autumn.</i>

370
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,162
The raccoons competed
for the honor...

371
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,999
of going in search
of the Transformation Masters.

372
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:24,712
Tamasaburo was chosen
to journey to Shikoku.

373
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,549
Bunta would go to Sado.

374
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,221
At the next full moon...

375
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:39,393
the two young raccoons
set off on their long journeys...

376
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,938
after a tearful farewell.

377
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:01,749
The others settled down
to wait for the Masters...

378
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,419
while they continued
to haunt New Town.

379
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,179
Even if it didn't stop
the development...

380
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:19,266
it was their favorite sport.

381
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,200
Daddy!

382
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:05,479
Can we really chase the humans
away with these cheap tricks?

383
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:11,151
What if we slip up
and they see through us?

384
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:16,115
Should we fight like Gonta says?

385
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:21,328
No, killing one or two humans
won't make any difference.

386
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,127
To go on or not to go on.
That is the question.

387
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:39,555
<i>KW o'?</i>

388
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,561
What are you doing?

389
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,316
Does your neck hurt?

390
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:57,197
I was posing. I thought you
might say I was pretty.

391
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,699
Oh, sorry.

392
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:01,702
Now my neck really does hurt.

393
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,078
You looked pretty.

394
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:04,913
Too late.

395
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,999
But I mean it.

396
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,172
It's okay.
I'm out of practice anyway.

397
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:29,521
Everyone likes that song.
I guess I do too.

398
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:32,107
How about âWhere Are You From?â

399
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,526
Nobody sings that now.

400
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:35,736
That song...

401
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:41,867
<i>A raccoon was on Senba Mountain
Along came a hunter..</i>

402
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,661
A hunter killed my grandpa.

403
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,165
Sorry, I didn't know.

404
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:49,750
It's okay.

405
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:53,962
But they didn't eat him,
like in the song.

406
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:57,716
They sold his pelt
for a lot of money.

407
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,177
Your pelt's pretty too.

408
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:03,555
I was hoping you'd say that.

409
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,019
What about that song?

410
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:15,442
My dad used to sing it.
He was a good ball bouncer too.

411
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,612
He must have been a character.

412
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:24,534
And when he finished singing,
he would always start preaching.

413
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:26,245
What did he say?

414
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,373
âListen well, children.â

415
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,625
âLike the song says...â

416
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:35,587
âthey kill us, cook us
and eat us.â

417
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:39,466
âHumans are cruel by nature.
That's what the song says.â

418
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,430
Hey, let's play ball.

419
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:46,932
Are you good?

420
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,809
Sure am.

421
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:55,649
Now it's my turn.

422
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,993
<i>Where are you from?
From Higo... Where's Higo?</i>

423
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:09,371
<i>From Kumamoto... Where's Kumamoto?</i>

424
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:14,501
<i>From Senba... Where the mountains
are full of raccoons.</i>

425
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:19,798
When are you going out
on that raid you talked about?

426
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:22,634
I'm getting tired of that stuff.

427
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:25,220
But I liked your idea.

428
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,305
Really?

429
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,932
Why don't we do it tonight?

430
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,684
Together?

431
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,061
Are you afraid?

432
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,565
No, it's not that, but...

433
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,736
Then let's do it.
It'll go just fine.

434
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:45,365
Okay, you're on.
With you, I'm sure it'll go great.

435
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:47,367
I'm so happy!

436
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:01,048
My, what adorable little children.

437
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,636
We just got back from the stars,
but now our house is gone.

438
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:08,638
The stars?

439
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:14,019
From the red-eyed Scorpion,
we crossed over the Eagle's wings.

440
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:18,774
We looped the coiled Snake,
to the top of the Bear Cub's brow.

441
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:24,237
We scatter dew and frost
as we travel through the stars.

442
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,782
Who are you two, anyway?

443
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,704
We're lost and we're cold!

444
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,665
Mister, do you know
the way home?

445
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:40,420
We don't know
what you're talking about.

446
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:43,757
We don't know.
Now go away!

447
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,426
Better call the cops.

448
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:10,450
They're not kids. They're gremlins!

449
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,413
Forgive us!
Forgive us, little gremlins.

450
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,812
Wait a minute.
We can work this out.

451
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,273
Come on,
I'll raise your pay.

452
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:44,943
I'm going home.
I can't take it any more.

453
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,904
This place gives me
the creeps.

454
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,824
Come on, don't say that.

455
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,785
I heard Tokyo
was a scary place...

456
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,954
but this is too much.

457
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,999
You better forget
this whole project.

458
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:02,669
Something doesn't want it to happen.

459
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:12,471
The raccoons cheered.

460
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:16,141
That night's party was
especially grand.

461
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:21,354
The heroes of the evening
were Kiyo and Shokichi.

462
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:31,364
The construction site
was quiet and deserted.

463
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,201
But next morning...

464
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,997
More humans showed up
to continue the work.

465
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,500
Despite the raccoons' hard work...

466
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:45,170
there seemed to be
an unlimited supply of humans.

467
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:51,384
<i>Some say these strange events
are the work of foxes or raccoons.</i>

468
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:59,226
<i>If that were true, all we'd need
to do is kill a few animals.</i>

469
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,270
This made the raccoons at
headquarters very nervous.

470
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:07,734
<i>But it's just like the old folktales.</i>

471
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,195
<i>No wonder rumors are spreading.</i>

472
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:14,741
<i>Whoever is spreading them
must want the project to fail.</i>

473
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:18,161
<i>Rumors?
We saw it with our own eyes!</i>

474
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:25,293
<i>Very well. We'll just have to get rid
of these dangerous animals.</i>

475
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:30,173
<i>Just let us know when you catch them.</i>

476
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:33,426
That is, if you can prove they did it.

477
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:40,892
It was starting to look as if
transformation wouldn't be enough.

478
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:45,605
Long ago, there was
a golden age of raccoons.

479
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,441
The art of metamorphosis
was at its peak.

480
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:53,905
Raccoons were a favorite subject
for artists and writers.

481
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:59,786
But we abused our powers.
The humans turned against us.

482
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:05,792
As Japan modernized,
we were trapped by the thousands.

483
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,254
Our pelts became
brushes and fur collars.

484
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:12,966
This was their revenge,
but we brought it on ourselves.

485
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:18,305
You must learn from this
terrible experience.

486
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,475
Remember that we have
been able to live in peace...

487
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:27,939
only because we stopped
using our powers recklessly.

488
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,318
Transformation is a great gift.

489
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,945
But if used carelessly...

490
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,616
it will only rekindle
the humans' desire for revenge.

491
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:40,285
I urge you all to be careful.

492
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:48,460
The young transforming raccoons
were not sure what to do next.

493
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:52,631
But now it was autumn,
the best season for raccoons.

494
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:57,135
It was time to
store up fat for the winter...

495
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,472
and grow their
thick winter coats.

496
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:22,702
They forgot about transforming and
stuck to the job of getting food.

497
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:31,169
One day, an exhausted raccoon
arrived at the construction site.

498
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,897
It's okay, we're raccoons.

499
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,736
Thank you.

500
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:03,118
You look exhausted.
Where did you come from?

501
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:04,911
From Fujino Mountain.

502
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:06,830
Is that in Shikoku or Sado?

503
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:10,834
It's in Kanagawa,
just beyond those mountains.

504
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:15,714
Kanagawa? You mean
you're not from Shikoku?

505
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:21,052
I'm sorry, I seem
to have disappointed you somehow.

506
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:24,305
It's just that we've been
waiting for some visitors.

507
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:28,727
Anyway, what is it
that brought you here?

508
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:32,939
I was looking for the source
of the landfill...

509
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,983
they're dumping on our mountain.

510
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:38,778
According to this raccoon
named Hayashi...

511
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:42,741
dirt and construction
waste was being dumped...

512
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:44,617
in Fujino's forest.

513
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:48,079
The dumping was hurting
the environment...

514
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:53,460
and making survival hard
for raccoons and other animals.

515
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:57,589
To find the source
of this trouble...

516
00:45:57,714 --> 00:46:03,094
Hayashi hitched a ride
on one of the dump trucks.

517
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:16,316
But his transforming skills
were rusty, and he fell asleep.

518
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:21,613
Before he arrived in Tama,
he changed back into a raccoon.

519
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:25,158
It's not just Fujino,
it's other places too.

520
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:28,953
They keep building
dump sites and golf courses.

521
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:33,124
They destroy our hills
and cause us trouble.

522
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:38,296
Then they dump the waste in
Fujino, and cause you trouble.

523
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,882
How far will this insanity go?

524
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:45,970
When I arrived here
I couldn't believe it.

525
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:50,892
I thought for sure the waste
was coming from the big city.

526
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,311
But this isn't the city!

527
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,730
They level one mountain
and dump it on another.

528
00:46:55,855 --> 00:47:00,151
What in the world for?
I don't understand it one bit.

529
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,280
Then if we stop the development...

530
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,909
the Fujino raccoons will be better off too.

531
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:14,791
I'm so grateful to hear you say that!
Please use all your power...

532
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:20,505
to help save our homeland
as well as your own.

533
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:26,010
We'd like to, but unfortunately
it's easier said than done.

534
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:34,185
What happened to Bunta
and Tamasaburo, anyway?

535
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:37,814
When in the world
are they coming back?

536
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,738
There was still no sign
of the Transformation Masters.

537
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:48,032
Now it was winter.

538
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,578
During the raccoons' winter rest...

539
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:54,873
the humans forgot the
âNew Town Goblinsâ...

540
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,417
and people's attention
shifted elsewhere.

541
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:01,838
The media was busy with
the private lives of movie stars...

542
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:04,048
and political corruption scandals.

543
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:12,432
<i>In the garden of Manpukuji Temple.</i>

544
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:16,269
<i>Raining, raining cotton candy,
ice cream, snow cones!</i>

545
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:20,732
<i>All our friends, Pom Poko, Pom!</i>

546
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:24,110
<i>Pom Poke '(ear 33.</i>

547
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:28,740
New Year's morning brought a
fresh blanket of snow.

548
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:36,581
Most of the construction workers
had gone home for the holidays...

549
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:39,792
and were enjoying long-awaited
family reunions.

550
00:48:53,681 --> 00:49:01,606
<i>Our golden bells s Wing and s wing,
though there '.s not a breath of Wind.</i>

551
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:09,614
<i>Baby raccoon sees our swinging balls
and swings his too.</i>

552
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,491
We really saw them.

553
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:14,327
A bunch of raccoons did it.

554
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:15,620
It's the truth!

555
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,499
<i>Three workers at the
Tama New Town construction site...</i>

556
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:21,960
<i>were arrested
for destroying a bulldozer.</i>

557
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:24,671
<i>They maintain
that raccoons did it.</i>

558
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:29,300
<i>Investigations are under way,
but the snow has already melted.</i>

559
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,636
Look what you've done now,
Shokichi.

560
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,180
It's no big deal.

561
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,182
The whole thing's pointless.

562
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:42,480
He was just trying to
help the others participate.

563
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,524
What do you think, Tsurukame?

564
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:48,319
I think it Will be okay.

565
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,989
Tsurukame was right.

566
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,659
The workers were released
for lack of evidence.

567
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:59,998
The raccoons weren't blamed.
The case remained a mystery.

568
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,884
Spring came at last.

569
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,973
Once again, the season for love.

570
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:20,685
The raccoons had been
chaste for over a year.

571
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,645
Now they couldn't resist.

572
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:28,067
Courtship rivalries and
sweet nothings filled the air.

573
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:31,070
Even the sky was rose-colored.

574
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:37,368
Wait up, Hanako!

575
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,884
Hanako, wait!

576
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:55,720
You can't catch me!

577
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:00,767
Everyone has spring fever.

578
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:06,898
We're just like trees and flowers.
When spring comes, the sun shines.

579
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:08,900
Our flowers blossom...

580
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:12,779
and we bear fruit.

581
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:18,743
But we must obey Granny's orders.

582
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:22,955
Until our battle is won,
we will be chaste.

583
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:28,252
Shokichi, you really are
a wonderful raccoon.

584
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:30,963
I'm so glad.

585
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:35,551
Our love is forever.

586
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:38,805
Shokichi!

587
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:50,316
That was their big mistake.
Their love grew passionate.

588
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:55,154
And sure enough,
they ended up like the others.

589
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:59,117
That spring, Shokichi and Kiyo
had four baby raccoons.

590
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:04,223
The previous autumn,
Tamasaburo had finally reached Shikoku.

591
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:08,019
He went to Kincho Shrine,
home of the Masters...

592
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:11,731
to explain the problem
and appeal for their help.

593
00:53:11,898 --> 00:53:14,692
But then he fell ill.

594
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:18,529
Koharu, the Master's daughter,
cared for him...

595
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:20,406
and he recovered miraculously.

596
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:26,412
That spring the two fell in
love and had three babies.

597
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:36,923
In the shrine, the Masters
of Shikoku debated endlessly.

598
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:42,762
They agreed that it was
important for all of Japan...

599
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:48,893
to stop the New Town project.
They had to act quickly.

600
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:53,856
But who would go, and who
would stay to guard the shrine?

601
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:59,278
Hundreds of questions were raised
and discussed from every angle...

602
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:03,282
but no conclusions were reached.

603
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:07,161
Another summit meeting.
They never seem to end.

604
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,122
And on such a lovely day.

605
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:14,126
The year is half gone already.

606
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:17,630
When will they reach a decision?

607
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:22,260
I never want them to decide!

608
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:31,477
When I think of you leaving us
to go back to Tama...

609
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:36,816
I feel so lonely that
I'm sure my heart will break.

610
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:47,201
Koharu, I don't want
this happiness to end either.

611
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:49,662
Then why don't you stay?

612
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:55,835
I'm going to ask Father.

613
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,589
I want you to stay here
and become his successor.

614
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:19,108
While Tamasaburo was absorbed
in the trials of youth...

615
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:23,487
Bunta, who had journeyed to Sado,
roamed the fields and mountains...

616
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:27,825
searching for a Master
called Danzaburo.

617
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:30,536
He searched high and low...

618
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:34,999
but no one he met
had heard of the master.

619
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:46,510
From summer to autumn, the
raccoons faced a serious dilemma.

620
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:50,222
Not only was their
forest disappearing...

621
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:54,727
but the population multiplied
with a spring baby boom.

622
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:59,857
Bad weather caused
an extreme shortage of food.

623
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:04,403
Persimmons, nuts and other
autumn fruits were scarce.

624
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:09,116
Transforming raccoons managed to
get food from the humans...

625
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:13,204
but it wasn't enough to feed
all the babies.

626
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:30,554
Even the non-transforming
raccoons were forced...

627
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,432
to scavenge food from the humans.

628
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:38,729
Some of the careless ones
were hit by cars or caught in traps.

629
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:42,733
Many lives were lost.

630
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,396
I've had enough!

631
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:25,943
It's time to confront the humans.
Right, Shokichi?

632
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:28,988
Are you sure you're all right,
Gonta?

633
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:32,366
Of course! Watch this!

634
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:45,504
This calls for a celebration!
When's the party?

635
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:49,967
Granny, this is
no time for a party.

636
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:56,182
I think we should wait until
the Masters get here.

637
00:57:56,307 --> 00:58:00,227
You too, Shokichi?
I'm sick of you wimps.

638
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:02,980
We mustn't underestimate the humans.

639
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:06,192
If we attack now,
we're sure to lose.

640
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:09,028
We've already waited too long!

641
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:12,531
Hold on.
Let's hear Shokichi's opinion.

642
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:16,994
Until the Masters arrive,
I have three proposals.

643
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:21,665
First, equal distribution of food
to raccoons who can't transform.

644
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:24,168
We should make it a system.

645
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:28,839
Second, a traffic safety training program.

646
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:36,013
Third, a rescue squad for
anyone who gets caught in a trap.

647
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:41,936
Shokichi, you sound
just like a human.

648
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:45,189
No, I'm a full-blooded raccoon.

649
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:52,696
Okay, we'll worry about details later.
For now, let's see who agrees.

650
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:54,365
Hands up!

651
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,158
Agreed!

652
00:58:58,327 --> 00:58:59,870
What is this, Gonta?

653
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:02,164
Shut up! It's a coup.

654
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:07,795
Anyone who stands in our way
will be killed by my guards.

655
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:12,550
Those are dangerous words, Gonta.

656
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:15,427
That's âGonta, Sir!â

657
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:20,057
Hear me out!
The humans are strong indeed.

658
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:23,394
But not invincible.
We can kill them!

659
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:27,731
As the saying goes,
âA cornered mouse will bite the cat.â

660
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,401
A mouse? How?

661
00:59:30,526 --> 00:59:31,735
It's silly.

662
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,738
We'll stake everything on victory.

663
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:39,743
Right. If it fears nothing,
even a mouse can win.

664
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:42,246
We're not mice.

665
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:44,498
Biting a cat won't help us.

666
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:49,837
You know, a mouse would
taste good right about now.

667
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:51,880
Mouse tempura is the best.

668
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:55,134
No, fried mouse nuggets
are tops.

669
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,887
I like 'em breaded
and deep fried.

670
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:02,224
Those crispy fried tails!

671
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:07,605
What are you talking about?

672
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:13,569
All I can say is...
Mouse tempura is my favorite.

673
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:17,323
Listen, Gonta.
As you see, we're not ready.

674
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:22,202
We'd better just wait
for the Masters from Shikoku.

675
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:25,664
I'm sorry.

676
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,959
Just be careful
not to have any more babies.

677
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:33,339
But I guess that's too much
to expect from us raccoons.

678
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:39,178
No! Instead of fewer raccoons,
we need fewer humans!

679
01:00:39,595 --> 01:00:43,891
All the places they've infested
used to be our homes.

680
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:46,185
They're intruders!

681
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:49,688
Drive them out.
Kill them!

682
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:54,318
Drive them out!
Kill them!

683
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,362
Meanwhile...

684
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,462
Hey, Taxi!

685
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,371
I'll tell them we're here.

686
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:00,426
Tamasaburo!

687
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:02,928
I've brought the
Masters from Shikoku.

688
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:08,434
Well done, Tamasaburo!

689
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:23,741
Friends! On the way here, we saw
your devastated mountains.

690
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,576
You have our deepest sympathy.

691
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:31,165
We would like to hold
a general meeting tonight.

692
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:34,084
<i>Pom Poke Year 33, autumn.</i>

693
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:38,464
That evening, the raccoons assembled
to listen to the Masters.

694
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:44,803
There's a good moon out tonight.

695
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:50,309
My name is Hage of Yashima.

696
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:55,564
Soon I will celebrate
my 999th birthday.

697
01:02:56,732 --> 01:03:03,655
Why is Tama being developed
but Shikoku is not?

698
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:09,328
It is because we have protected
our homeland vigilantly.

699
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:15,584
In Shikoku, the humans know well
that if they anger us raccoons...

700
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:18,962
great misfortune will befall them.

701
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:25,010
The humans worship me
and my distinguished companions...

702
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:28,847
at every temple
and shrine in Shikoku.

703
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,600
They bow down before us.

704
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,520
Allow me to
introduce myself.

705
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:39,483
I am the Supreme Leader of Shikoku.

706
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:42,569
My name is lnugami Gyobu.

707
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:50,077
I am Kincho VI,
lord of Kincho Shrine.

708
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:54,581
We shall drive out the humans...

709
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:58,210
by uniting our powers
for a goblin attack.

710
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:01,213
This battle will require us...

711
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:05,342
to merge our spirits
into one powerful force.

712
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:10,097
We three may not even
survive this battle.

713
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:18,397
However, if you complete this
operation flawlessly...

714
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:25,237
you will regain the respect
the humans once had for you.

715
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:32,244
We must be fearless.
If we focus our combined strength...

716
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:37,541
we can stop this insane development.
Stop it in its tracks!

717
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:41,670
We have a full arsenal of tricks.

718
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,549
We have built a great boat.
An unsinkable boat!

719
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:48,927
A boat that will carry us far.

720
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:53,473
Board our boat
and find peace of mind.

721
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:15,412
What a beautiful summer moon.

722
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,957
We like full moons.

723
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:25,756
Let us pray to this moon
for success.

724
01:05:25,881 --> 01:05:28,634
Shall we?

725
01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:46,318
The raccoons began intense
training for Operation Goblin.

726
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:08,131
Congratulations on your 999th birthday!

727
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:14,972
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.

728
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:19,726
Master, please perform that scene
from the Battle of Yashima!

729
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:22,980
Of course, why not.

730
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:11,403
The time is ripe.

731
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:28,045
<i>Pom Poke Year 33.
Year's end.</i>

732
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:31,673
Operation Goblin was about to begin.

733
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:36,553
Slightly cloudy, no wind.
Cool but not cold, humidity 65%.

734
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:38,847
A perfect day for goblins.

735
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:20,222
From ancient times, raccoons
have been skilled at transformation.

736
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:24,810
But this time was different.
Not only their energy...

737
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:29,314
but the energy of the cosmos
itself had to be harnessed...

738
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,943
to guarantee the success
of Operation Goblin.

739
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:38,073
Accumulating and channeling
that energy was vital.

740
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:40,492
Under the direction
of the Three Masters...

741
01:08:40,659 --> 01:08:45,747
the raccoons generated
an indescribable amount of power.

742
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:49,751
Males, females,
skilled and unskilled alike...

743
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:53,630
all contributed their energy.

744
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:59,970
That evening, the raccoons united...

745
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:08,603
to use their full strength as
it had never been seen before.

746
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,651
Hey look!

747
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,116
What's that?

748
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:41,803
<i>Let the trees blossom
in the middle of winter!</i>

749
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:07,866
Wow, a big parade of goblins!

750
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:15,498
I used to see those sorts of things.
Like a parade of foxes.

751
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:19,627
I know, I saw them too.

752
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:24,966
With little lanterns and everything.

753
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:29,846
And the lanterns
would go marching along.

754
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:38,897
I wonder what
that was all about?

755
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,858
Can foxes really do that?

756
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,944
It sure seems like they can.

757
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:51,242
I mean, you can see them.

758
01:12:51,368 --> 01:12:56,164
It's just nerves.
All this talk about goblins.

759
01:12:56,289 --> 01:13:00,710
All those old stories about
foxes and lanterns.

760
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:04,923
It's all in your head.

761
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:11,054
You just think
you saw them marching.

762
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:14,182
Your mind plays tricks.

763
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:22,190
Of course.
It's foolish to believe it.

764
01:13:22,357 --> 01:13:26,069
The human mind
is a frightening thing.

765
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:33,201
You're sure they're real.
But they can't be real.

766
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:38,581
Those are real.

767
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:43,420
They're all in your mind.

768
01:13:48,383 --> 01:13:49,759
Welcome home.

769
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:53,221
Sachiko!

770
01:14:41,019 --> 01:14:43,646
I summon the six elements!

771
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:54,657
Form is emptiness!

772
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:10,984
Master Gyobu!

773
01:16:23,705 --> 01:16:25,206
That was scary.

774
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:30,628
Aw, is it over already?

775
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:33,172
That was so cool!

776
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:36,384
It's time for bed.

777
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:38,386
All right.

778
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:43,600
And brush your teeth.

779
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:49,772
I feel like I was dreaming.

780
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:53,568
Me too.
What could that have been?

781
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:56,946
Maybe UFOs are real too.

782
01:16:57,697 --> 01:16:59,949
Strange things really do happen.

783
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:09,125
Long ago, when the
Matsuyama Clan was at war...

784
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:14,714
Gyobu defected to the enemy,
causing the downfall of his clan.

785
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:19,260
He regretted it so deeply,
that he made a solemn vow...

786
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:21,763
to fight for justice.

787
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:28,269
His death must not be in vain.
Let us carry on his noble ideals.

788
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:32,273
We will fight to the end,
until the day of triumph.

789
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:36,444
<i>Ga-te ga-te para-ga-te</i>

790
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:40,365
<i>Raccoons of the Sweetcake Hills</i>

791
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:46,204
<i>Victory is ours!
We drink lots of sake and transform.</i>

792
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:49,832
<i>Operation Goblin
was a big success!</i>

793
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:56,464
But with all the excitement,
they forgot to monitor the news.

794
01:17:56,756 --> 01:18:01,969
<i>We're looking for video
of this mysterious parade.</i>

795
01:18:02,095 --> 01:18:07,558
<i>No one has come forward yet.
Investigators are perplexed.</i>

796
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:12,522
<i>I shot all that video,
but none of it came out.</i>

797
01:18:12,647 --> 01:18:14,482
<i>This is really weird.</i>

798
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:20,738
<i>The goblin slipped in through
here and it was terrifying!</i>

799
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,491
<i>Nobody could have faked that.</i>

800
01:18:24,617 --> 01:18:27,870
<i>Something fishy
is going on in New Town.</i>

801
01:18:28,496 --> 01:18:31,332
<i>I wish I could move, but...</i>

802
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:35,420
<i>At 12:20 tonight, we will bring
you a special program...</i>

803
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:38,256
<i>with in-depth coverage
of this mystery.</i>

804
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:52,186
As the humans investigate
what happened...

805
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:57,108
they will realize that
this wasn't their imagination.

806
01:18:57,275 --> 01:19:00,820
They'll be face to face
with reality.

807
01:19:01,154 --> 01:19:05,450
Then, when they realize
that their science and logic...

808
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:09,245
are powerless to unlock the riddle...

809
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:14,709
They will be dumbfounded
by the mystery of the cosmos...

810
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:20,715
and realize how insignificant
humanity really is.

811
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:25,678
Good fortune awaits us,
but let's not wait for it.

812
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:31,058
Let's wake it up. Let's celebrate!

813
01:19:31,184 --> 01:19:33,895
Drink up! Sing! Dance!

814
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:41,152
But the next day...

815
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:45,323
things took an unexpected turn.

816
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:51,662
<i>Last night's unauthorized
parade in Tama New Town...</i>

817
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:57,251
<i>was a publicity stunt for Wonderland
theme park, now under construction.</i>

818
01:19:57,919 --> 01:20:01,380
<i>The police investigation is ongoing.</i>

819
01:20:01,506 --> 01:20:02,590
Nonsense!

820
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:09,263
<i>However, local residents confirm that
it didn't look like a publicity event.</i>

821
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:11,474
Of course not!

822
01:20:11,891 --> 01:20:17,063
<i>The president of Wonderland
confessed to last night's stunt.</i>

823
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:18,564
What?

824
01:20:19,232 --> 01:20:28,074
<i>I would like to apologize to the
public for this disturbance.</i>

825
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:29,492
He's crazy!

826
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:35,373
<i>We are still working on the
construction of Wonderland.</i>

827
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:40,670
<i>But to let everyone know what
a splendid park we're building...</i>

828
01:20:40,795 --> 01:20:47,677
<i>we decided to provide
some free entertainment.</i>

829
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:56,727
<i>As president of the park,
I ordered the surprise parade.</i>

830
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:58,896
- Liar!
- What's he talking about!

831
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:04,777
<i>Fortunately, we've received
an enormous outpouring...</i>

832
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:09,240
<i>of enthusiastic praise
and support from the public.</i>

833
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:15,496
<i>We are overwhelmed
at the enormous response.</i>

834
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:19,625
<i>If they must lock me up for this...</i>

835
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:25,256
<i>I'm prepared to pay the price.</i>

836
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:29,844
- What the...
- Why?

837
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:32,263
Something is very wrong here!

838
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:36,267
<i>If they must lock me up for this...</i>

839
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,102
That fool!

840
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:43,900
The news threw the raccoons
into a panic.

841
01:21:44,442 --> 01:21:49,530
Meanwhile, Wonderland's boss searched
for the parade's organizers.

842
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,490
Just find them.

843
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:56,412
I want the organizers.
I don't care what it takes.

844
01:21:56,704 --> 01:22:01,083
I'll pay them whatever they ask.
As much as it takes!

845
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:02,835
It was raccoons.

846
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,921
What? Then get me a raccoon!

847
01:22:05,046 --> 01:22:10,259
Any raccoon.
Contact their manager!

848
01:22:11,761 --> 01:22:15,389
Raccoons? What did you say?

849
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:17,725
I was only joking.

850
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:21,979
Who are you?
How did you get in here?

851
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:27,693
Your secretary. I phoned earlier.
My name's Ryutaro.

852
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:32,073
You seem to be in a tight spot.

853
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:38,329
But only I can contact the people
who staged that parade.

854
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:42,416
All right, I'll give you
a million dollars.

855
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:49,757
While this mysterious stranger
explained his proposal...

856
01:22:49,924 --> 01:22:55,930
the raccoons were enraged that
their glory had been stolen.

857
01:22:56,055 --> 01:23:01,602
They cried with resentment
and sank into helplessness.

858
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:08,025
And since there was no video
of the goblin parade...

859
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:12,154
media coverage tapered off.

860
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:28,713
You're a fox, aren't you?

861
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:38,097
Precisely. I'm Ryutaro,
transforming fox of Tama.

862
01:23:40,141 --> 01:23:43,769
I've heard many tales of
the Great Kincho from Shikoku.

863
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:45,396
This is an honor.

864
01:23:45,563 --> 01:23:52,111
My ancestors were far greater than I.
So tell me, why are you here?

865
01:23:52,403 --> 01:23:55,364
I was deeply moved by
your fabulous parade.

866
01:23:55,823 --> 01:23:57,992
You knew it was us?

867
01:23:58,451 --> 01:24:03,372
Indeed. And I understand your
despair and discouragement.

868
01:24:03,998 --> 01:24:10,755
I see, I suppose as a fox
you would understand.

869
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:15,009
And I knew things
would turn out this way.

870
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,261
You did?

871
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:21,640
Ryutaro invited Kincho
to join him in Ginza...

872
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:26,312
in a private room at a
certain well-known club.

873
01:24:26,437 --> 01:24:28,105
Welcome!

874
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:33,235
Don't worry, all these
ladies are foxes.

875
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:40,326
Would you
prefer them as foxes?

876
01:24:40,618 --> 01:24:43,579
Or shall I have them
change into raccoons?

877
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,084
Let's be frank.

878
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:53,380
Raccoons have no future in Tama.
The foxes already died out.

879
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:56,509
The foxes died out already?

880
01:24:56,634 --> 01:25:01,222
Yes. It's a pity.
Now only a few of us...

881
01:25:01,472 --> 01:25:05,226
survive as humans, like this.

882
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:06,727
Humans?

883
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:10,272
It's the key to survival
in the big city.

884
01:25:10,648 --> 01:25:16,112
I invited you here to persuade
you raccoons to do likewise.

885
01:25:16,237 --> 01:25:17,780
Just a moment!

886
01:25:17,905 --> 01:25:21,909
I understand your shock.
But times like these...

887
01:25:22,368 --> 01:25:24,745
call for drastic measures.

888
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:27,957
You must bear the unbearable.

889
01:25:28,082 --> 01:25:33,754
Your only hope for survival
is to get jobs at Wonderland.

890
01:25:33,963 --> 01:25:38,759
What, and go to work
for our enemy?

891
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:43,931
Let's think calmly. At this point
raccoons have no choice.

892
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:45,975
That much is given.

893
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:51,647
<i>Living as a human fakes big money.
Ano' how do you earn a living?</i>

894
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:54,859
<i>You use the talents you have.</i>

895
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:58,821
The question is which job
would pay the best money.

896
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,616
Unfortunately Wonderland
pays the best rates.

897
01:26:03,117 --> 01:26:05,619
And the benefits are considerable.

898
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:07,872
This is the salary...

899
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:11,000
and these are the benefits.

900
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:16,505
Of course, only I will know
that you're raccoons.

901
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:21,886
Bon appÃ©tit.

902
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:29,810
Let's think about it over dinner.
Enjoy the food, Master Kincho.

903
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:33,731
You must be tired of scraps
from the garbage in Tama.

904
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:35,149
That's not important.

905
01:26:36,317 --> 01:26:38,360
I have one question.

906
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:45,034
If we must live as humans, what
about those who can't transform?

907
01:26:45,159 --> 01:26:47,286
They have to
fend for themselves.

908
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:52,666
At least the strongest
ones will survive.

909
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:56,754
We too had to abandon
our weaker members.

910
01:26:56,921 --> 01:26:59,548
And they... perished.

911
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,927
Yes. It was a
heart-wrenching decision.

912
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:08,265
What a tragedy!

913
01:27:09,642 --> 01:27:15,397
But you raccoons are lucky.
You can eat just about anything.

914
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:18,192
I wouldn't worry too much.

915
01:27:18,776 --> 01:27:21,111
In Kincho's absence...

916
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:26,700
the Tama raccoons gathered
to decide what to do next.

917
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:29,453
But only a handful showed up.

918
01:27:31,372 --> 01:27:33,791
They talked big
but they didn't deliver.

919
01:27:34,959 --> 01:27:38,295
We never should have
waited for them.

920
01:27:38,796 --> 01:27:44,176
I say, âDon't sell the pelt
until you've skinned the raccoon.â

921
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:52,393
Not even Buddha could help us.
We must not blame the Masters.

922
01:27:52,518 --> 01:27:54,103
âTricky like a raccoon.â

923
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:59,358
That's what humans call someone
like the president of Wonderland.

924
01:27:59,525 --> 01:28:02,861
You talk about humans
too much, Shokichi!

925
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:06,699
I'm just trying to learn
more about them.

926
01:28:06,824 --> 01:28:10,744
Shut up!
We must kill all the humans!

927
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:12,663
Control yourself, Gonta.

928
01:28:12,997 --> 01:28:19,003
Our only choice
is to tell the humans...

929
01:28:19,128 --> 01:28:23,424
that Operation Goblin
was the work of us raccoons.

930
01:28:23,716 --> 01:28:29,305
Have you lost your mind?
That's just what we mustn't do.

931
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:35,436
She's right. If they find out,
they'll come after us.

932
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:38,522
But it's so tragic.

933
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:42,943
That parade was a work of art.
Why can't we take the credit?

934
01:28:43,277 --> 01:28:45,195
I can't bear this.

935
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:51,285
I want to shout it out!
We are the ones who did it!

936
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:54,079
But Tsurukame...

937
01:28:54,455 --> 01:28:57,583
how would we get them
to believe us?

938
01:28:58,042 --> 01:29:01,045
We should make
a public declaration.

939
01:29:01,295 --> 01:29:04,715
Call the TV stations
or send letters.

940
01:29:06,133 --> 01:29:09,720
They'll probably think
it's just a prank.

941
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:13,682
Then we'll go on TV and show
them our transformations.

942
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:15,351
That's ridiculous.

943
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:19,730
They'll say it's just a trick
and we'll be humiliated.

944
01:29:20,064 --> 01:29:22,107
This is a waste of time.

945
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:24,109
This much was true.

946
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:28,364
The debate went back and forth,
and on into the night.

947
01:29:30,324 --> 01:29:32,951
This whole discussion
is a waste of time.

948
01:29:33,077 --> 01:29:39,583
But if we turn terrorist,
the humans will kill us all.

949
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:43,087
That's why we shouldn't
reveal our secret.

950
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:46,006
Then there's not much
we can do.

951
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:54,348
Our only hope
is to stick together.

952
01:29:54,473 --> 01:29:56,266
We've got to try again.

953
01:29:56,433 --> 01:30:00,270
We've got to launch
Operation Goblin 2.

954
01:30:01,355 --> 01:30:05,651
What's the point?
It'll fail the same way.

955
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:09,905
We'll perfect a new plan
and a new strategy.

956
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:13,909
You just don't want to do anything.

957
01:30:14,201 --> 01:30:17,955
You're like some stinking girl.

958
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,959
Watch your language, Gonta.
Girls don't stink.

959
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:25,796
Well if they did,
he'd be one.

960
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:29,716
I'm going to get ready
for Operation Goblin 2.

961
01:30:30,134 --> 01:30:32,219
And who will follow you?

962
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:34,972
Who's going to follow you?

963
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:38,892
You watch your mouth!

964
01:30:39,643 --> 01:30:40,519
Knock it off.

965
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:45,023
Listen everyone!

966
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:49,987
There's only one way for us
to avoid conflict...

967
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:55,909
and it requires the use
of our special talents.

968
01:30:57,327 --> 01:31:01,623
Our powers overwhelmed the
humans in Operation Goblin.

969
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:07,796
But unfortunately, they thought it was
the work of men with inhuman talents.

970
01:31:08,422 --> 01:31:10,924
Then what should we do?

971
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,930
We have to be creative.

972
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:22,478
Like Columbus
and his famous boiled egg.

973
01:31:25,772 --> 01:31:28,692
- Wow! That's great!
- Bravo!

974
01:31:29,276 --> 01:31:30,944
Is your plan that creative?

975
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:38,285
From now on, we will live as
inhuman humans.

976
01:31:39,745 --> 01:31:41,663
You must be joking.

977
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:44,833
No, this is no joke.

978
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,877
But what about the others?

979
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:49,046
Where did Tsurukame go?

980
01:31:49,171 --> 01:31:53,300
APPEAL FROM THE RACCOONS

981
01:31:55,886 --> 01:31:58,555
While Tsurukame was absent
from the meeting...

982
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,684
Kincho's plan was rejected.

983
01:32:03,018 --> 01:32:05,812
Raccoon solidarity started to unravel.

984
01:32:07,064 --> 01:32:11,693
Most of the raccoons
went back to gathering food.

985
01:32:11,818 --> 01:32:16,657
Hard-line Gonta went around
recruiting troops for his battle.

986
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:21,036
Master Hage gathered the
non-transforming raccoons...

987
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:24,998
and gave them faith
with a new dancing religion.

988
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:32,089
<i>These are chaotic times.
All we can do is dance.</i>

989
01:32:32,214 --> 01:32:35,342
<i>Save us, merciful Buddha.</i>

990
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:41,348
Look what has become of
venerable Hage.

991
01:32:41,807 --> 01:32:44,226
Tokyo is such a frightening place.

992
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:49,523
In Shikoku, a parade like that
would have an instant impact.

993
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:56,446
Offerings at our shrine would
go up five... no, ten times!

994
01:32:56,863 --> 01:33:01,410
Master Kincho, take me back
to Shikoku with you...

995
01:33:01,535 --> 01:33:04,913
to continue my training.
I can't wait any longer.

996
01:33:06,415 --> 01:33:08,792
Really, Tamasaburo?

997
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:09,710
Yes.

998
01:33:10,752 --> 01:33:13,630
You're ready to be my successor?

999
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:15,465
Yes, Master Kincho.

1000
01:33:15,882 --> 01:33:20,887
I'm relieved to hear that.
But I have to ask you.

1001
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:23,724
You're not the kind of raccoon...

1002
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:28,812
who would abandon
your comrades, are you?

1003
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,982
Of course not. But...

1004
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:33,984
But what?

1005
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:41,241
You've lost everyone's support.
What can we possibly do?

1006
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:44,161
We're not finished yet.
I'll show you.

1007
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:54,463
This is quite a fancy restaurant.

1008
01:33:54,588 --> 01:33:59,760
We spared no expense
to please you.

1009
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:07,476
This is astounding.

1010
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:11,605
We'll be bigger than Disneyland!

1011
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:37,047
To get revenge on the president...

1012
01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:42,135
Kincho and the raccoons
ruined his deal with Ryutaro.

1013
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:44,805
The president told the police...

1014
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:49,017
that raccoons had stolen
a million dollars from him.

1015
01:34:49,142 --> 01:34:50,769
But they wouldn't listen.

1016
01:34:53,647 --> 01:34:57,192
That same day, Gonta's army
began their operations...

1017
01:34:57,317 --> 01:35:01,154
to stop the next phase
of development.

1018
01:35:18,672 --> 01:35:21,007
Attention eco-terrorists!

1019
01:35:21,258 --> 01:35:26,304
Stop interfering with development
and leave these woods at once.

1020
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:30,058
You could be arrested for theft...

1021
01:35:30,183 --> 01:35:34,688
possession of dangerous weapons
and illegal trespassing.

1022
01:35:36,273 --> 01:35:42,946
If you fail to evacuate immediately,
we will use force to remove you.

1023
01:35:55,041 --> 01:36:01,256
Gonta's troops had the police
and workers completely blocked.

1024
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:04,259
They refused to budge.

1025
01:36:04,468 --> 01:36:08,054
By nightfall, both sides
were still holding their positions.

1026
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:20,609
If we can't stop Gonta, we have
no choice but to help him.

1027
01:36:23,236 --> 01:36:29,743
The riot police are already there.
It's too late.

1028
01:36:34,748 --> 01:36:36,124
I'll check it out.

1029
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:40,295
- Stop! You'll be caught!
- We're going too!

1030
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:53,600
Everyone ready?

1031
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:59,981
In the spirit of honor,
if we are sacrificed in battle...

1032
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:05,445
our brother raccoons
will continue to fight...

1033
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:10,659
with undying determination
until our day of victory.

1034
01:37:11,117 --> 01:37:15,956
<i>Our raccoon balls
Sway in the wind</i>

1035
01:37:16,081 --> 01:37:20,669
<i>Back and forth
To and fro</i>

1036
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:25,048
<i>Amen.</i>

1037
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:26,550
Special orders! Stand aside!

1038
01:37:26,675 --> 01:37:28,176
Gonta, wait!

1039
01:37:28,635 --> 01:37:29,678
Let's go!

1040
01:37:46,903 --> 01:37:48,196
Gonta...

1041
01:38:29,863 --> 01:38:33,909
They used their balls
in a last-ditch attack.

1042
01:38:34,701 --> 01:38:37,913
Mr. Raccoon, Mr. Raccoon.

1043
01:38:39,456 --> 01:38:42,375
Just then, in another part
of the forest...

1044
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:45,253
a TV crew was searching
for the raccoons.

1045
01:38:46,212 --> 01:38:48,214
Won't you please come out?

1046
01:38:48,465 --> 01:38:51,885
You can transform
or come as you are.

1047
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:58,099
âWorld Telereporterâ is on your side!

1048
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:04,272
They seem quite reluctant.

1049
01:39:07,233 --> 01:39:11,905
<i>Mr. Raccoon, Mr. Raccoon
Can we talk?</i>

1050
01:39:12,072 --> 01:39:15,742
<i>We have nothing to eat.</i>

1051
01:39:15,909 --> 01:39:20,121
They answered!
The letter we received was genuine.

1052
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:25,627
We want your side of the story.
Won't you come out?

1053
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:29,798
Here they are!
It's the raccoons!

1054
01:39:30,423 --> 01:39:33,760
Are you really responsible
for the goblin parade?

1055
01:39:33,927 --> 01:39:35,762
Yes, we are.

1056
01:39:37,389 --> 01:39:40,308
We want our viewers
to believe you.

1057
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:45,605
Won't you give us a demonstration
of your transforming talents?

1058
01:39:46,231 --> 01:39:49,985
Some of us raccoons
can't transform.

1059
01:39:50,110 --> 01:39:54,322
We need our forest to live.

1060
01:40:02,288 --> 01:40:04,332
Please, raccoons.

1061
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:09,087
If you don't come out,
no one will believe you.

1062
01:40:10,588 --> 01:40:14,009
After all, you contacted us.

1063
01:40:14,134 --> 01:40:17,345
Please stand behind your words.

1064
01:40:18,138 --> 01:40:19,305
Tsurukame!

1065
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:24,686
Please tell the humans
our side of things.

1066
01:40:32,277 --> 01:40:36,823
There's one! He transformed
into a raccoon statue!

1067
01:40:47,292 --> 01:40:50,045
Mr. Raccoon, a word
for our viewers.

1068
01:40:51,337 --> 01:40:55,550
We...We...

1069
01:40:56,009 --> 01:40:56,843
Yes?

1070
01:41:00,013 --> 01:41:02,182
Please go on.

1071
01:41:08,855 --> 01:41:11,524
We staged the parade!

1072
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:16,362
This is our home!
Please don't take it away from us!

1073
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:19,824
This is the wish
of all living things!

1074
01:42:02,992 --> 01:42:06,955
<i>The people I saw yesterday
are gone today.</i>

1075
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:10,708
<i>The people I see today
will be gone tomorrow.</i>

1076
01:42:11,584 --> 01:42:15,296
<i>Nobody knows
about the day after that.</i>

1077
01:42:15,588 --> 01:42:18,424
<i>But someday people will be sorry.</i>

1078
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:23,096
999 years ago, the Battle of Yashima...

1079
01:42:23,221 --> 01:42:26,599
was witnessed by Hage...

1080
01:42:26,724 --> 01:42:29,018
the venerable Master of raccoons.

1081
01:42:29,144 --> 01:42:32,856
He had seen enough.
He was ready to leave this world.

1082
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:38,111
With a song of triumph,
they stretched his massive testicles...

1083
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:41,656
into a treasure ship
adorned with lacquer and gold.

1084
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:49,497
He filled it with treasure,
gold and jewels.

1085
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:54,127
Buddha would carry them
from earth to heaven.

1086
01:42:54,961 --> 01:42:59,632
Singing and dancing,
the non-transforming raccoons...

1087
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:04,512
boarded the ship for their journey
to the shores of bliss.

1088
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:11,853
The treasure ship sailed
down the Tama River...

1089
01:43:11,978 --> 01:43:16,482
beneath the moon,
rocking and swaying.

1090
01:43:16,608 --> 01:43:21,821
The sail filled with wind
and they steered for the sea.

1091
01:43:22,488 --> 01:43:26,326
The river foamed beneath the prow.
The moon glinted off the water.

1092
01:43:26,451 --> 01:43:30,496
The treasure ship sailed on,
rocking under the moon.

1093
01:43:33,499 --> 01:43:37,795
It was like a dream,
with bells, flutes and drums.

1094
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:44,302
Laden with raccoons,
gold, silver and coral...

1095
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:49,057
the treasure ship
sailed away down the river.

1096
01:43:49,182 --> 01:43:54,562
Before it sank beneath the waves,
the others watched tearfully.

1097
01:43:56,481 --> 01:44:01,236
The ship entered the mist
like a dream on a night in spring.

1098
01:44:01,361 --> 01:44:08,117
As they looked up at the moon,
Buddha beckoned them to heaven.

1099
01:44:08,243 --> 01:44:13,081
And they crossed over
to the other world.

1100
01:44:13,331 --> 01:44:17,418
All the raccoons perished
on that journey of death.

1101
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:22,799
A journey with no return,
a journey of death.

1102
01:44:22,924 --> 01:44:25,718
Poor raccoons,
on a journey of death.

1103
01:44:29,514 --> 01:44:33,893
We're no match
for the humans after all.

1104
01:44:54,831 --> 01:44:57,625
Bunta! Is that Bunta?

1105
01:45:01,004 --> 01:45:02,171
Tamasaburo!

1106
01:45:07,218 --> 01:45:10,179
- It's good to see you back!
- Sasuke! Shokichi!

1107
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:15,685
What happened to the elder from
Sado? Master Danzaburo?

1108
01:45:16,602 --> 01:45:21,274
After searching all this time,
I found that 45 years ago...

1109
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:26,029
he was shot by a hunter during
the famine after the war.

1110
01:45:26,571 --> 01:45:30,825
I see.
I was hoping to meet him.

1111
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:34,370
Thanks for your hard work, Bunta.

1112
01:45:39,417 --> 01:45:44,797
Why is everything so different?
I've only been away three years.

1113
01:45:45,631 --> 01:45:47,842
We tried to stop them.

1114
01:45:47,967 --> 01:45:51,721
But nothing is the same.
Or have I gone crazy?

1115
01:45:51,888 --> 01:45:54,432
We know how you feel.

1116
01:45:54,557 --> 01:45:56,100
Was it the humans?

1117
01:45:56,601 --> 01:45:59,354
Yes, this is their work.

1118
01:45:59,604 --> 01:46:05,360
Impossible! Only raccoons could
be this tricky. Not humans.

1119
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:08,654
Those humans cheated us.

1120
01:46:08,905 --> 01:46:12,992
They were raccoons after all.
Old, stinking raccoons!

1121
01:46:14,577 --> 01:46:17,497
Give us back our hills!
Give us back our fields!

1122
01:46:17,705 --> 01:46:21,000
Give us back our home!

1123
01:46:35,348 --> 01:46:36,891
Let's change it back.

1124
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:42,230
Our final operation.
Make it the way it was.

1125
01:46:43,856 --> 01:46:48,611
Why not? We could hit
the humans with one last illusion.

1126
01:46:48,778 --> 01:46:55,868
Interesting. I can see
the old scenery already.

1127
01:46:55,993 --> 01:46:59,664
All right. One more try.

1128
01:46:59,872 --> 01:47:03,668
But, what would it prove
to do something like that now?

1129
01:47:04,043 --> 01:47:06,921
Nothing. But it will be amusing.

1130
01:47:07,046 --> 01:47:10,967
You're right.
A raccoon without a playful spirit...

1131
01:47:11,092 --> 01:47:13,052
is not a raccoon.

1132
01:47:13,386 --> 01:47:16,055
Will you help us too, Kincho?

1133
01:47:16,305 --> 01:47:20,560
Of course, if you don't mind
a little southern flair.

1134
01:47:21,185 --> 01:47:22,395
Ponkichi!

1135
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:25,565
I'm here!
Let's gather everyone who's left.

1136
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:27,650
Can we count on you too?

1137
01:47:27,775 --> 01:47:29,068
Naturally!

1138
01:49:23,766 --> 01:49:26,519
Hey, wait for me!

1139
01:49:40,199 --> 01:49:42,702
Oh, that looks like Mother.

1140
01:49:45,204 --> 01:49:47,582
It's Yotchan. Yotchan!

1141
01:50:16,819 --> 01:50:19,905
That's us when we were little!

1142
01:50:27,413 --> 01:50:28,956
Look, raccoons!

1143
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:31,959
Gosh, they're so cute!

1144
01:50:33,586 --> 01:50:35,254
Look Mom, raccoons!

1145
01:50:35,379 --> 01:50:39,925
They're still around.
Even in a place like this.

1146
01:50:43,929 --> 01:50:46,307
Wait, raccoons!

1147
01:50:50,436 --> 01:50:52,396
Aw, they left.

1148
01:50:53,230 --> 01:50:56,025
I wanted to feed them.

1149
01:50:56,192 --> 01:50:59,111
Can raccoons really change
into something else?

1150
01:51:03,449 --> 01:51:05,826
So we lost our battle.

1151
01:51:06,243 --> 01:51:11,123
And development just goes on,
as if we'd never existed.

1152
01:51:13,209 --> 01:51:16,504
Humans quickly forget
how things used to be.

1153
01:51:16,796 --> 01:51:20,508
At least for them,
life is comfortable.

1154
01:51:21,717 --> 01:51:26,681
Trendy new condominiums
stand on Manpukuji Hill.

1155
01:51:27,181 --> 01:51:29,225
And as it turned out...

1156
01:51:29,392 --> 01:51:35,481
showing ourselves to the humans
had one good effect.

1157
01:51:35,981 --> 01:51:38,401
They take better care of nature.

1158
01:51:38,526 --> 01:51:41,320
They set aside
the last bits of forest...

1159
01:51:41,445 --> 01:51:44,240
and built a few parks.

1160
01:51:44,365 --> 01:51:49,578
âIn harmony with the raccoons,â
as it said in the papers.

1161
01:51:50,496 --> 01:51:56,001
But for us it was too late.
We'd lost our home.

1162
01:51:56,585 --> 01:52:02,800
Some of us went over the mountain
to live in a town called Machida.

1163
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:05,553
But there were
raccoons there already...

1164
01:52:05,678 --> 01:52:07,555
and development
was hurting them too.

1165
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:11,851
Many were killed on the road.
Life got harder and harder.

1166
01:52:14,687 --> 01:52:19,525
So we decided
to bear the unbearable.

1167
01:52:32,663 --> 01:52:38,043
That's right. Those of us
who can transform...

1168
01:52:38,169 --> 01:52:40,713
are living as humans,
just like the foxes.

1169
01:52:41,338 --> 01:52:44,884
I have a desk job.
My wife, Kiyo, works at a bar.

1170
01:52:45,718 --> 01:52:49,138
Some of us got greedy
and made big money...

1171
01:52:49,305 --> 01:52:51,390
by working with the developers.

1172
01:52:51,682 --> 01:52:57,062
But most of us are tired and
want to go back to the forest.

1173
01:52:58,355 --> 01:53:03,235
It's amazing that humans
can actually live like this.

1174
01:53:03,569 --> 01:53:08,282
Some of us dropped out
and survive on scraps...

1175
01:53:08,407 --> 01:53:12,161
from the bars
and clubs of Shinjuku.

1176
01:53:19,251 --> 01:53:22,087
But what about Ponkichi
and the other raccoons?

1177
01:53:49,406 --> 01:53:54,286
No matter how tough
things get, raccoons are survivors.

1178
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:59,333
They bear things without complaint
and live happily and freely.

1179
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:04,672
They have children with a
carefree spirit, and then they die.

1180
01:54:53,846 --> 01:54:56,015
Ponkichi!

1181
01:54:58,183 --> 01:55:00,144
Shokichi!

1182
01:55:03,188 --> 01:55:06,108
- Welcome back!
- You haven't changed a bit!

1183
01:55:28,172 --> 01:55:30,966
On TV, they're saying
that foxes and raccoons...

1184
01:55:31,091 --> 01:55:34,720
have disappeared
because of urban sprawl.

1185
01:55:34,845 --> 01:55:36,722
Could you stop saying that?

1186
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:41,727
Of course, some raccoons
and foxes can transform.

1187
01:55:42,394 --> 01:55:45,731
But what about the
rabbits and the other animals?

1188
01:55:46,398 --> 01:55:48,776
Some of us can't just disappear.

1189
01:56:12,925 --> 01:56:18,931
