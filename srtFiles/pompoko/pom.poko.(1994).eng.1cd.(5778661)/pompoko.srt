00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,670
A Studio Ghibli Film

2
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:11,002
Tokuma Shoten Publishing Nippon TV
Hakuhodo Studio Ghibli present

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,676
Raccoon, Raccoon,
Will you come out and play?

4
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,611
l can't, l'm eating right now.

5
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,748
What are you eating?

6
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:25,358
Pickled plums and radish.

7
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,989
Can l have a bite?

8
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:35,634
POM POKO
THE GREAT RACCOON BATTLE

9
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:46,008
We used to live near the humans.

10
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,243
But no, not to swipe their food.

11
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,644
Where there are farms and fields,

12
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:56,582
There are always frogs and grasshoppers
and mice and moles.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,358
And persimmon and mulberry seeds.

14
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:02,322
Much more food than in the mountains.

15
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:07,856
Then suddenly last spring
the house became vacant.

16
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:13,400
We decided to move in
and make it our nest.

17
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:27,311
lt was a truly wonderful year.

18
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:32,024
A house with a garden,
it was like a dream!

19
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,086
Until one day...

20
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:51,036
Usually we don't have any strict
rules about our territory.

21
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,002
But this was different.

22
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:57,071
Wherever we went for food,
we'd always butt heads with others.

23
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,009
There were fights,
our house was captured,

24
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,047
And finally...

25
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:06,016
Pom Poko year 31 , autumn.

26
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:10,120
Deforestation began in TAKAGA Forest.

27
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:15,557
And the Raccoons of the Tama Hills
faced their ultimate battle.

28
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:48,700
Commander of the Red Army
was Gonta of Takaga Forest.

29
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:53,698
Commander of the Blue Army
was Seizaemon of Suzuka Forest.

30
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:02,178
Not many people know this,
but when humans aren't looking,

31
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:07,109
all raccoons stand on 2 feet.

32
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,599
The battle was brave and intense
but it didn't go on very long.

33
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:10,205
Go, go! Takaga Forest!
Go, go! Suzuka Forest!

34
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,852
Red or Blue, whoever wins
they both will lose.

35
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,089
The loser will be killed.

36
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:22,483
lf the Red dies today,
the Blue will die tomorrow.

37
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,988
Too many raccoons with no place to live.

38
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,757
Where will they go?

39
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,729
There is no place. They'll all die.

40
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:37,499
Whoever wins, Red or Blue,
they both lose.

41
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:41,574
For the sake of all,
they'll be killed.

42
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:46,046
lf they don't all die,
the survivors must not mate.

43
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,484
No more children.

44
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:55,854
Or else there won't be
enough forest to hold them.

45
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,028
At the demand of wild Granny Oroku,

46
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,703
the raccoons looked down at the earth
and they were stunned.

47
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,941
The mountain had completely vanished.

48
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,039
The hills were stripped and flattened.

49
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,643
lt now looked so vast and cold.

50
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,941
This is insane!

51
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,046
This is no time for fighting!

52
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,955
ln the height of
Japan's economic growth,

53
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:31,255
there were increasing demands
for new housing around Tokyo.

54
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:38,834
Chaotic development began in the
farmlands and mountains.

55
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:44,839
This development was known since
1966 as the Tama New Town project.

56
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,203
Total area: 3000 hectares,

57
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,172
Proposed population: 300,000 people.

58
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,548
The mountain was deforested, stripped
and the hills leveled flat.

59
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:58,155
Farms were bulldozed.
Old housed were demolished.

60
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:02,823
The Tama Hills became a
residential development area.

61
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:08,226
PShrubs and trees were added to create
a spacious new bedroom community.

62
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,034
The largest urban development ever.

63
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,741
Wow, humans are really amazing.

64
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,241
l always thought all animals were
the same.

65
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:28,877
But now l think humans must be as
powerful as Buddha and his disciples.

66
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,318
lt was a state of emergency.

67
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,164
A meeting was called one night in
the old temple.

68
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:44,028
All the raccoons in the forest came.

69
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:51,741
The chairman was the 105 year old
priest, Reverend Tsurukame.

70
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,145
Given the dire situation,

71
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:59,607
we must all start taking action
during the daytime as needed,

72
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:04,289
while continuing our nocturnal habits.

73
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:09,387
They decided their course of action
would be to prevent development.

74
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,265
The agreement is unanimous!'

75
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:19,331
Realizing the danger they were in,
they broke up the meeting at once.

76
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,832
All future decisions would be made by
the council of chiefs.

77
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,304
The chiefs decided on a 5-year plan

78
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,043
to bring back the old art of
metamorphosis

79
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,906
and to study human beings.

80
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,777
They decided to summons the
famous masters of 'morphing'

81
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:38,319
from Shikoku and Sado,
to be their teachers of transformation.

82
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:46,324
But nobody would volunteer to be the
messenger on the long journey.

83
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,894
They all pretended to be asleep.

84
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,204
Our only hope

85
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,942
is to wait for the young raccoons
to grow up, and send them.

86
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,472
Agreed!

87
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,806
Getting down to business,

88
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:07,018
they proceeded with their research
of MacDonald's hamburgers

89
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,188
and then ended the meeting.

90
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,799
No Dumping

91
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,508
ln order to gather thorough research
on humans,

92
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:35,244
They set up a TV at headquarters
to catch hourly information.

93
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,721
Good evening.

94
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,888
Good evening.

95
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,956
The TV aroused great interest.

96
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,765
Raccoons came to headquarters
without official business

97
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,165
just to watch the TV all day.

98
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,540
'Metamorphosis' is the
most extreme concentration

99
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,972
of mind and spirit.

100
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,548
To reform the body cells
in a split second

101
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,352
is the world's greatest miracle.

102
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:20,054
Lower animal like chameleons
use 'mimicry'.

103
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:26,094
But true transformation can only be
done by raccoons, foxes, and some cats.

104
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,258
Hey, Gonta!

105
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,536
Look how you did that.

106
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:37,237
You're already learning the first steps
of transforming.

107
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,101
Once you get the hang of it,

108
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,007
anyone can do it ...

109
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,210
...at least in theory.

110
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,787
l'll give you a demonstration.

111
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:52,789
Aren't you supposed to put a leaf
on your head?

112
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,789
That's only for beginners.

113
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,470
lt's been awhile.

114
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,502
With Granny Oroku as their teacher

115
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,311
the revival of metamorphosis was
well under way.

116
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:22,350
All the youngsters were eager to learn
and practice their new skill.

117
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,055
Excellent, Shokichi!

118
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,166
l've always been interested in humans.

119
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,374
We're not supposed to get too close
to them

120
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:48,272
but my father, who passed away,
never stopped me.

121
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,209
A good knowledge of humans

122
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,884
is the foundation of the art of
transformation.

123
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,146
Dad knew it would be useful
in the future.

124
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,407
Of course, not all the students were
brilliant.

125
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,582
ln fact, many were totally awful.

126
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:33,015
The key to transformation is
extreme discipline of mind and body.

127
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,884
This is easy for a fox,

128
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,652
but raccoons are so naturally
easygoing.

129
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,031
As expected, there were some dropouts.

130
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,032
Hey!

131
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,598
Hey, Ponkichi!

132
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:57,414
Ready, set, let's all transform...

133
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,586
l was so into morphing that l couldn't
believe that my friend Ponkichi

134
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:06,117
just wanted to live an ordinary
raccoon's life.

135
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:11,222
At dusk on a mountain pass,

136
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,489
the moon comes out from
behind the mountain.

137
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:19,433
Then a branch from a cedar tree
obstructs the view of the moon.

138
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:24,335
'Funny', the person says, 'there was no
branch there before.'

139
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:29,637
Then the branch disappears and
comes out on the other side.

140
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,443
The human who sees this says,

141
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,745
'No, there were branches on each side.'

142
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,350
Then a branch comes out on the
other side too.

143
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,627
Just then, BOOM, it falls down.

144
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,296
Do you know what fell?

145
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,294
A raccoon!

146
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,535
'That's right. And why did it fall?

147
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:51,298
Gonta?

148
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,664
'Cause he was stupid.
There's no way l would fall.

149
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,041
Good. That's the spirit.

150
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,141
Sasuke, why did he fall?

151
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,705
He made his arms into branches
and forgot to hold on to the tree.

152
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,246
Very good. And what is the lesson
to be learned here? Shokichi?

153
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,548
That you shouldn't listen to
everything humans say.

154
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:13,786
Right.

155
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:19,590
We raccoons let ourselves go too easily.
We give them too much.

156
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:23,495
This is the source of our mistakes.
Does everyone understand?

157
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,270
Yes, Reverend Tsurukame.

158
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,201
So, for example, if l sing:
Raccoon, raccoon,

159
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,636
Will you come out to play?

160
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:36,144
We're in the middle of our lessons.

161
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:37,204
See? You've already fallen for it.
That's what l was afraid of.

162
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,327
While the raccoons were still
hard at work on their studies,

163
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,198
winter had come and gone.

164
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,637
The plum trees were blossoming.
The season for love was here.

165
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,076
Following Granny Okura's orders,

166
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,648
Many of the raccoons
abstained from mating

167
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,720
to keep the population under control.

168
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,158
Especially the females.

169
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,589
They controlled their maternal instincts
with firm integrity,

170
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,765
rejecting the lovesick wooing
of the males.

171
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:36,770
Meanwhile, the work progressed
on the massive development.

172
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,372
As more forest disappeared,
the clear land for housing expanded.

173
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,114
The raccoons were sad and angry.

174
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,815
They called the site the 'flat hills'.

175
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,516
Mr. mailman, you dropped something...
a postcard. l'll get it for you.

176
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,590
The females, who were all raised as
liberated raccoons,

177
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,353
also learned to transform
along with the males.

178
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,800
When males transform into girls,

179
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,295
The voices and gestures can cause
difficulties.

180
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,506
The females help solve these problems.

181
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:15,309
Some females also
transformed into men.

182
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,913
Can l have just the boys
stay after class for a moment?

183
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:28,554
One day the Reverend Tsurukame
gave the boys a special lecture.

184
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:35,299
Boys, there's something hidden
in the mat you're sitting on.

185
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:40,163
What is that?
lt's my golden balls!

186
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:45,142
16 square yards.
Here's your proof.

187
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:02,625
After completing transformation class
the students began to train on street.

188
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,830
Like when learning to drive,

189
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,666
one must be accompanied by
an experienced driver,

190
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,928
to prevent accidents like detection.

191
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:49,197
The art of transformation
requires a great deal of energy.

192
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,375
Especially when transforming
into humans.

193
00:16:53,379 --> 00:17:00,251
The dark circles raccoons have around
their eyes are from their sheer fatigue.

194
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:08,257
Even an experienced raccoon will need
to take along some extra energy.

195
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:14,523
Pf they're too exhausted, they could
change back to raccoons in an instant.

196
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:22,674
Recently, those energy drinks
have done very well on the market.

197
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,369
To graduate from practical training,

198
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:32,481
each student had to peacefully and
single-handedly bring back $10.

199
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,050
Help me!

200
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,687
Some of them transformed into workmen.

201
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:42,621
Others posed as begging monks.

202
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:48,032
Some of the females tried working
at bars.

203
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,965
One even tried his luck at pachinko.

204
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,868
One tricky fellow got his paws on the
donation box at the temple.

205
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,776
But all he got was small change.

206
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,672
Granny Oroku could easily detect
fake money.

207
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,986
l told you never to counterfeit money
out of leaves!

208
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:19,927
Gonta's training at headquarters was
interrupted by an urgent report.

209
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:23,357
He rushed back to his forest and was
enraged by what he saw.

210
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:28,738
More than half of his forest had been
leveled to 'flat hills'.

211
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,705
Furious, he hurried back to HQ.

212
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,581
He called a meeting of the counsel

213
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,479
and proposed aggressive tactics to
drive back the humans.

214
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:45,616
Why?

215
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:49,691
The time is not ripe. lt's only
the 1st year of the 5 year plan.

216
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,728
Pe've all completed our training.
We're already capable of great things.

217
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:58,936
What do you think, Granny?
Can we send them out yet?

218
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,400
They are certainly capable of
the basic skills.

219
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,573
Are they?

220
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:10,606
But they lack the experience.
There is still danger of critical error.

221
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,073
l want to ask Gonta.

222
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:21,455
Son, are you proposing this battle
for your own personal revenge?

223
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,991
No, l swear. lt's for the total
happiness of all the raccoons in Tama.

224
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,569
Total happiness?

225
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,738
You forget, Gonta. A year ago you were
fighting against Suzuka Forest.

226
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:36,941
You were the leader.

227
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,775
Shut up!
Even if you're all against me,

228
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,979
We raccoons from Takaga Forest
are going to fight.

229
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,075
lf Gonta's going to fight,
then l'm going too.

230
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,883
You too, Shokichi?

231
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:53,550
Thanks!
Men, there's no turning back now!

232
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:55,988
Hey, wait!

233
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,156
You can't stop us, Granny.

234
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,726
Just this one time,
l'll teach you a secret skill.

235
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:13,511
Even if you mess up,
this disguise will last five days.

236
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,076
O.K., what is it?

237
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,016
A dead fox.

238
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,451
32nd year of Pom Poko. Summer.

239
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,919
Gonta and his group of supporters
began to risk their lives

240
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,993
in a surprise attack on the humans.

241
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,928
At the same time, a counter-attack
had started.

242
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,978
-They've come!
-They're here!

243
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,214
Come on! Come on!

244
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,962
We did it! We did it!

245
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:51,737
Today at 2:30pm at the development
site of Tama New Town,

246
00:21:55,681 --> 00:22:00,778
Three drivers were killed and
two more were seriously injured

247
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:05,786
in a landslide and an accident
involving a trailer.

248
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:11,325
One building under construction
was completely razed in this disaster.

249
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,730
Heavy rains and poor visibility were
blamed for the accident.

250
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:19,731
Because so many accidents have
occurred at the development sites,.

251
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:26,602
nearby residents are questioning the
integrity of New Town's construction.

252
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,610
Wait a minute!

253
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,012
Those people were victims of this war.

254
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:41,920
We should express our deepest
condolences to those poor humans.

255
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,921
The Reverend is right.

256
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:50,293
Let's have one minute of silent prayer
for the victims' sacrifices.

257
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:51,861
Aye!

258
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,637
-Silent prayer! Silent prayer!

259
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,772
-Silent prayer!

260
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:18,152
-We won! We won!
-Let's celebrate! A big party!

261
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,393
Hey! Gonta!

262
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,296
Our heroes have triumphantly returned.

263
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,628
You did a great job, Shokichi.

264
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:06,975
Thanks to you, we're full of hope.

265
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,447
Heck, today was only a test.
The real battle hasn't even begun yet.

266
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,417
Each of us can take on
a few humans at a time.

267
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:19,847
Crush, kill and destroy them.
Kick them out of our domain!

268
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,786
We mustn't fail!

269
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,354
Say something, Shokichi.

270
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:29,763
And then we'll plant trees!
Lots of persimmon trees!

271
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:38,874
Hurry, persimmon seed, sprout a tree
lf you don't l'll chop you up.

272
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:44,714
Out with the humans!
Kill them! Destroy them!

273
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:50,684
PHold on. Aren't we supposed to be
celebrating this joyous day together?

274
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,281
-l'm a little worried about something.
- What's that?

275
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:58,492
Are we going to kill all the humans
and drive them all out?

276
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,692
Of course!

277
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:03,196
Can't we let a few humans stay?
Like it was before?

278
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:07,302
No! They're our blood enemy!
They're monsters!

279
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,900
They must be banished forever!

280
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:20,779
l guess you're right. l hate them too.
There are some good ones, but...

281
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,314
But what?

282
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:29,226
But if we drive them all away,
we'll never eat tempura again.

283
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:36,998
-Or sardines ...or corn...
-Hamburgers! Donuts! Fried chicken!

284
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,370
Potato chips! Turkey!

285
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:43,497
Aw, rats. l want those things too!

286
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:48,106
What if we let just a few humans stay?

287
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,440
l suppose we have no choice.

288
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,044
-Oh, good!
-Hooray for Gonta!

289
00:25:56,454 --> 00:26:06,887
ln the garden of our temple
The moon shines bright.

290
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:12,165
Everyone come out, come out
Hurry, hurry, all our friends.

291
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:16,373
Reverend Tsurukame, come out!
Everybody look at Granny!

292
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:21,173
You gotta get a look!
Everyone's gotta get a look!

293
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:27,248
Authorities declare that need for
housing for over 1 million people

294
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:34,823
is too urgent to consider delaying
the New Town development.

295
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,220
-Hey...
-What did they say?

296
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,798
lt was an unfortunate accident.

297
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:49,370
The hero, Gonta suffered compound
fractures and ruptured organs.

298
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,303
He would need at least a year
to recover fully.

299
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:59,575
The incoming news threw a
sheet of gloom over the celebration.

300
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:06,117
But they were encouraged by the
local people's superstitions.

301
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:11,521
Perhaps they've been cursed
for tearing down the Suwa Shrine.

302
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,055
What do you mean?

303
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:18,325
They're being punished.
The gods are striking back.

304
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,232
Weren't all the statues of
deities saved?

305
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:29,379
Of course. We held a proper ceremony
before moving them out, but..

306
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,144
What do you think, Professor Mizuki?

307
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:37,845
These gods are the original
guardians of that land.

308
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:44,088
Of course they're angry.
Any god would be.

309
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,327
l think there will be much more
punishment to come.

310
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,065
Hikage Mountain might be saved.

311
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:05,415
Shokichi launched a new strategy.

312
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:15,588
When the owner of the land went
to check the area with the agent,

313
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:22,966
Phe was bewildered to see several
statues of deities on Hikage Mountain.

314
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,700
So he delayed the contract.

315
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:34,976
At another shrine that was to be moved,
Kumataro disrupted the rituals

316
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:41,116
by transforming into the legendary fox,
messenger to the gods.

317
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:46,389
He appeared on the roof
and caused a commotion.

318
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:50,354
The move of the shrine was postponed.

319
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:55,361
lnstead, they requested the authorities
to change the road plans.

320
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,701
The raccoons were all very excited.

321
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:10,977
Each group was driven by competition.

322
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,683
They had all mastered the art of
transformation

323
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,951
and they began
various guerrilla attacks.

324
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,417
Come over here!

325
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,151
Give it up!

326
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,329
Take it away!

327
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:37,297
-Let's not leave anything behind.
-Leave the food!

328
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,174
What's wrong young lady?

329
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,589
Hey, what's the matter?

330
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:11,266
A faceless ghost!

331
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:45,064
-Over there... there was...
-A murder?

332
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,641
-NO...
-Not a murder?

333
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:55,111
-lt was a woman.
-The wide-mouth monster lady?

334
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,116
No, it was...

335
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:03,225
Was it something like this?

336
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:24,842
Was it... something like this?

337
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:37,888
They were having so much fun
spooking the humans so easily.

338
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,661
They all had a big party.

339
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:49,472
Nevertheless, the hero, Gonta was
disappointed that his injuries

340
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,209
were not healing quickly.

341
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:58,215
Pis dear wife, Otama, nursed him well,
but he was still unable to fight.

342
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:02,719
He wasn't pleased with the way
the others were handling things.

343
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:08,114
Last night's news was great!
'New Town is Ghost Town'.

344
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:13,353
That cop was on the show.
They all laughed at him.

345
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,130
He turned bright red and got mad.
lt was so funny.

346
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,530
What are you idiots doing?
How will that stop their work?

347
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:28,403
lf you're going to transform,
do it to kill the humans!

348
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,210
Just as Gonta said,
the construction didn't stop.

349
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:41,420
The river was banked
with concrete.

350
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,322
Roads cut through
the flattened hills.

351
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,962
And construction of housing
was under way.

352
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,729
However, the mysterious incidents
received so much media coverage

353
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:57,766
that the New Town hauntings
were famous all over the country.

354
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,511
The raccoons morale lifted
higher and higher.

355
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,324
32nd year of Pom Poko. Autumn.

356
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:16,992
lt was a big game to decide
who would be the messengers

357
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,623
to bring back the great Masters of
metamorphosis.

358
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:23,392
Tamasaburo would go to Shikoku.

359
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,196
And Bunta would go to Sado.

360
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:41,881
At the next full moon, the two
were sent off on their far mission.

361
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:03,903
After the messengers left, the
youngsters continued spooking.

362
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:14,451
Whether or not it contributed to
stopping the development,

363
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,711
it was their favorite game.

364
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,033
-Out with the devil!
-Hey... Papa!

365
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:04,767
Can we really chase the humans
away by doing these tricks?

366
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:10,470
lf we fail, will they see through
our disguises?

367
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:15,445
Should we fight like Gonta says?

368
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,574
No, killing 1 or 2 people won't
make any difference.

369
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:27,389
To be or not to be...
That is the question.

370
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:43,829
Okiyo,
what are you doing over there?

371
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,038
ls something wrong
with your neck?

372
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:56,580
l'm posing. l thought you might
say l'm pretty.

373
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:57,548
-0h, sorry.

374
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:02,085
-Now my neck really does hurt.
-That was pretty.

375
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,421
-Too late.
-But l mean it.

376
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,927
l'm just rusty, that's all.

377
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:28,947
Everyone likes that song...
l guess l like it too.

378
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,950
Do you like 'Where are you from?'

379
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,818
-Yeah, but nobody sings it.
-That song...

380
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:41,190
A raccoon was on Senba Mountain,
And along came a hunter...

381
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:46,968
-My grandpa was killed by a gun.
-Sorry, l didn't know.

382
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:56,080
But he wasn't cooked and eaten.
His fur was sold for a lot of money.

383
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:59,113
Your fur is beautiful too.

384
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,447
l'm happy you said that, Shokichi.

385
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,684
So what about that song?

386
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:14,498
Oh yeah, my dad used to sing it.
He was a good ball bouncer too.

387
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:17,233
He must have been a character.

388
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:23,967
And when he finished singing,
he would always start preaching.

389
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,505
What did he say?

390
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:30,145
Children, you must never forget.
Like the song says,

391
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:38,145
the true nature of humans is cruel.
That they kill us and eat us.

392
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,717
Hey, let's play ball.

393
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,157
-Are you any good?
-Sure l am.

394
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,901
OK., l got one too.

395
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:04,478
Where are you from?
Higo... Where's Higo?

396
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:12,687
Kumamoto... Where's Kumamoto?
Senba...There's raccoons there.

397
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:20,621
-So, when is Operation Twin Star?
-Oh, l don't really want to do it.

398
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:25,566
-But it was such a great idea.
-Yeah.

399
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,303
-Do you want to do it tonight?
-With you?

400
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,938
Yeah, we can be partners.
Are you scared?

401
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:40,884
-No, it's not that, but...
-O.K., so we'll go. lt'll be great.

402
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:44,849
O.K. let's do it. l'm sure that with
you, it'll be a success.

403
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:46,318
Great!

404
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,003
My, what adorable little children.

405
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:05,806
We just got back from our space
travels and now we're lost.

406
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,769
Space travels?

407
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,982
From the red-eyed scorpion,
we crossed over the eagle's wings

408
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:17,812
We looped the coiled snake,
to the top of the bear cub's brow.

409
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:23,026
And we sprinkled the dew
and frost.

410
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:27,559
What in the world ...are you two?

411
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:34,565
-We're lost and we're cold!
-Mister, do you know our house?

412
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:42,708
-We don't know. Now go away!
-We'd better call the police!

413
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,814
-They're not kids, They're goblins!
-Goblins!

414
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:12,672
Forgive us!
Forgive us, little goblins!

415
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,997
Wait a minute.
We can make a deal.

416
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,737
l'll raise your wages.
l'm asking you to stay.

417
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,872
No way, l can't take any more.
l'm going back home.

418
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,769
This place gives me
the creeps.

419
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,740
Please, don't say that!
Mr. Suzuki.

420
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:54,713
l knew Tokyo was a scary place
but this is too much.

421
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:58,011
l think you should drop
this whole development.

422
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:02,123
Curse or no curse,
Someone is against this thing.

423
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,900
The raccoons cheered.

424
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,235
That night's party was
especially grand.

425
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:20,035
The heroes of the day
were Okiyo and Shokichi.

426
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:29,349
The workers had deserted.
lt was dead calm.

427
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:37,383
But the next morning...
all the replacements arrived

428
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,928
After all their hard work at
spooking them out,

429
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:44,033
sure enough, new people came
the very next day.

430
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:49,902
A local rumor says the spooks
are only foxes or raccoons.

431
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:57,379
lf that were true, all we'd need to
do is kill the guilty animals.

432
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:01,279
This made the raccoons at
Headquarters very nervous.

433
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:07,116
But this is just like the old tales.
That's how the rumor got started.

434
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,383
That just proves that it's only
a vicious rumor.

435
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,724
Vicious rumor?
We saw it with our own eyes!

436
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:17,297
Very well. We have decided to
exterminate these animals.

437
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:28,406
As soon as we find them,
you'll have your proof.

438
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:38,286
Shokichi wasn't the only one who
was skeptical of their efforts

439
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:39,922
to spook the humans away.

440
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:44,288
As you know, in the Edo era,
the raccoons reigned.

441
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:48,195
The art of metamorphosis
was at its peak

442
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:52,426
lt was a theme of all painters
and writers in that period.

443
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:59,069
But we stood out too much.
The humans were offended.

444
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:05,113
With the progress of civilization,
they captured us by the masses

445
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,150
for the furriers
and the brush makers.

446
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:12,183
This sated their thirst
for vengeance.

447
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:17,893
We have never forgotten this
painful experience.

448
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:22,396
And we have been discrete with
our art in the last few decades,

449
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:26,969
remembering a much more
peaceful period.

450
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:33,038
Metamorphosis is a double-edged
sword. lt is a great gift, but,

451
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:37,442
used carelessly, it will only fan
the flame of humans' hatred.

452
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:39,481
l urge you all to use discretion.

453
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:43,110
The young transforming raccoons
felt like they'd missed the point.

454
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:51,221
But it was autumn,
the time for abundant harvests.

455
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,487
The best season for raccoons.

456
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,627
To prepare for winter, they ate
to store up fat under their fur.

457
00:43:57,001 --> 00:44:00,459
For they must grow their
bushy winter coats.

458
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:21,956
The young ones applied their
skills to the job of getting food.

459
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:29,966
One day, a tired raccoon arrived
at the construction site.

460
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:50,444
lt's O.K., we're raccoons too.

461
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,586
Thank you.

462
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,554
You look awfully tired.
Were did you come from?

463
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,428
From Fujino Mountain.

464
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,669
ls that in Shikoku or Sado?

465
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:09,663
lt's in Kanagawa.
Back over those mountains.

466
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:14,374
Kanagawa? You mean
you're not from Shikoku?

467
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:19,644
Excuse me, it seems you were
expecting something else.

468
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:23,214
lts just that we've been waiting
for somebody.

469
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:27,651
Anyway, did you come
on certain business?

470
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,252
l finally found it!

471
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,653
l was looking for where all the
dirt came from

472
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,462
that made a mess of our mountain.

473
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:37,189
According to this raccoon
named Hayashi,

474
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:40,336
tons of dirt and construction
waste had been unjustly dumped

475
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:42,698
in the hills and valleys of Fujino

476
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,534
polluting the rivers,
causing frequent landslides,

477
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:51,704
and endangering the survival of
the raccoons and other animals.

478
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:54,513
To find the source of this trouble,

479
00:45:54,718 --> 00:46:01,954
Hayashi changed into a human
and sneaked onto an empty truck

480
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:17,701
But his transforming skills were
not perfect. He fell into a trance.

481
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,168
And while the truck carried him
here, he changed back to himself.

482
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,709
lt's not just Fujino,
it's other areas too.

483
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:27,650
The garbage dumpsites, and the
golf courses they keep building.

484
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:32,249
They destroy our mountain here,
and we are troubled.

485
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:37,119
Then they dump the waste on
Fujino. And you are troubled

486
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:40,454
Just how far will they go
with this insanity?

487
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,457
When l arrived here
l was horrified.

488
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:49,468
l thought for sure the waste was
coming from the big city.

489
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,707
But this is a mountain!

490
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:56,111
They dig up one mountain
and dump it on another.

491
00:46:56,513 --> 00:47:00,142
What in the world for?
l don't understand it one bit.

492
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:06,120
Now if we stop the development,
we'll also be doing it for Fujino.

493
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:12,456
l can't express it strongly enough.
l urge you to use your power

494
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:19,125
for the sake of my mountain
as well as your own.

495
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:22,127
Well ...how can we...

496
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:26,042
Where could our messengers
have strayed to?

497
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:37,653
And why haven't they brought the
masters of metamorphosis here?

498
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:46,558
Winter came
without the arrival of the masters.

499
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,528
During their winter rest,

500
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,826
they forgot about the
'New Town Spooks' for a while,

501
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,570
And took a break from
their media campaign.

502
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,708
The media was now busy with
scandals of the singing idols

503
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,540
and crimes of the politicians.

504
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:11,145
ln the garden of our temple

505
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:15,551
Raining, raining cotton candy,
lce cream, snow cone!

506
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:19,286
All our friends, Pom Poko, Pom!

507
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,564
New Year, 33rd year of Pom Poko

508
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,566
New Year's morning brought a
fresh blanket of snow.

509
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:32,636
People were coming home for
the holidays, bringing many gifts,

510
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:38,213
and enjoying long awaited
family gatherings.

511
00:48:54,798 --> 00:49:00,634
Raccoon's golden watch
lt swings but there's no wind.

512
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:08,139
Baby raccoon sees it
And swings his too.

513
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:12,579
-We really saw them.
-A bunch of raccoons pushed it!

514
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,476
lt's the truth!

515
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,877
On New Year's Day, three workers
at the Tama development

516
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,712
were arrested for a destroying a
construction vehicle.

517
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:23,359
The disturbance copycats the
infamous 'New Town Spooks'.

518
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:28,223
lnvestigations are under way,
but the snow has covered...

519
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:30,627
Look what you've done now,
Shokichi.

520
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,833
l don't think we need to worry.

521
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,204
What you did was pointless.

522
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:40,910
Pe was just trying to raise the morale
of those who can't yet transform.

523
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,706
What do you think, Reverend?

524
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,950
l think it'll be all right.

525
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,246
And it was all right.

526
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,382
The 3 workers were released
on insufficient evidence.

527
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:58,551
The raccoons weren't blamed.
The case remained a mystery.

528
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,269
Then spring finally came.

529
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:16,406
Once again, the season for love.

530
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,739
The raccoons, who had been
chaste for over a year,

531
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:22,408
had reached the limits
of their endurance.

532
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:26,952
Love rivalries and
sweet nothings filled the air.

533
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,859
Even the sky was rose-colored.

534
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,925
Wait up, Hanako!

535
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:53,749
-Hanako, wait!
-You can't catch me!

536
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,755
Everyone has spring fever.

537
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:04,551
We're just like trees and flowers.
When spring comes, the sun shines

538
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,925
We bud, our flowers blossom,
then we bear fruit.

539
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:11,858
But we must obey Granny's orders.

540
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:21,405
Until our battle is won,
we will be chaste.

541
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:29,383
Shokichi, you... are really great.
l'm...so glad.

542
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:36,721
-Our love is forever.
-Shokichi

543
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:51,372
That was a big mistake.
Their love grew passionate.

544
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:54,735
And sure enough,
the others had done the same.

545
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:59,371
That spring, Shokichi and Kiyo
had four baby raccoons.

546
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:58,097
Kincho Daimyo Shrine

547
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:04,505
ln late autumn of the year before,
Tamasaburo finally arrived in Awa.

548
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,946
He went to the Kincho Shrine,
home of the wise Masters,

549
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:13,556
to explain the problem in Tokyo,
and ask for the Great One's help.

550
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,156
That's when Tamasaburo fell ill.

551
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,961
But with the care of Koharu,
the Great One's daughter,

552
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,597
he recovered miraculously.

553
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:26,893
That spring the two fell in love
and had three babies.

554
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:35,812
Pnside the shrine, all the Masters of
Shikoku were in a serious meeting.

555
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:39,673
They agreed that it was important
for all of Japan

556
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:47,483
to stop the development in Tokyo.
They must act quickly.

557
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:50,449
But who should be sent?

558
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,423
And who would run the important
affairs here in Shikoku?

559
00:53:54,598 --> 00:54:01,629
Hundreds of questions were raised
but no conclusions were reached

560
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:06,635
Father's in the meeting again today.
Always meetings.

561
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,506
And on such a lovely day.

562
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:16,447
lt's already been 6 months.
When will they reach a decision?

563
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:22,452
l want it to go on forever!

564
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:35,460
l can't stand the thought
of you going back to Tama.

565
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:45,875
Koharu, this kind of happiness
can only be a dream.

566
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:54,247
But why?
Tama, l'm going to ask Father

567
00:54:55,058 --> 00:55:00,121
lf he'll let you stay here
and become his successor.

568
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:16,609
While Tamasaburo was wrapped
up in the anguish of youth,

569
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,773
Bunta, who had journeyed to Sado,
roamed the fields and mountains

570
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:26,048
searching for a Master called
Danzaburo.

571
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:33,089
But he found to trace of him.

572
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:44,936
From summer to autumn, the
raccoons faced a serious dilemma.

573
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:48,710
Not only was their forest
disappearing,

574
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:53,838
but their population multiplied
with the spring baby boom.

575
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:58,816
Bad weather that summer
caused an extreme shortage of food.

576
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:03,752
As expected, persimmons, nuts and
autumn harvests were scarce.

577
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,190
Transforming raccoons managed to
get food from the humans,

578
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:11,232
but it wasn't enough to feed
all the babies.

579
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:27,747
Even the non-transforming
raccoons were forced

580
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:31,853
to go to the humans' homes
to find anything edible.

581
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:36,986
Some of the more careless ones
were hit by cars or caught in traps.

582
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:40,990
Many lives were lost.

583
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,892
l'm back in shape now!

584
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:24,300
lt's time to confront the humans.
Right, Shokichi?

585
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,737
Are you sure you're all right,
Gonta?

586
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,644
Of course! Watch this!

587
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:44,226
This calls for a celebration!
When's the party?

588
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,363
There's no time for a party,
Granny Oroku.

589
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:54,199
l think we should wait until the
Elders get here.

590
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,964
You too, Shokichi?
l'm sick of you wimps.

591
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:02,040
We mustn't forget the strength
of the humans.

592
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:04,769
lf we attack like that,
we're sure to lose.

593
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,916
We've already waited too long!

594
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,984
Hold on.
Let's hear Shokichi's opinion.

595
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:15,414
Until the elders arrive,
l propose three things:

596
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:20,089
First, fair allotment of the food
obtained by transforming raccoons.

597
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,730
ln other words,
a rationing system.

598
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:27,902
Second, enforcement of a
traffic safety program.

599
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:34,305
Third, a rescue squad for anyone
who gets caught in traps.

600
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:40,511
Shokichi, you sound just like a human.

601
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,441
No, l'm very much raccoon.

602
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:51,089
OK we'll worry about the details
later. For now let's see who agrees.

603
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:53,923
All those in favor raise your hands!

604
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,188
Agreed!

605
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,966
What kind of game are you playing,
Gonta?

606
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:01,466
This is not a game! l'm in charge now!

607
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:05,501
Anyone who opposes me will be
killed by my guard troop.

608
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,179
Those are dangerous words, Gonta.

609
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,406
Call him Sir! Gonta, Sir.

610
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:20,254
Humans are strong, indeed.
But if we are desperate enough...

611
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:23,517
We can win. We can kill them.

612
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,253
The saying goes, 'an angry mouse
will eat the cat.'

613
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:30,159
-Cat, schmat!.
-He'll bite his tongue.

614
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,325
We're just cornering ourselves
like mice.

615
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:38,870
Exactly. lf a mouse is cornered, he'll
bite the cat. That's the idea.

616
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:43,240
-We're not mice.
-Biting a cat won't help us.

617
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:48,407
Mice? Yes, a mouse would
taste good right now.

618
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:50,950
Mouse tempura is the best.

619
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:54,518
No, fried mouse nuggets
are the cats pajamas.

620
00:59:54,857 --> 01:00:00,989
-l like'em with breading.
-l like the crispy fried tails.

621
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,833
What are you all doing?

622
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:12,069
As for me...
My favorite is mouse tempura.

623
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:16,172
Listen, Gonta.
This is our level of standards.

624
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:21,179
So we will wait for the elders
from Shikoku.

625
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:24,476
l'm ashamed.

626
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:28,151
And l'm warning you not to have
any more babies.

627
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:31,189
lt's hard enough as it is.

628
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:37,458
No!... lnstead of fewer raccoons,
we need fewer humans!

629
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:42,603
We used to have more territory.
Then along came those pigs!

630
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:46,497
Drive the pigs out! Kill the pigs!

631
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,373
Drive them out! Kill them!

632
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:54,950
Just then...

633
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:46,667
l'll go to inform everyone.

634
01:01:58,247 --> 01:01:59,578
Tamasaburo!

635
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,540
l've brought back the Elders
from Shikoku.

636
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:08,149
Well done, Tamasaburo!

637
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:21,736
Friends, on the way here, we have
seen the devastated mountains.

638
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:25,498
You have our deepest sympathy.

639
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:30,042
We would like to hold a
grand conference tonight.

640
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:33,682
33rd year of Pom Poko. Autumn.

641
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,712
On the arrival of the 3 Elders,
the rally began.

642
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:43,550
There's a big moon out tonight.

643
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:49,156
Everyone, my name is Hage
from Yachima.

644
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:54,300
This year l will be 999 years old.

645
01:02:55,772 --> 01:03:02,143
Why has Shikoku stayed
undeveloped compared to here?

646
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:04,009
Because we have protected
our mountains securely.

647
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:17,416
Our humans know what evil will
befall them if they anger us.

648
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:25,791
We three are worshipped at every
temple and shrine in Shikoku.

649
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:30,802
We are highly respected by humans.

650
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:40,742
l haven't introduced myself.
l am Chief of all of Matsuyama.

651
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:46,487
My name is lnuganu Gyoubu.

652
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:50,387
l'm the Kincho Shrine's 6th
generation chief, Kincho Vl.

653
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:53,187
We shall commence to
eliminate the humans

654
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:57,093
by using your transformation
skills in a 'Spooking War'.

655
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,294
Commanding this battle will require

656
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,836
the concentration of our highest
combined spirit.

657
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:10,208
We 3 could even lose our lives
as sacrifices to this battle.

658
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:15,746
However, if you complete this
operation without error,

659
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:20,384
you will win back the respect
humans once had for you.

660
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:29,825
We must accept the danger

661
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:36,230
and use all our might
to stop the development.

662
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:39,734
We have a full arsenal of tricks.

663
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:46,274
We have built a big solid boat.
One that will carry us far.

664
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:52,846
Come confidently aboard our boat.

665
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:17,268
What a beautiful moon.
We like full moons.

666
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:24,211
This moon is praying for our success.

667
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:27,485
Don't you think so?

668
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:45,865
The raccoons began intense
training for the spooking war.

669
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:05,895
Happy 999th birthday!

670
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:13,265
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

671
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:18,906
Master, will you tell the old story
of Yoichi the archer?

672
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:22,210
Sure, why not.

673
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:10,214
The time is ripe.

674
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:27,270
33rd year of Pom Poko. Year's end.

675
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:29,968
lt was launching day
of the Great Spooking War.

676
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:35,249
Slightly cloudy, no winds,
13 degrees centigrade, humidity 65% .

677
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:38,615
A perfect day for haunting.

678
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:19,725
lt has long been known
that raccoons are highly skilled...

679
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:26,323
at morphing into ghosts.
They're born with this ability.

680
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:29,834
Their task is to bring out
this potential.

681
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:34,570
Just as nature's powers can be
harnessed,

682
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:37,507
accumulating and amplifying
their energy is vital.

683
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:44,582
This was the objective of the
special training by the three Masters.

684
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:49,085
Males, females,
the skilled and unskilled alike.

685
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:53,054
They all participated by
contributing their energy.

686
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:58,592
That evening,
with their united army,

687
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:06,708
they would use their full strength,
as no one had ever seen before.

688
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,682
What's that?

689
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:41,170
Let the dead trees all grow flowers!

690
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:06,516
Wow! A big parade of ghosts!

691
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:13,527
l used to say those sorts of things.
Like a parade of foxes...

692
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:21,225
But you really saw them, right?
With lanterns and all.

693
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:24,865
And the lanterns march along...

694
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:30,135
-l wonder what ever happened?
-Can foxes really do that?

695
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:37,917
lt sure seems so.
But it makes me wonder...

696
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:43,853
lt's probably just my nerves.
All this talk about ghosts...

697
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:54,626
All those old stories about
foxes and lanterns ...

698
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:59,939
lt's all in my head.

699
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:07,215
Make me think l saw them marching.

700
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:12,911
That's what nerves will do...

701
01:13:15,624 --> 01:13:20,994
Of course.
How foolish to even imagine...

702
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:28,360
Human nerves.
They're a frightening thing.

703
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:37,612
One would think there real.
But they can't be real.

704
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:42,945
-But they're real ghosts.
-lt's all nerves, that's all.

705
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:48,248
Hi, honey.

706
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,249
Sachiko!

707
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:42,434
Abira Unken Sowaka!

708
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:54,981
Shikisoku Zeku!

709
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:10,128
Master Gyobu!

710
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:29,050
Aw, is it over already?

711
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:31,309
That was so cool!

712
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:35,853
-Go inside and go to sleep now.
-All right.

713
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:43,123
And be sure to brush your teeth.

714
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:48,593
l feel like l'm in a strange dream.

715
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:51,838
Me too.
What could that have been?

716
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:58,603
-l think maybe it was a U.F.O.
-Strange things do happen.

717
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:07,317
Long ago, when the Matsuyama
Clan was at battle,

718
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:13,225
Gyobu defected to the enemy,
causing the downfall of his clan.

719
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:17,592
He regretted it so deeply,
that he made a solemn vow.

720
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:23,369
He would devote his life
to fighting for justice.

721
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:24,861
Let his death not be wasted.
Let us carry on his noble ideals.

722
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:38,478
We will fight to the end.
Until the Day of Triumph.

723
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:44,926
Raccoons, raccoons
We drink sake, we transform.

724
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:49,186
We will win the Spooking War!
Victory! Victory!

725
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:54,392
ln the heat of their excitement,
nobody was watching the TV.

726
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:59,636
We're looking for any video tape
of this mysterious parade.

727
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:06,005
No one has come forward yet.
lnvestigators are perplexed.

728
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:11,049
l shot all that videotape,
but none of it came out.

729
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,014
This is really weird.

730
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:17,950
The ghost slipped in through here
and it was terrifying!

731
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:21,956
A human could never do that.

732
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:30,204
Something's very fishy here.
l want to move out if l can but...

733
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:34,067
At 12:20 tonight, we will bring
you a special program...

734
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:38,076
with in-depth coverage of this
mysterious event.

735
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:51,288
The investigation goes on and on.

736
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:59,458
But our witnesses recognize
that it was real.

737
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:07,204
They can't blame it on nerves.
They can't explain it away.

738
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:15,247
The humans will be stupefied
by the mystery of the universe.

739
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:19,046
And they'll realize the
insignificance of their existence.

740
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:24,318
Good fortune awaits us.
But let's not wait for it.

741
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:32,364
Let's wake it up. Let's celebrate!
Drink up! Sing! Dance!

742
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:40,269
But the next day,

743
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:43,672
the situation took an unexpected turn.

744
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:48,308
Last night's impromptu parade
in Tama New Town

745
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:52,442
was actually a publicity stunt
for the theme park, Wonderland,

746
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:55,590
which is now under construction.

747
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:59,725
Police have interrogated all
related parties.

748
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:01,221
lmpossible!

749
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:07,561
However, local residents claim
it didn't look like a publicity event.

750
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:09,469
Of course not!

751
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:15,470
The president of Wonderland
confessed to last night's stunt.

752
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,770
What did he say?

753
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:26,286
l would like to apologize to the
public for this disturbance.

754
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:29,087
What is he trying to pull?

755
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:34,421
We are still working on the
construction of Wonderland.

756
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:39,393
But to let everyone know
what a splendid park we're building,

757
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:45,595
we decided to give them all
some free entertainment.

758
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:55,082
As president of the park,
l chose to throw a surprise parade.

759
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,609
-Liar!
-What's he talking about!

760
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:04,223
Fortunately, we've received
enormous public support.

761
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:09,295
We are overwhelmed.

762
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:23,602
lf they must lock me up for this,
l'm prepared to pay the price.

763
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:28,115
-What the...
-Why...

764
01:21:28,683 --> 01:21:30,742
Something is very wrong here!

765
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:35,417
lf they must lock me up for this,
l'm prepared to pay the price.

766
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:36,887
That fool!

767
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:42,330
The news threw the raccoons
into a state of panic.

768
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:47,727
At Wonderland, they searched
for the parade's organizers.

769
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:50,431
l can't do all the work around here!

770
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:54,803
Find whoever was responsible!
l want no stone left unturned!

771
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:59,579
We'll lure them in with money!
As much as it takes!

772
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:01,409
lt was done by raccoons.

773
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:05,451
What? Raccoons?
Then get me a raccoon!

774
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:09,212
Any raccoon!
Contact the raccoon's manager!

775
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:15,727
-Raccoon? What did you say?
-l was only joking.

776
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:20,558
This is no time for jokes.
How did you get in here?

777
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:26,264
Your secretary. l phoned earlier.
My name's Ryutaro.

778
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:31,870
You seem to be in a tight spot.

779
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:37,215
But l happen to be the only man
who can talk to the raccoons for you.

780
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:40,854
l see. l'll give you $ 1 million.

781
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:47,487
While this strange looking man
pursued his scheme,

782
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:51,792
the raccoons were enraged that
that their glory had been stolen.

783
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:59,571
They cried with resentment.
And sunk into helplessness.

784
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:05,908
Since there was no video tape
of the ghost parade,

785
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:10,674
TV coverage tapered off.

786
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:25,260
You're a fox, aren't you?

787
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:36,540
Precisely. l'm Ryutaro,
transforming fox of Tama.

788
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:43,540
l've long heard tales of
the Great Kincho from Awa.

789
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:47,283
l'm honored to be in your presence.

790
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:50,980
l'm just the sixth Kincho.
So tell me, why are you here?

791
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:53,920
l was deeply moved by your
fabulous parade.

792
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:56,523
So you know it was us.

793
01:23:56,798 --> 01:24:01,735
lndeed. And l understand your
despair and discouragement.

794
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:05,272
You really understand?

795
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:14,307
l predicted everything that
happened after the parade.

796
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:15,710
What did you say?

797
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:19,785
Ryutaro the fox invited Kincho
to join him on the Ginza

798
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:24,448
in a special room at a
certain well known club.

799
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:27,523
Please, be my guest!

800
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:31,727
Don't worry, all these ladies
are really foxes.

801
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,971
Would you prefer them like this
or as foxes?

802
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:42,337
...or shall we have them change
to raccoons?

803
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,774
Let's be frank.

804
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:51,451
Raccoons have no future in Tama.
Foxes there have already died.

805
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:55,454
They've perished already?
The foxes?

806
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:59,352
Yes. lt's a pity.
And only a few transforming ones...

807
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:03,327
are surviving by living as humans.

808
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:05,488
As humans?

809
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,827
lt's the only way to survive
in a big city like Tokyo.

810
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:14,542
l brought you here to persuade
you raccoons to do the same.

811
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:16,073
Just a moment!

812
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:19,810
l understand your shock.
But in these pressing times,

813
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:23,475
we must take drastic measures.
There's even more to it than that.

814
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:26,552
lf you swallow poison,
why not drink the whole bottle?

815
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:31,589
The best solution is for you all
to get jobs at Wonderland.

816
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:36,796
What? Work for our enemy?

817
01:25:37,098 --> 01:25:42,365
Let's think calmly. At this point
the raccoons have no choice.

818
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:44,638
That much is given.

819
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:50,036
lt takes money to live as humans
And how can you earn a living?

820
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:52,912
You must use your specialty.

821
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:57,114
How about getting a job
where they pay the most money?

822
01:25:57,919 --> 01:26:01,377
lt's too bad your enemy
is Wonderland.

823
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:04,750
They also pay considerable benefits.

824
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:08,085
This is the monthly salary.

825
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:09,919
And these are the benefits.

826
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:15,625
Of course, no one other than me
will know that you're raccoons.

827
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:20,702
Bon appetite.

828
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:28,581
Think about it over dinner.
Please enjoy the food, Kincho lV.

829
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:32,545
You must be tired of eating
scraps from the Tama garbage.

830
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,185
l don't mind so much.

831
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:36,180
l have one question.

832
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:43,493
lf we must live as humans,
what about those who can't transform?

833
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:45,860
l can't solve everything.

834
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:50,195
At least the strongest ones
will survive.

835
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:55,206
We foxes too had to abandon
our weaker members.

836
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:58,205
Then... they were left to die?

837
01:26:58,513 --> 01:27:01,573
Yes. A heart-wrenching choice.

838
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:06,983
How tragic.

839
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:11,617
lt might ease your mind to note that
unlike foxes,

840
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:15,991
raccoons can eat anything.
They might make it somehow.

841
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:19,830
ln Kincho Vl's absence,

842
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:24,801
the Tama Raccoons were
discussing a counter measure.

843
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,131
Only the core group attended.

844
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:35,015
We have all the arms we need.
We must attack now.

845
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:42,222
lt was a mistake to wait
this long in the first place.

846
01:27:42,824 --> 01:27:47,989
l say, 'Don't sell the pelt
until you've skinned the fox.'

847
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:51,857
Not even Buddha could help us.
We must not blame the elders.

848
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:57,561
Why do the humans all say,
'tricky like a raccoon'?

849
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:01,031
You talk about humans too much,
Shokichi!

850
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:04,907
l'm just trying to learn more
about humans...

851
01:28:05,079 --> 01:28:09,072
Shut up! We must kill all the humans!

852
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,979
Control yourself, Gonta.

853
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:21,059
l think we should tell the humans
that we started the Spooking War.

854
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:27,598
Have you lost your mind ?
That's just what we mustn't do.

855
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:34,066
True. lf they knew it was us,
they'd be on our tails.

856
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:41,004
l'm appalled.
Why must it be kept secret?

857
01:28:41,716 --> 01:28:44,150
l can't accept this.

858
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:50,081
l want to shout it out!
'We are the ones who did it!'

859
01:28:50,591 --> 01:28:55,790
How would we get them to
believe us?

860
01:28:56,197 --> 01:29:03,194
A public declaration. Call the
TV stations, or send letters.

861
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:07,937
They'll probably think
it's a practical joke.

862
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:12,608
Then we'll go on TV and show them
our transformations.

863
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:17,183
They'll say it's a trick
and we'll be humiliated.

864
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:20,914
Look, it's a waste of time arguing.

865
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:22,783
This much was true.

866
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:26,218
The debate went back and forth,
and on into the night.

867
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:31,354
This argument is a waste of time.

868
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:35,860
But if we provoke those terrorists,
they will kill us all.

869
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:38,231
That's why we shouldn't
reveal our secret!

870
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:41,273
lf we reveal ourselves, we're
throwing away our only weapon.

871
01:29:41,676 --> 01:29:44,702
ln this case
we don't have much choice.

872
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:51,815
There's only one thing left
we can do.

873
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:57,787
lnstead of splitting up,
we must combine our strength.

874
01:29:59,627 --> 01:30:03,996
We must launch Spooking War ll.

875
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:08,225
lt might end up the same way.

876
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:12,364
We'll perfect a new plan
and a fresh attitude.

877
01:30:12,774 --> 01:30:16,369
You just don't have the guts
to fight, you stinking girl.

878
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:20,373
Watch what you say! Girls don't stink.

879
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:23,842
lf they did, he'd be one.

880
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:28,078
l intend to start preparations
for Spooking War ll.

881
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,655
And who will follow you?

882
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:33,252
Will anyone follow you ?

883
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:36,162
What do mean by that?

884
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:39,790
Cut it out!

885
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,701
Everyone listen up!

886
01:30:45,072 --> 01:30:49,668
There's only one way
to live in unity.

887
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:54,679
And it requires the
use of your special talents.

888
01:30:55,917 --> 01:31:00,251
Your ability overwhelmed the
humans in the Spooking War.

889
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:05,421
This may sound crazy,
but a non-human can be 'human'.

890
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:09,693
Given this, what should we do?

891
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:16,328
How do you make an egg
stand straight up?

892
01:31:17,872 --> 01:31:21,069
As you know, Columbus did it like this.

893
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:27,713
-Wow! That's great!
-Bravo!

894
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:30,213
ls your plan as great as that?

895
01:31:31,886 --> 01:31:36,448
From now on we will live as
non-human 'humans'.

896
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:39,291
You gotta be joking.

897
01:31:40,061 --> 01:31:42,962
No, this is no joke.

898
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:45,831
But what about the ones
who can't transform?

899
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:47,762
Where's the Reverend?

900
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:51,694
Appeal from all raccoons

901
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:56,136
While the Reverend was gone,

902
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:59,108
they refused to agree to
Kincho Vl's plan.

903
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:03,411
The meeting ended with chaos.
Their unity was destroyed.

904
01:32:05,753 --> 01:32:08,017
They had almost no food left.

905
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:14,818
Hard-driving Gonta went around
recruiting troops for his battle.

906
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:19,263
Master Hage gathered the
non-transforming raccoons...

907
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:23,301
and gave them faith
with a new religious dance.

908
01:32:24,405 --> 01:32:30,139
These are chaotic times.
Our boat has turned to mud.

909
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:34,344
Save us, merciful Buddha.

910
01:32:36,117 --> 01:32:40,110
l hope to grow old like Hage.
So vigorous with old age.

911
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:42,813
Tokyo is such a frightening place.

912
01:32:43,157 --> 01:32:46,285
ln Shikoku, that prayer
would have instant effects.

913
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:53,366
Offerings at our shrine would
double ...no, quadruple!

914
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:59,270
Kincho Vl,
l can't wait any longer.

915
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:03,774
l want to go back to Shikoku
with you! To the Kincho Shrine.

916
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:07,378
Really, Tamasaburo?

917
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:11,852
You've decided to be my successor?

918
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:13,782
Yes, Kincho Vl.

919
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:20,121
l'm relieved to hear that.
But you do this ...

920
01:33:20,294 --> 01:33:27,063
not to abandon your comrades,
but because you love my daughter?

921
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:30,203
Yes, of course. But...

922
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:32,099
But what?

923
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:39,345
No one is following your orders now.
lsn't there anything we can do?

924
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:42,312
Yes, there is something we can do.

925
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:52,491
This is quite a fancy restaurant.

926
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:56,927
We spared no expense to please you.

927
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:09,865
Good job. We'll even beat Disneyland.

928
01:34:31,232 --> 01:34:33,860
To get revenge on the president,

929
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:39,562
Kincho Vl led the raccoons
in apprehending all his money.

930
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:43,636
The president ran to the police

931
01:34:43,944 --> 01:34:46,879
to report the theft of $ l million
by raccoons...

932
01:34:47,048 --> 01:34:49,209
But they didn't believe him.

933
01:34:52,253 --> 01:34:56,212
That same day, Gonta's army
began their operations

934
01:34:56,424 --> 01:34:59,689
to stop the deforestation
of the next mountain.

935
01:35:17,011 --> 01:35:19,104
All of you preservationists.

936
01:35:19,513 --> 01:35:24,280
Leave these woods at once.

937
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:27,554
You are charged with robbery,

938
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:32,715
possession of dangerous weapons
and illegal trespassing.

939
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:41,229
lf you fail to evacuate immediately,
we will use force to remove you.

940
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:59,015
Gonta's troops had the police and
workers fixed to the road.

941
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:01,950
They would not budge an inch.

942
01:36:03,157 --> 01:36:07,423
By nightfall, both sides still
held their positions.

943
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:19,702
lf we can't stop Gonta,
we have no choice but to help him.

944
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:27,614
The riot police are already there.
You're too late.

945
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,188
l'll just go check it out.

946
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:38,721
-Stop! You'll be caught too!
-We're going too!

947
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,063
Everyone ready?

948
01:36:53,174 --> 01:36:58,077
With our spirit of honor,
if we are sacrificed in battle,

949
01:36:58,445 --> 01:37:01,608
our brother raccoons
will continue to fight

950
01:37:01,782 --> 01:37:08,415
with undying determination
until our day of victory.

951
01:37:09,223 --> 01:37:13,387
We raccoons,
with balls of steel

952
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:21,633
swinging in the wind.
Amen.

953
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:24,660
Special mission!

954
01:37:25,105 --> 01:37:27,266
-Wait, Gonta!
-Don't do anything hasty!

955
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:28,339
Let's go!

956
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:46,348
Gonta!

957
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:32,161
They used their tails as weapons
in a brave kamikaze attack.

958
01:38:35,309 --> 01:38:37,869
Mr. Raccoon, Mr. Raccoon.

959
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:40,442
Just then, in another
part of the forest,

960
01:38:40,614 --> 01:38:43,515
a TV reporter was sent to get
an interview with a raccoon.

961
01:38:43,717 --> 01:38:46,345
Won't you please come out?

962
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:49,817
You can transform if you like.
Or stay as you are.

963
01:38:50,224 --> 01:38:56,720
We at ''World Telereporter''
are your fans!

964
01:39:00,501 --> 01:39:03,197
They're not coming out yet.

965
01:39:03,971 --> 01:39:09,534
Mr. Raccoon, can we talk?

966
01:39:10,377 --> 01:39:13,369
We have nothing to eat.

967
01:39:13,847 --> 01:39:17,408
They're responding! The appeal is true!

968
01:39:17,718 --> 01:39:24,180
We would like to know your reasons.
Will you come out?

969
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:27,790
There they are! The raccoons!

970
01:39:28,495 --> 01:39:31,623
Did you really put on the
ghost parade?

971
01:39:32,199 --> 01:39:33,826
Yes, we did.

972
01:39:35,836 --> 01:39:40,671
Won't you show us your fine
transforming talent?

973
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:44,537
So that our viewers will believe you.

974
01:39:44,778 --> 01:39:48,441
There are some raccoons
who can't transform.

975
01:39:48,682 --> 01:39:53,176
This is why we need our forest to live.

976
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:06,323
Listen, raccoons,
you're making my show look bad.

977
01:40:06,567 --> 01:40:15,305
You all have something to say.
So please have some good faith.

978
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:18,201
Reverend!

979
01:40:18,812 --> 01:40:22,839
Please! Tell the humans our demands.

980
01:40:29,890 --> 01:40:35,692
He came out! A real raccoon statue
is walking this way!

981
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:49,036
Mr. Raccoon, please let us
hear your comments.

982
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:52,543
We...
We...

983
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:57,311
Yes,
Please go on.

984
01:41:06,994 --> 01:41:09,656
We are the ones who did it!

985
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:14,899
This forest is our home!
We won't have you taking it away from us

986
01:41:15,402 --> 01:41:15,868
This is the wish of all living things!

987
01:42:00,914 --> 01:42:04,611
The people l saw yesterday
Are gone today.

988
01:42:05,419 --> 01:42:08,547
The people l saw today
Will be gone tomorrow.

989
01:42:09,423 --> 01:42:12,790
Nobody knows about the day after that.

990
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:16,861
But the day will come
when the people will be sorry.

991
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:20,397
The Battle of Yashima,
in the year 1000 AD,

992
01:42:20,601 --> 01:42:23,798
Was seen by the eyes of the
999 year old Hage,

993
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:26,701
respected Master of raccoons.

994
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:31,740
Having seen enough of the world,
He decided to bid farewell.

995
01:42:31,945 --> 01:42:36,382
He took his massive balls,
and stretched them out wide.

996
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:40,543
To make a treasure boat.

997
01:42:43,457 --> 01:42:47,621
He filled it with treasures:
Lacquer, gold, jewels.

998
01:42:47,961 --> 01:42:52,455
Buddha would carry them
from earth to heaven.

999
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:57,097
Cheerfully singing
at the top of their lungs,

1000
01:42:57,471 --> 01:43:02,909
the raccoons embarked merrily
on their journey to heaven.

1001
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:09,942
The treasure boat sailed
along the Tama River,

1002
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:15,679
Floating with the waves.
Rocking and swaying.

1003
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:22,887
The sail filled with wind.
They waited for the tide.

1004
01:43:23,664 --> 01:43:26,599
Waiting for the moon,
the water rippled.

1005
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,395
The treasure boat sailed,
rocking under the moon.

1006
01:43:32,005 --> 01:43:36,408
lt was a dreamlike night.
With bells, flutes and drums.

1007
01:43:36,677 --> 01:43:41,410
Loaded full of raccoons,
full of gold, silver and coral,

1008
01:43:41,648 --> 01:43:45,049
the treasure boat drifted away.

1009
01:43:45,485 --> 01:43:52,220
But before the boat turned to mud,
The other raccoons watched...

1010
01:43:52,693 --> 01:43:56,424
as it entered the mist
like a dream on a night in spring.

1011
01:43:56,697 --> 01:44:03,865
As they looked up at the moon,
Buddha beckoned them to heaven.

1012
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:08,140
And they crossed over
to the other world.

1013
01:44:08,675 --> 01:44:13,135
All the raccoons died.
On the journey of death.

1014
01:44:14,014 --> 01:44:18,508
A journey with no return.
A journey of death.

1015
01:44:18,852 --> 01:44:23,789
Poor raccoons. On the journey of death.

1016
01:44:28,028 --> 01:44:32,124
We're no match for the humans.

1017
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:55,984
Bunta! ls that Bunta?

1018
01:44:59,192 --> 01:45:00,591
Tamasaburo!

1019
01:45:04,531 --> 01:45:08,194
-lt's good to see you back!
-Sasuke! Shokichi!

1020
01:45:09,036 --> 01:45:13,666
What happened to the elder from
Sado? Master Danzaburo?

1021
01:45:14,107 --> 01:45:19,602
Well, after searching all this time,
l found out that 45 years ago,

1022
01:45:19,813 --> 01:45:23,772
he died in the famine after the war.

1023
01:45:24,351 --> 01:45:29,084
l see.
l was hoping to meet him...

1024
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:32,291
Thank you for your efforts, Bunta.

1025
01:45:37,698 --> 01:45:42,658
Tell me what has happened here.
l've been away for three years.

1026
01:45:43,036 --> 01:45:46,233
We've done all sorts of things.

1027
01:45:46,673 --> 01:45:49,836
But everything has changed!
Or am l crazy?

1028
01:45:50,243 --> 01:45:54,270
-l understand your reaction.
-ls this the work of the humans?

1029
01:45:54,715 --> 01:45:57,548
Yes, this is what the humans did.

1030
01:45:57,951 --> 01:46:03,014
lmpossible! Only raccoons could be
this tricky. Not humans!

1031
01:46:04,224 --> 01:46:10,754
The humans have taken over!
They treat us like stinking beggars!

1032
01:46:12,966 --> 01:46:16,800
Give us back our mountains!
Give us back our fields!

1033
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:18,801
Give us back our home!

1034
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:35,847
Shall we give it another try?

1035
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:40,793
One last effort to change this place
back to the way it was?

1036
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:47,326
Why not... We could challenge
the humans with illusions.

1037
01:46:48,268 --> 01:46:52,295
Sounds interesting.
l can see the scenery already.

1038
01:46:52,672 --> 01:46:54,970
Perfect. Our last victory!

1039
01:46:55,976 --> 01:47:01,278
But, what would it prove?
To do something like that now?

1040
01:47:01,848 --> 01:47:04,874
For our amusement...
our amusement.

1041
01:47:06,787 --> 01:47:10,848
A raccoon's not a raccoon
without a playful spirit.

1042
01:47:11,391 --> 01:47:14,121
Will you help us too, Master?

1043
01:47:14,728 --> 01:47:19,392
Of course. lf you don't mind
a little southern flair.

1044
01:47:19,933 --> 01:47:20,865
Ponkichi!

1045
01:47:21,234 --> 01:47:23,998
l'm here! Let's go tell
everyone who's left.

1046
01:47:24,237 --> 01:47:27,365
-Lend me your energy again?
-You can count on me!

1047
01:49:22,355 --> 01:49:25,051
Wait for me, big brother!

1048
01:49:38,838 --> 01:49:41,932
Oh, that looks like Mother.

1049
01:49:43,610 --> 01:49:45,510
lt's Yotchan! Yotchan!

1050
01:50:14,474 --> 01:50:19,036
That's us there!
lt's us when we were little!

1051
01:50:25,986 --> 01:50:29,217
-Hey! Raccoons!
-Oh, cute!

1052
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:34,291
Look Mom, raccoons!

1053
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:38,261
There back again!
Even in a place like this.

1054
01:50:42,135 --> 01:50:44,433
Wait, raccoons!

1055
01:50:48,942 --> 01:50:51,035
Shucks, they left.

1056
01:50:51,244 --> 01:50:57,012
-l wanted to give them some food
-Can raccoons really transform?

1057
01:51:01,688 --> 01:51:03,918
That's how we lost our battle.

1058
01:51:04,257 --> 01:51:08,421
And the New Town development continued.
With no obstacles.

1059
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:15,059
As the days went by,
the new scene grew familiar.

1060
01:51:15,368 --> 01:51:18,337
For humans,
it was a nice place to live.

1061
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:24,634
Trendy new condominiums were built
where the temple once was.

1062
01:51:25,478 --> 01:51:28,572
lt turned out to be a good decision...

1063
01:51:28,948 --> 01:51:33,078
that we revealed ourselves
to the humans that time.

1064
01:51:34,154 --> 01:51:36,315
The result was a community...

1065
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:40,892
that made efforts to live in harmony
with the raccoons.

1066
01:51:41,061 --> 01:51:47,091
They also left the rest of our
trees alone. And made several parks.

1067
01:51:48,968 --> 01:51:54,099
But for us, it was too late.
There wasn't room for us to live.

1068
01:51:54,974 --> 01:52:00,935
Some of us went over the mountain
to live in a town called Machida.

1069
01:52:01,681 --> 01:52:04,650
But there were raccoons there too...

1070
01:52:04,984 --> 01:52:08,044
who suffered because of
suburban development.

1071
01:52:08,221 --> 01:52:12,055
Many were killed on the road.
The days got harder and harder.

1072
01:52:13,093 --> 01:52:17,962
Then, we made the fateful decision.

1073
01:52:30,977 --> 01:52:37,280
That's right. Those of us who can
transform are living as humans.

1074
01:52:37,484 --> 01:52:39,247
Just like the foxes.

1075
01:52:39,519 --> 01:52:43,250
l have a desk job. And my wife, Kiyo,
works at a bar.

1076
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:48,484
Some are working in real estate,
others in forestry.

1077
01:52:48,695 --> 01:52:54,998
But l'm so exhausted with stress.
l want to go back to my forest.

1078
01:52:56,736 --> 01:53:01,435
How can humans endure living like this?

1079
01:53:01,708 --> 01:53:06,475
There are some who drop out
and live in the city streets.

1080
01:53:06,646 --> 01:53:11,606
eating discarded food in the alleys.

1081
01:53:17,557 --> 01:53:21,493
How about Ponkichi and the
other ordinary raccoons?

1082
01:53:47,787 --> 01:53:52,190
'Carefree living' is an expression
made for raccoons.

1083
01:53:53,092 --> 01:53:57,426
They overcome all obstacles,
live happily and freely,

1084
01:53:57,664 --> 01:54:02,294
Make babies with a carefree spirit,
and die.

1085
01:54:42,709 --> 01:54:48,648
There's always someone...
By my side...

1086
01:54:52,185 --> 01:54:53,709
Ponkichi!

1087
01:54:56,623 --> 01:54:58,386
Shokichi!

1088
01:55:01,261 --> 01:55:05,095
-Welcome back!
-You haven't changed a bit!

1089
01:55:05,431 --> 01:55:11,301
There's always sure to be...
Someone by my side.

1090
01:55:12,739 --> 01:55:18,905
Even if you go far away...
From the place you were born,

1091
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:26,182
You'll never be forgotten...
When you return.

1092
01:55:26,653 --> 01:55:30,714
On the TV, they said that
foxes or raccoons,

1093
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:33,415
were 'erasing the scenery
at the development sites.'

1094
01:55:33,593 --> 01:55:35,151
Will you stop saying that?

1095
01:55:35,428 --> 01:55:40,456
lt's true that some raccoons and
foxes probably do those things.

1096
01:55:40,733 --> 01:55:44,567
But how about the
rabbits and weasels?

1097
01:55:44,904 --> 01:55:47,805
Can you erase it yourself?
