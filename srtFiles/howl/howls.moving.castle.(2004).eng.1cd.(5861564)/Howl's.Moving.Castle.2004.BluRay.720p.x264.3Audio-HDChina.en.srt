00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:12,727
HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE

2
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:41,505
Miss Sophie,

3
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:44,050
I've closed up the shop.

4
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:46,677
You should come too, Sophie.

5
00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:49,847
I'll just finish this.
Go have some fun.

6
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:51,932
All right, then, I'm off.

7
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:54,226
I'm going.

8
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:57,313
Look, it's Howl's castle.

9
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:58,898
What? Howl? Where, where?

10
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:00,941
Look how close it is.

11
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:03,027
Oh, no!

12
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:05,154
I wonder if Howl's in town.

13
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:14,246
It took off.

14
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:17,166
No, just hiding
from all the soldiers.

15
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,002
Say, did you hear?
Remember Martha, from South Haven?

16
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:22,296
They say Howl tore her heart out.

17
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:23,214
How scary...

18
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:26,217
Don't worry, he's not going
to want yours.

19
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:28,886
Hurry up.

20
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:32,264
Really?

21
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:34,934
Oh, cut it out...

22
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:37,932
Hey there little mouse,
lost your way?

23
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:40,100
Oh, no... I'm fine.

24
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:43,979
Then how about a cup of tea?
Care to join me?

25
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:48,567
- No thank you, I'm busy
- She sure is a cute little mouse.

26
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:50,861
Say, how old are you?
You live around here?

27
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:52,738
Let me pass!

28
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:56,241
See, it's those whiskers of yours.

29
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,702
She's even cuter when she's mad.

30
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:00,245
Hey, there, I'm sorry.

31
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:02,623
Where've you been?

32
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,668
- Who are you?
- I'm with her.

33
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:08,629
Why don't you two take
a little walk?

34
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:17,471
Don't hold it against them.

35
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:19,890
They're harmless.

36
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:23,185
Where to? I'll be your escort.

37
00:05:23,602 --> 00:05:25,813
No, really,
I'm only going to Cesari's.

38
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:28,524
Act normal.
I'm being followed.

39
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:29,900
Just walk.

40
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:53,048
Sorry, I got you involved.

41
00:05:57,302 --> 00:05:57,886
This way.

42
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:06,478
Hold on.

43
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:14,987
Drop your legs, keep walking.

44
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,786
That's right, don't be frightened.

45
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,761
Very nice.

46
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:56,486
I'll draw them off.

47
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:58,322
Wait here until the coast is clear.

48
00:06:59,031 --> 00:06:59,990
Yes.

49
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:02,159
That's my girl.

50
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:17,716
- Any chocolate Letties?
- Look this way, Lettie.

51
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:19,927
- Hey, make room.
- Let's go for a walk, Lettie.

52
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:20,969
My sister?

53
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:24,431
Come back soon, Lettie.

54
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:29,311
Sophie?

55
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:34,358
How did you land
on the veranda like that?

56
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:37,569
Have you become an angel?
It feels like I'm in a dream...

57
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:39,905
Lettie, why not use the office?

58
00:07:40,113 --> 00:07:43,450
Thanks, but I should really
be working.

59
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:48,205
What?
You sure he wasn't a wizard?

60
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,207
He was so kind...

61
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:53,293
He rescued me...

62
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:56,088
Don't tell me he's stolen your heart.

63
00:07:56,922 --> 00:08:00,801
If that was the wizard Howl,
he'd have eaten it right up.

64
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:04,805
Don't worry,
Howl's only after beauties.

65
00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:06,682
There you go again.

66
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,060
Listen to me,
we live in dangerous times.

67
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:13,063
They say even the Witch of the Waste.
Is back on the prowl.

68
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:16,191
Sophie?

69
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:18,860
Oh, you...

70
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:23,532
Lettie, the Madeleines are done.

71
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:25,867
Okay, be right there.

72
00:08:26,076 --> 00:08:27,285
All right.

73
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:30,706
I'm going home.

74
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:32,958
It's a relief to know
you're doing well.

75
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:36,044
Hello, Lettie.

76
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:37,295
Nice to see you.

77
00:08:37,796 --> 00:08:41,258
Listen, are you going to spend
your whole life in that shop?

78
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:44,970
It meant so much to Papa.

79
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:46,388
Besides, I'm the eldest.

80
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:48,974
That's not what I meant.

81
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:50,600
Are you sure
you want to be a hatter?

82
00:08:51,143 --> 00:08:52,060
Well, I...

83
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,938
- Bye, Lettie!
- Come by the shop next time.

84
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:55,939
Sure.

85
00:08:56,148 --> 00:08:57,107
I'll be on my way.

86
00:08:57,315 --> 00:09:00,986
Sophie, you've got to
look out for yourself.

87
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:11,306
Sorry, the shop's closed.

88
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:13,892
I thought I'd locked the door.

89
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:18,605
What a cheap shop,

90
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:20,899
full of cheap little hats.

91
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,028
And you're
quite cheap-looking yourself.

92
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:29,032
This is just a simple hat shop.

93
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:37,249
I think you had better leave.

94
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,753
You're very brave, taking on
the Witch of the Waste.

95
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,964
The Witch of the Waste?

96
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,933
You won't be able to tell anyone
about that spell.

97
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:57,394
My regards to Howl.

98
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,817
Is this really me!

99
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:48,194
I've got to stay calm.

100
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:06,379
I've got to calm down.

101
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:09,466
It's no use panicking, Sophie.

102
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:13,636
I'll be fine, I'll be fine.

103
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:19,517
I've got to calm down.

104
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:32,322
I'm back!

105
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,324
Welcome home, Ma'am!

106
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:37,535
How do you like it?
It's all the rage in Kingsbury.

107
00:12:37,744 --> 00:12:39,829
- Amazing!
- It suits you.

108
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:43,208
Don't you think it's wonderful?
Sophie!

109
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,920
Mrs. Hatter, Sophie hasn't come down
to work yet

110
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:50,006
I wonder what's the matter?

111
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,093
Sophie!

112
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:02,685
Don't come in!

113
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:05,104
I've got an awful cold!

114
00:13:05,313 --> 00:13:06,856
I don't want you to catch it.

115
00:13:07,815 --> 00:13:09,651
You sound just awful...

116
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:11,736
Like some 90 year-old woman.

117
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:14,614
I'll stay in bed today.

118
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:17,367
You sure? All right, then.

119
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:21,704
Here we go...

120
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:34,676
You'll be fine, old lady.

121
00:13:34,884 --> 00:13:38,972
You're still healthy,
and these clothes finally suit you.

122
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:43,726
But I can't stay here.

123
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:55,905
Ouch, ouch!

124
00:13:56,406 --> 00:13:58,658
It's not easy being old.

125
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:11,421
They're saying this war
is going to be terrible...

126
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,393
Like a hand, granny?

127
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,355
Such a gentleman,
but I'll manage.

128
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:33,151
Sure, old lady,
but where are you off to?

129
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:35,778
Just a bit farther
than where you're going.

130
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:42,577
I don't recommend it, granny.

131
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:45,329
Nothing but witches and wizards ahead.

132
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:47,290
Thank you.

133
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,293
Going to the Folding Valley,
at this hour?

134
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:52,795
Says her youngest sister's there.

135
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,937
I've hardly made any progress at all.

136
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:15,109
Thank goodness
I've still got my teeth.

137
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:24,494
That'll make a good cane.

138
00:15:24,744 --> 00:15:26,621
Up we go.

139
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,171
Might be a bit too thick.

140
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:45,348
Ouch, ouch!

141
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,642
What a stubborn branch.

142
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:52,563
Never underestimate
Grandma Sophie.

143
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:54,398
Heave!

144
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:06,577
A scarecrow, eh?

145
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:09,455
I thought you were
working for the Witch.

146
00:16:09,872 --> 00:16:12,667
But how do you stand by yourself?

147
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:17,380
Your head's a turnip.

148
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:21,133
I've always hated turnips.

149
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:23,844
At least you're not
upside down anymore.

150
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:25,680
So long.

151
00:16:32,937 --> 00:16:34,647
It's so cold.

152
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:37,358
The town's still so close.

153
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:44,323
Don't follow me!

154
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:47,493
You don't owe me a thing.

155
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:49,912
You must be
a magical whatever-you-are.

156
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:52,915
I've had enough of witches and spells!

157
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:56,294
Just go stand wherever you like!

158
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:20,776
This is a perfect cane
Thank you kindly

159
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:25,114
While you're at it, could you bring me
a house to sleep in?

160
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:38,961
Seems you get more cunning with age.

161
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:51,807
What a huge battleship.

162
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:58,564
I never realized how weak you feel
when you get old.

163
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:16,499
I smell smoke.

164
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:19,335
Maybe there's a cabin.

165
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:41,649
Turnip-head, isn't that Howl's Castle?

166
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:45,820
This is hardly what I meant
when I asked for shelter!

167
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:58,332
What is this?

168
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,834
You call this a castle?

169
00:19:20,187 --> 00:19:22,147
Is that the way in?

170
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:26,068
Just wait up there!

171
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:29,905
Hey, there!

172
00:19:31,198 --> 00:19:33,909
Are you going to let me on, or not!

173
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:40,374
My shawl!

174
00:19:53,387 --> 00:19:57,016
It seems warm enough inside, Turnip.
I'm going in.

175
00:19:57,224 --> 00:19:58,309
Thank you.

176
00:19:58,517 --> 00:20:02,313
Even Howl wouldn't want
an ancient heart like mine.

177
00:20:05,232 --> 00:20:06,859
This time, it's really goodbye.

178
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:09,903
You may be a turnip,
but you're a good turnip

179
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:11,989
May you find happiness.

180
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:00,662
What is this place?

181
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:03,373
Just looks like a dilapidated heap.

182
00:21:12,174 --> 00:21:16,637
Well, one nice thing about getting old
is that nothing surprises you anymore

183
00:21:26,355 --> 00:21:28,565
That's some spell you're under.

184
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:32,569
It won't be easy to break.

185
00:21:34,238 --> 00:21:35,572
The fire talked!

186
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:38,075
And you can't even
tell anyone about it.

187
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:40,119
You're Howl?

188
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:44,748
Wrong. I'm the fire demon, Calcifer!

189
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:49,461
Well, then, Calcifer, can you break
the spell I'm under?

190
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:51,255
Easy

191
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:53,882
If you break the spell that chains me
to this place,

192
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:56,510
I'll break your spell in a flash.

193
00:21:57,469 --> 00:22:00,097
In other words, bargain with a demon.

194
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:02,683
You sure you can keep that promise?

195
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,352
Demons don't make promises.

196
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:08,355
I suggest you look elsewhere.

197
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,816
But I'm an exploited demon!

198
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:14,361
I'm chained here by a contract
with Howl, who works me to death.

199
00:22:14,653 --> 00:22:17,614
I'm the one who keeps
this castle moving.

200
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:21,285
My, you've got it rough.

201
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:25,831
If you figure out the secret contract,
the spell will break.

202
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,834
If you do that,
I'll break your spell, too.

203
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:33,380
All right.
A bargain, eh?

204
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,970
Granny!

205
00:22:40,178 --> 00:22:41,555
Granny!

206
00:22:46,268 --> 00:22:48,228
Boy...
I've got my doubts about her.

207
00:23:42,616 --> 00:23:44,159
Hey, who's this?

208
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:45,952
Porthaven!

209
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:48,163
When did she get in?

210
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:56,713
Stand by!

211
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:02,677
Why, Mayor, sir!

212
00:24:02,886 --> 00:24:06,681
The sun is already high.
Is Master Jenkins at home?

213
00:24:07,182 --> 00:24:08,975
The Master is out.

214
00:24:09,184 --> 00:24:11,686
I answer in his stead.

215
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:15,148
An invitation from His Majesty.

216
00:24:15,357 --> 00:24:16,525
It has come to war.

217
00:24:16,983 --> 00:24:19,444
His Majesty desires every wizard

218
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:22,489
and magician, even the witches,
to aid our homeland.

219
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:25,951
His presence is imperative.
That is all.

220
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:30,163
War, how awful.

221
00:24:31,164 --> 00:24:33,041
And who might you be?

222
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,418
Calcifer let me in.

223
00:24:35,627 --> 00:24:38,755
Don't look at me.
She wandered in from the Wastes.

224
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:40,382
The Wastes?

225
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,677
That's strange.
You're not a witch, are you?

226
00:24:44,594 --> 00:24:46,680
A witch could never get in.

227
00:24:47,305 --> 00:24:48,974
Porthaven, again!

228
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:51,393
A customer?

229
00:24:53,353 --> 00:24:54,938
Stand by.

230
00:24:57,816 --> 00:24:59,317
State your purpose.

231
00:24:59,526 --> 00:25:01,069
Mama sent me.

232
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:04,197
The usual spell?

233
00:25:05,657 --> 00:25:07,784
Behave yourself, now.

234
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:26,136
It's not the Wastes.

235
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:29,139
Granny, are you a witch, too?

236
00:25:29,764 --> 00:25:33,894
That's right,
I'm the scariest witch in the land.

237
00:25:34,144 --> 00:25:36,980
Sprinkle this powder on your ship
and the winds will favor it.

238
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:38,273
Sure.

239
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,193
Many thanks.

240
00:25:44,237 --> 00:25:46,489
I can't have you making up things.

241
00:25:46,698 --> 00:25:48,366
You should give up that disguise.

242
00:25:48,575 --> 00:25:51,536
It's not a disguise, it's magic.

243
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:55,040
The Kingsbury door.

244
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:57,667
Stand by.

245
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:06,051
Is this the residence of
Wizard Pendragon?

246
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:07,260
It is, indeed.

247
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:10,597
I bear an invitation
from His Majesty.

248
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:15,018
Please inform Master Pendragon
that he is required at the Palace.

249
00:26:15,977 --> 00:26:18,063
Our thanks to you.

250
00:26:32,744 --> 00:26:35,288
A city fit for a king

251
00:26:35,497 --> 00:26:38,166
Get back in or you'll lose your nose.

252
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:45,548
Stop wandering around!

253
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:24,712
That's enough!
I'm going to get really mad.

254
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:27,757
This is a magic house, isn't it?

255
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:28,758
Oh, boy!

256
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:32,387
- Where does the black one lead?
- Only Master Howl knows.

257
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:35,473
I'm having my breakfast.

258
00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:47,026
But you've got bacon and eggs.

259
00:27:48,027 --> 00:27:51,197
We can't use the fire
when Master Howl's away.

260
00:27:54,784 --> 00:27:56,619
I'll cook for you.

261
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:58,163
But you can't.

262
00:27:58,371 --> 00:28:01,583
Calcifer only obeys Master Howl.

263
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,377
That's right, I won't cook for you.

264
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:07,463
Oh, here's my hat.

265
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:13,428
All right, Calcifer.
Be a good fire, now.

266
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:16,097
Forget it, I'm a demon!

267
00:28:16,306 --> 00:28:18,766
I answer to no one.

268
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,395
You'll do as I say,
or I'll pour water on you.

269
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:25,398
Or would you rather I told Howl
about our bargain?

270
00:28:26,858 --> 00:28:30,737
Hey! Hey! I never should've let
this old lady in.

271
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:32,822
So, what'll it be?

272
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:39,329
That's right, there's a good fire.

273
00:28:41,623 --> 00:28:44,125
Hey! Hey!
I'll burn the bacon.

274
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,711
Calcifer's doing what she says.

275
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,589
I'd like some tea, too.
Have you got a kettle?

276
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:50,882
Sure!

277
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:02,185
Welcome home, Master Howl.

278
00:29:02,393 --> 00:29:04,395
You have letters from the king.

279
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:07,190
To Jenkins and to Pendragon.

280
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:20,787
Calcifer, you're so obedient.

281
00:29:21,287 --> 00:29:22,789
She bullied me.

282
00:29:23,748 --> 00:29:26,167
Not an easy thing to do.

283
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:28,044
Who exactly are you?

284
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:31,214
I'm Grandma Sophie.

285
00:29:31,422 --> 00:29:34,050
You see, I'm your
new cleaning lady.

286
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:35,718
Give me that.

287
00:29:39,806 --> 00:29:42,850
Pass me two more bacon slices
and six more eggs.

288
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,758
And who hired you to clean?

289
00:30:16,592 --> 00:30:18,219
Why, I hired myself.

290
00:30:18,428 --> 00:30:20,680
I've never seen such a filthy house.

291
00:30:22,765 --> 00:30:24,559
Markl, plates.

292
00:30:28,146 --> 00:30:30,523
You're all ganging up on me!

293
00:30:30,815 --> 00:30:32,400
Please join us, Sophie.

294
00:30:37,947 --> 00:30:39,532
Sit over here.

295
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,256
Pick one.

296
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:57,758
Everything else is dirty.

297
00:31:00,845 --> 00:31:02,763
I've got my work cut out for me.

298
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:06,100
Markl.

299
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:07,268
Yes.

300
00:31:08,895 --> 00:31:09,979
Sophie.

301
00:31:10,188 --> 00:31:11,397
Thank you.

302
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:15,484
Brethren, let us partake
of our daily bread.

303
00:31:15,693 --> 00:31:19,155
Our daily bread. Haven't had
a real breakfast in a long while.

304
00:31:26,037 --> 00:31:28,915
So many manners to teach...

305
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:32,752
So, what's that in your pocket?

306
00:31:44,513 --> 00:31:45,514
I wonder what it is.

307
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:46,974
Let me.

308
00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:55,816
It's scorched into the table!
Master Howl, this is...

309
00:31:56,901 --> 00:31:58,402
Ancient sorcery.

310
00:31:58,611 --> 00:31:59,820
And powerful, too.

311
00:32:00,363 --> 00:32:01,656
The Witch of the Waste?

312
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:06,494
"He who catches a falling star,
oh heartless man.

313
00:32:06,702 --> 00:32:08,913
Your heart shall be mine."

314
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:10,414
Well, so much for the tab. Le

315
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,138
Wow, it's gone!

316
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:28,683
The scorch mark has vanished,
but not the spell.

317
00:32:29,392 --> 00:32:31,978
Brethren, continue your meal.

318
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,273
Calcifer, move the castle
100 kilometers.

319
00:32:41,821 --> 00:32:44,907
- And send hot water to the bath.
- Not that, too!

320
00:32:47,493 --> 00:32:49,870
Do you work
for the Witch of the Waste?

321
00:32:51,205 --> 00:32:55,251
Don't be stupid! The witch...

322
00:32:58,713 --> 00:33:01,590
Actually...
the witch... I...

323
00:33:06,762 --> 00:33:09,765
Damn that Witch of the Waste!
Wait 'til I get my hands on her!

324
00:33:09,974 --> 00:33:11,976
Let me finish eating this.

325
00:33:16,147 --> 00:33:19,567
Bugs, you'd better scurry away
or I'll sweep you out!

326
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:24,113
Every last one of you,
mocking me!

327
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:33,122
There's a spell I need.

328
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,290
Later.

329
00:33:34,498 --> 00:33:36,542
A witch rages within.

330
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:44,633
Sophie!

331
00:33:46,677 --> 00:33:49,680
Sophie! I'm going out.

332
00:33:50,681 --> 00:33:52,933
I'll die without some fresh wood!

333
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:55,394
What, what are you doing?

334
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:58,981
I'll fall, I'll fall!
I'm in peril!

335
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,317
I'm sweeping the ashes.

336
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:02,401
Won't be a minute.

337
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,487
I'm in danger!

338
00:34:04,695 --> 00:34:06,238
I'm in danger...

339
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:08,824
I'll go out!

340
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:10,409
Oh, no!

341
00:34:13,496 --> 00:34:16,332
I'm slipping...

342
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:24,632
Hurry, Sophie!

343
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:49,907
Try not to torment my friend.

344
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:57,456
Master Howl, are you going out?

345
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:02,628
Markl, tell our cleaning lady
not to get

346
00:35:02,836 --> 00:35:04,338
too carried away.

347
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:11,011
What'd you do, Sophie?

348
00:35:12,054 --> 00:35:13,514
She abused me!

349
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:16,892
If I die, Howl goes with me.

350
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:18,519
I'm the cleaning lady.

351
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:20,896
It's my job to clean.

352
00:35:22,356 --> 00:35:24,817
No, not the 2nd floor!

353
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:28,320
If I were you, I'd put your
precious things away in a hurry.

354
00:35:29,613 --> 00:35:31,407
Save my room for later.

355
00:35:34,618 --> 00:35:37,705
My little outburst
gave me back my strength.

356
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,669
What a strange house!

357
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,790
Amazing!

358
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:24,084
Calcifer, Calcifer!

359
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:26,378
Are you moving the castle?

360
00:36:26,587 --> 00:36:29,089
What a lot of fuss! Of course I am.

361
00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:30,591
You're incredible, Calcifer!

362
00:36:31,175 --> 00:36:34,219
Your magic's first class.
I misjudged you completely!

363
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:38,348
You think so?

364
00:36:38,557 --> 00:36:40,476
You really think so!

365
00:36:46,982 --> 00:36:49,151
Oh, no, not yet!

366
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:22,684
How beautiful.

367
00:37:22,893 --> 00:37:24,978
It's called Star Lake.

368
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:31,860
Something's stuck in there.

369
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:34,404
Oh, dear.
Lend me a hand, Markl.

370
00:37:34,613 --> 00:37:35,656
Sure.

371
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:42,955
And up!

372
00:37:43,163 --> 00:37:44,623
A scarecrow!

373
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:46,667
He's called Turnip, the Turnip-head.

374
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:49,670
You sure like being upside down.

375
00:37:58,762 --> 00:38:01,056
The odd creature seems to have
taken a liking to me.

376
00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:03,058
He followed me here.

377
00:38:03,267 --> 00:38:05,477
Are you sure
you're not a witch, Sophie?

378
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:09,147
That's right, I'm the cleanest witch
in the land.

379
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,263
Turnip, don't pull it so tight.

380
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,983
Seems like he likes doing the wash.

381
00:38:53,191 --> 00:38:55,444
They'll dry in no time.

382
00:38:57,946 --> 00:39:00,240
Turnip must belong to the demons.

383
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:01,992
Calcifer doesn't seem to mind him.

384
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,120
You're right,
maybe he's a demon of the dead.

385
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:09,916
But he led me
to this wonderful place.

386
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:55,045
I've put away all the laundry, Sophie.

387
00:39:55,295 --> 00:39:58,673
Why, thank you.
We'd better be getting back.

388
00:39:58,882 --> 00:40:00,801
How mysterious,

389
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:04,179
I've never felt such peace.

390
00:41:23,008 --> 00:41:24,134
Stinks!

391
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:26,970
You reek of burnt flesh and steel.

392
00:41:46,781 --> 00:41:49,743
Keep flying and one day you
won't be able to change yourself back.

393
00:41:54,372 --> 00:41:56,833
Isn't it great!
Sophie did this for me.

394
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,880
The fighting is fierce.

395
00:42:02,088 --> 00:42:05,633
The country's ablaze, from the
southern coast to the northern border.

396
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:08,386
I hate the fire in gunpowder.

397
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:11,222
They have no manners

398
00:42:12,515 --> 00:42:15,435
- My own kind attacked me.
- The Witch of the Waste?

399
00:42:15,643 --> 00:42:18,980
Hack wizards masquerading
as monsters.

400
00:42:19,689 --> 00:42:22,567
They'll cry plenty later on,

401
00:42:22,776 --> 00:42:24,819
when they can't regain human form.

402
00:42:25,445 --> 00:42:28,448
No, they'll just forget
they ever knew how to cry.

403
00:42:28,656 --> 00:42:31,242
Aren't you supposed to report
to the king yourself?

404
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:32,702
Yes, well...

405
00:42:32,911 --> 00:42:34,329
Hot water for my bath

406
00:42:34,537 --> 00:42:36,331
Oh, no, not again.

407
00:43:09,405 --> 00:43:10,615
Is that Howl?

408
00:43:10,824 --> 00:43:12,951
Yeah, wasting my hot water again.

409
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:21,209
I'm sure Howl won't eat any breakfast.

410
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:22,293
No matter.

411
00:43:22,502 --> 00:43:24,045
Morning.

412
00:43:27,173 --> 00:43:29,133
It's lovely shopping in the morning.

413
00:43:29,342 --> 00:43:31,094
I've never seen the ocean!

414
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:33,805
Such beautiful, sparkling water!

415
00:43:34,013 --> 00:43:35,932
Same as it always is.

416
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:47,110
I myself hate potatoes.

417
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:48,486
Pay up.

418
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:49,988
Thank you.

419
00:43:50,321 --> 00:43:51,114
Thanks.

420
00:43:53,074 --> 00:43:55,493
Fish, all fresh off the boat.

421
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,414
- That one's tasty.
- I myself hate fish.

422
00:43:59,706 --> 00:44:01,791
The fleet's come home!

423
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,794
- Is that the smoke?
- There's been another battle.

424
00:44:05,044 --> 00:44:06,921
Really? Sorry, lady, later.

425
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:08,673
That ship's on fire!

426
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:33,948
Sophie, let's go get a closer look.

427
00:44:34,157 --> 00:44:37,243
No, I've no stomach for such things.
Let's go home.

428
00:44:38,077 --> 00:44:40,538
Our most advanced battleship,
reduced to this.

429
00:44:45,376 --> 00:44:47,462
Markl, there are Blob Men nearby.

430
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:49,213
Don't move.

431
00:44:49,464 --> 00:44:51,549
They work for the Witch of the Waste.

432
00:44:57,555 --> 00:44:58,598
They're gone.

433
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:01,017
Don't people notice
those terrible monsters?

434
00:45:06,939 --> 00:45:08,649
Look! Up there!

435
00:45:08,983 --> 00:45:10,735
That's what dropped those bombs!

436
00:45:10,943 --> 00:45:12,695
An enemy airship, Sophie!

437
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:20,495
Sophie, flyers!

438
00:45:20,953 --> 00:45:23,831
Ignore the flyers!
They're enemy propaganda!

439
00:45:28,795 --> 00:45:30,046
Are you OK, Sophie?

440
00:45:36,677 --> 00:45:38,346
A glass of water, please

441
00:45:38,554 --> 00:45:39,555
Sure.

442
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:58,199
Sophie, what did you do
to the bathroom shelves? Look!

443
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,285
My hair's turned this weird color!

444
00:46:01,494 --> 00:46:03,204
What... what beautiful hair.

445
00:46:03,412 --> 00:46:04,413
Take a good look!

446
00:46:04,997 --> 00:46:08,042
You mixed up everything on
the shelves and ruined the spells!

447
00:46:09,418 --> 00:46:11,796
I didn't mix up anything,
I simply cleaned up.

448
00:46:12,296 --> 00:46:13,798
Cleaning, always cleaning.

449
00:46:14,006 --> 00:46:17,510
I told you not to get
too carried away!

450
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,011
It's hopeless!

451
00:46:20,138 --> 00:46:22,682
How humiliating.

452
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:25,935
It's not so very bad.

453
00:46:34,193 --> 00:46:36,737
This new shade's quite lovely
in its way.

454
00:46:37,446 --> 00:46:38,364
I'm done for.

455
00:46:38,573 --> 00:46:41,742
What's the point in living,
if you aren't beautiful?

456
00:46:53,588 --> 00:46:56,132
Stop, Howl! Cut it out!

457
00:46:56,716 --> 00:46:58,551
He's calling on
the spirits of Darkness.

458
00:46:58,759 --> 00:47:01,679
He did this last time
a girl ditched him.

459
00:47:05,057 --> 00:47:07,101
Please, Howl, that's enough.

460
00:47:07,894 --> 00:47:11,022
You can just dye your hair again.

461
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:23,993
I've had enough of you, Howl!

462
00:47:24,201 --> 00:47:27,038
I've never once been beautiful!

463
00:47:28,914 --> 00:47:30,625
I've had enough of this place!

464
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:13,834
Thank you, Turnip
You're a kind scarecrow

465
00:48:14,043 --> 00:48:16,754
Please come back, Sophie.
Howl's in trouble!

466
00:48:17,338 --> 00:48:20,341
Cut it out, Howl!
I'm going out!

467
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,760
Sophie!

468
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:25,221
Get over here!

469
00:48:27,598 --> 00:48:28,724
My, he's dramatic.

470
00:48:28,933 --> 00:48:30,017
Is he dead?

471
00:48:30,226 --> 00:48:33,229
Don't worry.
A tantrum never killed anyone.

472
00:48:33,437 --> 00:48:35,064
Help me, Markl.

473
00:48:39,443 --> 00:48:41,570
Get that hot water running, Markl!

474
00:48:42,029 --> 00:48:44,698
C'mon, you can still walk.

475
00:48:56,168 --> 00:48:58,045
You look after him now, Markl.

476
00:48:58,254 --> 00:48:59,296
Sure.

477
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:02,800
I'll have to clean all over again.

478
00:49:26,115 --> 00:49:27,658
I'm coming in.

479
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:38,627
Here's some hot milk.
Drink up.

480
00:49:41,881 --> 00:49:45,593
I'll leave it here.
Drink it while it's hot.

481
00:49:49,346 --> 00:49:51,098
Don't leave me, Sophie.

482
00:49:59,231 --> 00:50:00,774
Try a little milk?

483
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,954
The Witch of the Waste
is searching for my house.

484
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:18,709
You're right, I saw her cronies
down at the port.

485
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:21,962
The truth is, I'm a coward.

486
00:50:22,171 --> 00:50:25,674
All this junk is just sorcery
to keep her away.

487
00:50:25,883 --> 00:50:27,468
I'm scared to death.

488
00:50:29,261 --> 00:50:32,473
Tell me, why is
the Witch of the Waste after you?

489
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:37,353
She seemed quite interesting,
so I approached her.

490
00:50:37,561 --> 00:50:40,981
But she terrified me
and I ran away.

491
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:47,196
Now the king's ordered me
to report to him.

492
00:50:47,404 --> 00:50:49,782
As Jenkins and as Pendragon...

493
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:52,409
How many names do you use, Howl?

494
00:50:52,618 --> 00:50:54,912
Enough to guarantee my freedom.

495
00:50:56,288 --> 00:50:58,499
Can't you refuse the king?

496
00:50:58,707 --> 00:50:59,833
See that...

497
00:51:00,584 --> 00:51:04,546
The oath I took at
the Sorcery Academy.

498
00:51:06,965 --> 00:51:09,426
Say, Howl.
Why not visit the king?

499
00:51:09,927 --> 00:51:11,136
What!

500
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:13,430
Just say it to his face.

501
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:17,267
"Stop this foolish war
I refuse to help you."

502
00:51:19,812 --> 00:51:22,189
Sophie, you don't know
what they're like.

503
00:51:22,981 --> 00:51:23,941
But he's the king, right?

504
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:27,361
A king thinks only
of what's best for his people.

505
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:29,696
I know!

506
00:51:29,988 --> 00:51:32,116
You'll go in my place, Sophie!

507
00:51:34,201 --> 00:51:36,703
Pretend you're Pendragon's mother.

508
00:51:36,954 --> 00:51:40,124
Just tell him your son is
an idle good-for-nothing.

509
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:43,127
Maybe Madam Suliman
will even give up on me.

510
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,504
Madam Suliman?

511
00:51:48,924 --> 00:51:50,634
You're wearing that hat?

512
00:51:50,926 --> 00:51:53,137
After all the magic I spent
making your dress pretty...

513
00:51:53,345 --> 00:51:54,304
Off I go.

514
00:51:54,513 --> 00:51:55,556
Sure!

515
00:51:55,889 --> 00:51:57,724
See you later!

516
00:52:05,941 --> 00:52:08,318
This charm
assures your safe return.

517
00:52:10,404 --> 00:52:13,240
Don't worry,
I'll follow you in disguise.

518
00:52:13,657 --> 00:52:14,992
There.
Off you go!

519
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:25,836
I'm sure this will never work.

520
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,015
I don't suppose he's following me,
disguised as a crow.

521
00:52:45,063 --> 00:52:47,191
I'm sure Howl would pick
a more dramatic disguise

522
00:52:53,739 --> 00:52:54,865
Not that...

523
00:53:06,668 --> 00:53:09,254
The Palace is so far away.

524
00:53:51,129 --> 00:53:54,091
Howl?
Don't tell me you're Howl.

525
00:54:00,138 --> 00:54:02,933
Disguising yourself as an old dog,
of all things.

526
00:54:03,141 --> 00:54:05,268
Do you know how exhausting
it is to be old?

527
00:54:08,647 --> 00:54:11,692
How nice to see you.
The little hatter, right?

528
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:13,652
The Witch of the Waste!

529
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,780
Thank you so much for
delivering my note to Howl.

530
00:54:19,449 --> 00:54:21,284
How's Howl doing?

531
00:54:21,743 --> 00:54:23,453
Quite terrified.

532
00:54:23,662 --> 00:54:26,748
Thanks to him,
I've become a cleaning lady.

533
00:54:27,874 --> 00:54:29,626
My, how delightful.

534
00:54:30,669 --> 00:54:33,880
By the way, what brings you
to see the king?

535
00:54:34,089 --> 00:54:37,467
Job hunting.
I'm sick of working for Howl.

536
00:54:37,676 --> 00:54:38,635
And yourself?

537
00:54:39,344 --> 00:54:41,930
The king invited me.

538
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,725
It seems that idiot, Suliman,

539
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:46,643
finally needs my power.

540
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,272
Why don't you break the spell
you put on me?

541
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,232
That's impossible.

542
00:54:52,441 --> 00:54:56,486
My gifts lie in casting spells,
not breaking them.

543
00:54:56,695 --> 00:54:58,947
See you later, then.

544
00:54:59,448 --> 00:55:02,826
Hey, wait a minute!
Just wait!

545
00:55:04,161 --> 00:55:06,663
If you weren't here,
I'd have hit her with my cane.

546
00:55:24,723 --> 00:55:26,016
What's wrong with you?

547
00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:29,728
Madam, vehicles are prohibited
beyond this point.

548
00:55:29,936 --> 00:55:31,354
Please continue on foot.

549
00:55:31,938 --> 00:55:33,356
That Suliman!

550
00:55:33,565 --> 00:55:37,402
Using magic to force me
to climb these stairs.

551
00:55:48,413 --> 00:55:50,790
We'll catch up.
Pay her no mind.

552
00:56:16,024 --> 00:56:18,944
Heavy, why are you so heavy?

553
00:56:28,954 --> 00:56:32,749
You... Hey... Wait.

554
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:34,501
What is it?

555
00:56:34,709 --> 00:56:38,797
Suddenly remembered...
how to break my spell?

556
00:56:39,005 --> 00:56:42,592
I told you...

557
00:56:42,926 --> 00:56:43,760
I don't know how.

558
00:56:44,135 --> 00:56:45,929
Then, start studying up.

559
00:56:50,725 --> 00:56:52,769
I don't get it.

560
00:56:52,978 --> 00:56:56,106
Where does she get all that energy?

561
00:57:04,406 --> 00:57:06,199
I have to put you down.

562
00:57:12,664 --> 00:57:16,292
Why don't you call it a day?
You can't make it.

563
00:57:17,043 --> 00:57:19,170
It's been 50 years now,

564
00:57:19,379 --> 00:57:21,840
since they drove me out of here...

565
00:57:22,215 --> 00:57:24,050
I've been longing

566
00:57:24,259 --> 00:57:26,970
for this day, ever since...

567
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,888
Good luck to you, then.

568
00:57:29,097 --> 00:57:32,225
Still, I'm not nice enough
to help you out.

569
00:57:32,892 --> 00:57:34,394
Come, Howl.

570
00:57:35,687 --> 00:57:37,605
You heartless wench!

571
00:57:37,814 --> 00:57:40,316
Next time I'll turn you feeble, too!

572
00:58:01,379 --> 00:58:03,381
Hurry up!

573
00:58:04,299 --> 00:58:06,426
Madam, follow me.

574
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,763
First, you should help her.

575
00:58:09,971 --> 00:58:12,849
We are forbidden to assist anyone.

576
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:16,186
But the king himself invited her.

577
00:58:16,394 --> 00:58:18,646
Hang in there!

578
00:58:19,564 --> 00:58:21,232
Just a little farther!

579
00:58:22,192 --> 00:58:24,486
And you call yourself a witch?

580
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,530
Who asked you?

581
00:58:30,241 --> 00:58:32,076
You suddenly look older.

582
00:58:33,203 --> 00:58:36,372
Madam Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

583
00:58:37,957 --> 00:58:39,459
Pull yourself together.

584
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:41,961
Isn't this
what you've been waiting for?

585
00:58:45,215 --> 00:58:48,468
Madam Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

586
00:58:48,676 --> 00:58:52,722
Pendragon...
That name sounds familiar.

587
00:58:52,931 --> 00:58:56,392
Of course it does.
That was the name of my hat shop.

588
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:57,602
It was?

589
00:58:58,228 --> 00:58:59,979
Please wait here.

590
00:59:06,486 --> 00:59:07,570
A chair!

591
00:59:07,946 --> 00:59:09,739
It's mine!

592
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:23,419
Howl, get back here!

593
00:59:31,636 --> 00:59:33,179
Madam, this way please.

594
01:00:33,614 --> 01:00:35,616
I understand you're Howl's mother.

595
01:00:36,701 --> 01:00:38,619
Yes.
My name is Pendragon.

596
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:41,622
I'm sure you're weary.
Please have a seat.

597
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:43,332
Yes.

598
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:56,637
I am Madam Suliman,
His Majesty's witch.

599
01:01:02,894 --> 01:01:04,145
Um, that dog is...

600
01:01:04,937 --> 01:01:06,397
Ah, you mean Heen?

601
01:01:06,606 --> 01:01:09,984
He does my errands.
I asked him to escort you.

602
01:01:14,363 --> 01:01:16,491
Howl won't join us, then?

603
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:21,120
You see, he sends his mother
to make excuses.

604
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:23,998
I'm sure he'd be utterly useless
to His Majesty.

605
01:01:25,374 --> 01:01:27,835
What a shame.

606
01:01:28,044 --> 01:01:31,172
He was my last apprentice...

607
01:01:32,215 --> 01:01:35,343
A student of such marvelous gifts.

608
01:01:35,593 --> 01:01:39,472
I rejoiced in finally finding
a worthy heir.

609
01:01:41,807 --> 01:01:45,019
But then, a demon stole his heart,

610
01:01:45,228 --> 01:01:47,355
and he abandoned me.

611
01:01:47,563 --> 01:01:51,692
He turned his magic
to purely selfish uses.

612
01:01:53,945 --> 01:01:55,279
Mrs. Pendragon.

613
01:01:55,738 --> 01:01:57,532
That boy is dangerous.

614
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:01,869
His power is too great
for one with no heart.

615
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,041
If he follows that path he'll wind up
like the Witch of the Waste.

616
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,042
Bring her!

617
01:02:14,757 --> 01:02:16,259
What happened?

618
01:02:18,511 --> 01:02:21,430
I just restored her to her real age.

619
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:23,182
All her powers are gone.

620
01:02:23,849 --> 01:02:27,728
Once upon a time,
she was a magnificent witch.

621
01:02:28,354 --> 01:02:31,023
She made a bargain with a demon.

622
01:02:31,232 --> 01:02:34,318
Who consumed her, body and soul,
long, long ago.

623
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:38,322
Our kingdom can no longer afford
to turn a blind eye

624
01:02:38,531 --> 01:02:40,449
to disreputable wizards and witches.

625
01:02:40,658 --> 01:02:44,036
If Howl comes here
to serve the kingdom,

626
01:02:44,245 --> 01:02:46,956
I will teach him how to break
with the demon.

627
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:51,252
If not, I'll strip him of his powers
as I have taken hers.

628
01:02:52,545 --> 01:02:53,421
Now just a minute.

629
01:02:55,214 --> 01:02:58,092
Now I understand why Howl
refused to come here.

630
01:02:58,759 --> 01:03:00,136
Something's not right.

631
01:03:00,344 --> 01:03:03,014
Forcing your aged guests
to climb stairs, dragging them

632
01:03:03,222 --> 01:03:05,933
into strange rooms...
It's like a trap.

633
01:03:06,475 --> 01:03:08,311
You call Howl heartless!

634
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:12,273
Yes, he's selfish and cowardly
and unpredictable.

635
01:03:12,481 --> 01:03:15,985
But he's straight as an arrow.
He only wants to be free.

636
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:19,280
Howl won't turn into an evil monster.

637
01:03:19,488 --> 01:03:22,116
He'll battle the demon on his own.

638
01:03:22,324 --> 01:03:23,993
I believe in him.

639
01:03:24,744 --> 01:03:27,288
Mrs. Pendragon...
You're in love with Howl.

640
01:03:28,289 --> 01:03:31,167
Howl...
Howl's coming?

641
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:34,628
I want Howl's heart, I want it!

642
01:03:34,837 --> 01:03:38,299
That's enough from you.
Howl's not coming.

643
01:03:40,051 --> 01:03:42,011
Howl will most certainly come.

644
01:03:43,054 --> 01:03:45,556
Now, I've found his weakness.

645
01:03:52,354 --> 01:03:53,314
Your Majesty.

646
01:03:53,522 --> 01:03:55,066
As you are.

647
01:03:55,274 --> 01:03:56,650
How are you feeling?

648
01:03:56,859 --> 01:03:58,110
Thank you for asking

649
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:01,530
Meetings bore me.
I flew out for a breather.

650
01:04:02,281 --> 01:04:03,491
How lovely.

651
01:04:03,699 --> 01:04:05,201
These are...?

652
01:04:05,576 --> 01:04:07,828
This is Wizard Howl's mother.

653
01:04:08,037 --> 01:04:09,330
I see.

654
01:04:13,334 --> 01:04:17,671
I appreciate it, but I don't intend
to win any war with magic.

655
01:04:18,547 --> 01:04:21,300
It's true that Suliman's powers
shield our palace from bombs.

656
01:04:21,509 --> 01:04:22,927
But they just fall on
neighboring towns.

657
01:04:23,135 --> 01:04:25,638
That's how magic works.
Right, Suliman?

658
01:04:25,846 --> 01:04:28,307
Such eloquence today, Your Majesty.

659
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:30,518
Suliman!

660
01:04:30,893 --> 01:04:32,228
This is the final battle.
This time, we'll beat them to a pulp.

661
01:04:35,397 --> 01:04:39,235
Suliman, you've outdone yourself
with that double. Await good news.

662
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:46,367
Thank you kindly.

663
01:04:46,575 --> 01:04:47,701
Have my generals assembled?

664
01:04:48,577 --> 01:04:50,329
It's been awhile, Howl.

665
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:57,169
Delighted to see you doing so well.

666
01:04:57,378 --> 01:04:59,380
I saw right through you.

667
01:04:59,588 --> 01:05:01,674
Not a very clever disguise.

668
01:05:01,882 --> 01:05:03,634
I've kept my oath.

669
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:06,303
I've no wish to fight you.

670
01:05:06,762 --> 01:05:08,097
I'll take my mother.

671
01:05:08,389 --> 01:05:10,057
I won't let you go.

672
01:05:31,704 --> 01:05:33,664
Don't look down,
you'll be dragged down.

673
01:05:34,415 --> 01:05:38,210
It's time I showed your mother
what you really are.

674
01:06:32,598 --> 01:06:34,183
Howl, don't! It's a trap!

675
01:06:47,529 --> 01:06:48,614
Hold tight!

676
01:06:56,497 --> 01:06:58,123
Sophie, sit up front.

677
01:06:59,917 --> 01:07:03,796
Oh, no, Sophie,
you brought the whole gang along.

678
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:06,381
Nice doggie.

679
01:07:07,049 --> 01:07:10,094
You're just Suliman's spy.

680
01:07:10,302 --> 01:07:12,930
Oh, well, too late to toss you now.

681
01:07:13,138 --> 01:07:14,515
Sophie, you steer.

682
01:07:14,723 --> 01:07:17,101
What! I can't possibly!

683
01:07:17,309 --> 01:07:18,685
They're after us.

684
01:07:23,816 --> 01:07:27,027
I'll tackle them. Fly straight
to the castle in the Wastes.

685
01:07:27,236 --> 01:07:28,987
What! That's impossible!

686
01:07:29,196 --> 01:07:32,157
Don't worry,
the ring will guide you.

687
01:07:32,366 --> 01:07:34,535
Summon Calcifer with your heart.

688
01:07:34,743 --> 01:07:36,203
Summon Calcifer?

689
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:40,666
It's glowing!

690
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:45,045
Follow the light.
You'll be there by nightfall.

691
01:07:45,254 --> 01:07:48,674
Why send me to Suliman
if you were coming yourself?

692
01:07:48,882 --> 01:07:51,343
Your presence gave me
the courage for it.

693
01:07:51,552 --> 01:07:53,720
She's too terrible to
face on my own.

694
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:58,392
You've saved me.
I was in grave danger back there.

695
01:08:00,435 --> 01:08:01,895
Don't let go!

696
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:10,153
- You're good
- Stop joking!

697
01:08:12,781 --> 01:08:14,408
We've got a lead now.

698
01:08:14,825 --> 01:08:17,494
I can give you 5 minutes of
invisibility, now's your chance.

699
01:08:21,206 --> 01:08:22,499
Howl!

700
01:08:34,803 --> 01:08:36,638
No, thank you.

701
01:08:37,139 --> 01:08:40,517
Thank you. That's the most fun
I've had in ages.

702
01:08:41,101 --> 01:08:44,021
I supposed Howl thinks
he's escaped...

703
01:08:44,438 --> 01:08:47,065
His mother's awfully young.

704
01:09:38,033 --> 01:09:40,160
We're not far.
That's my hometown.

705
01:09:43,997 --> 01:09:47,000
Don't look so friendly.
I don't trust you.

706
01:10:11,191 --> 01:10:13,026
The castle.
They've come to meet us!

707
01:10:17,906 --> 01:10:20,033
Sophie!

708
01:10:20,492 --> 01:10:22,035
Markl, help!

709
01:10:22,244 --> 01:10:24,037
I don't know how to stop this thing!

710
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:37,926
Sophie!

711
01:10:38,927 --> 01:10:40,387
Doggie.

712
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:43,348
Markl!

713
01:10:44,432 --> 01:10:45,600
I'm home.

714
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:47,936
Sophie, are you hurt?

715
01:10:49,104 --> 01:10:50,147
You're home!

716
01:10:50,355 --> 01:10:53,066
Thank you for coming to meet us.

717
01:11:24,014 --> 01:11:26,141
Oh, no, you've gone too far.

718
01:11:44,951 --> 01:11:46,911
I wonder if Howl's back.

719
01:12:41,466 --> 01:12:42,592
Howl?

720
01:13:45,196 --> 01:13:46,739
Howl? Is it you?

721
01:13:50,326 --> 01:13:52,120
Are you hurt? In pain?

722
01:13:53,371 --> 01:13:55,123
Stay away.

723
01:13:55,456 --> 01:13:57,417
I want to help you.

724
01:13:57,625 --> 01:13:59,460
I want to break
the spell you're under.

725
01:14:00,753 --> 01:14:03,965
You can't even break
your own spell!

726
01:14:04,424 --> 01:14:06,467
But I love you!

727
01:14:06,926 --> 01:14:08,720
Too late.

728
01:14:12,932 --> 01:14:14,183
Howl!

729
01:14:27,405 --> 01:14:28,948
Howl must be back.

730
01:14:29,157 --> 01:14:33,494
Sophie, you'd better figure out
how to break my spell quick.

731
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,080
We're both running out of time.

732
01:14:36,456 --> 01:14:39,083
Meaning Howl will turn into
a monster? Is it true?

733
01:14:39,292 --> 01:14:41,377
I can't tell you that.

734
01:14:41,586 --> 01:14:42,712
I'm a demon.

735
01:14:44,672 --> 01:14:46,925
Calcifer, Suliman told me,

736
01:14:47,133 --> 01:14:49,969
Howl has given you
something very precious.

737
01:14:50,178 --> 01:14:52,096
What is it?
Where is it?

738
01:14:52,305 --> 01:14:54,933
That's confidential information.

739
01:14:55,141 --> 01:14:57,602
And if I threaten
to dump water over you?

740
01:14:57,810 --> 01:15:00,355
How dare you!
Howl will die with me!

741
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:21,834
Good morning, Turnip.

742
01:15:22,043 --> 01:15:23,961
We've got to be brave.

743
01:15:27,298 --> 01:15:29,300
Ready, Sophie!

744
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:32,762
Ok! Open wider, Calcifer!

745
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:36,974
Here goes! Push!

746
01:15:37,183 --> 01:15:38,726
Heave!

747
01:15:46,734 --> 01:15:51,406
I... said... move!

748
01:15:51,656 --> 01:15:52,990
Come on!

749
01:16:14,846 --> 01:16:18,683
They call it a castle, but once
you get inside, it's a junk heap.

750
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:23,229
It's time to eat!

751
01:16:29,735 --> 01:16:31,279
Here, old girl.

752
01:16:32,155 --> 01:16:35,241
But, Sophie
she's the Witch of the Waste.

753
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:36,993
No need to worry.

754
01:16:37,201 --> 01:16:39,203
Why's she staring at me?

755
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:41,747
Such a pretty fire.

756
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:45,543
Howl!

757
01:16:45,751 --> 01:16:46,878
Hello, everyone.

758
01:16:47,086 --> 01:16:50,173
- Welcome home.
- Master Howl, can we keep this puppy?

759
01:16:50,923 --> 01:16:53,801
An old Witch and
Madam Suliman's dog.

760
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:56,179
Why'd you let them in, Calcifer?

761
01:16:56,929 --> 01:16:57,805
Don't look at me!

762
01:16:58,014 --> 01:17:00,433
They blew in with Sophie.

763
01:17:03,436 --> 01:17:05,188
Sophie, always dramatic...

764
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:08,107
So you're Turnip.

765
01:17:10,526 --> 01:17:12,612
You're under quite a spell, too.

766
01:17:13,571 --> 01:17:15,865
Seems everyone in our little family
is complicated...

767
01:17:16,073 --> 01:17:18,075
He's so handsome.

768
01:17:18,784 --> 01:17:21,704
This is a busy day.
We're moving.

769
01:17:22,121 --> 01:17:22,997
Moving?

770
01:17:23,206 --> 01:17:26,209
Oh, good. There aren't any shops,
here in the middle of nowhere.

771
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:30,129
Madam Suliman can track us down
in no time, here.

772
01:17:30,504 --> 01:17:34,467
But you'll have to stay behind.
The magic in your spell's too risky.

773
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,141
All right, that's done.

774
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:45,019
Take it away, Calcifer.

775
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:01,619
Excellent.

776
01:18:01,827 --> 01:18:03,287
Stay right where you are.

777
01:18:06,832 --> 01:18:08,709
Be gentle...

778
01:18:12,213 --> 01:18:13,297
Here goes.

779
01:18:57,883 --> 01:19:00,594
We've moved.
You can get up now.

780
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:05,015
Amazing, Master!
It's so grand!

781
01:19:05,766 --> 01:19:08,394
What a pretty fire.

782
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:23,868
This is...

783
01:19:24,076 --> 01:19:27,496
I added a bathroom.
For our growing family.

784
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:31,292
Sophie, come here!
Sophie!

785
01:19:34,211 --> 01:19:37,089
I added a bedroom, too.
Go in.

786
01:19:47,725 --> 01:19:49,310
This is... why?

787
01:19:49,727 --> 01:19:52,730
I thought it would suit you.
Do you like it?

788
01:19:54,315 --> 01:19:57,568
Yes, it's perfect
for a housekeeper.

789
01:19:57,776 --> 01:20:00,613
I got you new clothes, too.
Open them later. Next.

790
01:20:01,614 --> 01:20:04,200
Sophie! Come here!
Quick!

791
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:06,577
A courtyard!

792
01:20:06,785 --> 01:20:08,204
There's a shop, too.

793
01:20:08,954 --> 01:20:10,539
Let's go, Heen!

794
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:14,418
See that new color on the dial?
There's a new exit.

795
01:20:17,796 --> 01:20:20,466
My gift to you, Sophie.
Step outside.

796
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:47,785
It's my secret garden.

797
01:20:48,494 --> 01:20:49,995
Beautiful.

798
01:20:52,373 --> 01:20:54,625
Did you make it with your magic?

799
01:20:55,042 --> 01:20:57,795
Only a little, to help the flowers.

800
01:21:07,012 --> 01:21:09,473
Thank you, Howl!

801
01:21:09,682 --> 01:21:11,016
It's like I'm dreaming.

802
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:35,290
Sophie.

803
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:41,213
How mysterious.
I feel I've been here before.

804
01:21:41,422 --> 01:21:43,298
I could cry with happiness.

805
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:44,717
Come.

806
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:54,184
Look.

807
01:21:59,732 --> 01:22:01,108
A sweet little house!

808
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:03,110
My favorite hideaway.

809
01:22:03,902 --> 01:22:07,489
When I was little I spent
my summers there alone.

810
01:22:09,032 --> 01:22:10,367
Alone?

811
01:22:11,076 --> 01:22:12,453
My Uncle, the Wizard,

812
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:14,705
left it to me in secret.

813
01:22:15,122 --> 01:22:17,583
Make yourself at home there, Sophie.

814
01:22:21,545 --> 01:22:22,379
What's wrong?

815
01:22:23,213 --> 01:22:24,214
I'm scared.

816
01:22:24,423 --> 01:22:27,259
I'm afraid you'll go off and disappear
somewhere, once I'm inside.

817
01:22:30,095 --> 01:22:32,306
Howl, tell me the truth.

818
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:35,267
I don't mind if you're a monster.

819
01:22:41,064 --> 01:22:44,526
I want to make sure that
you'll all live comfortably.

820
01:22:44,943 --> 01:22:49,031
Why not a flower shop,
with all these flowers?

821
01:22:49,448 --> 01:22:51,742
You'd be good at it, Sophie.

822
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:54,077
And then, you'd go away?

823
01:22:55,996 --> 01:22:58,916
I want to help you, Howl.

824
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:03,045
I'm not beautiful
and I'm only good at cleaning...

825
01:23:03,587 --> 01:23:06,131
Sophie, you are beautiful.

826
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:13,847
The good thing about being old
is that you've so little to lose...

827
01:23:27,653 --> 01:23:29,488
Why's that flying here?

828
01:23:29,696 --> 01:23:30,405
A battleship?

829
01:23:30,614 --> 01:23:31,949
On its way to burn cities and people.

830
01:23:32,532 --> 01:23:35,369
- The enemy's? Ours?
- What difference does it make?

831
01:23:48,382 --> 01:23:49,466
Murderers.

832
01:23:57,182 --> 01:23:59,893
Look at all those bombs.

833
01:24:15,993 --> 01:24:17,119
It stopped.

834
01:24:17,327 --> 01:24:18,829
Did you do that?

835
01:24:19,037 --> 01:24:21,456
I'm just tinkering.
It won't crash.

836
01:24:25,043 --> 01:24:25,836
Howl!

837
01:24:26,211 --> 01:24:28,630
Oops, looks like they're onto us.

838
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:41,435
Madam Suliman's deputies.
Let's go back.

839
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:43,770
Run! Move those legs!

840
01:24:58,035 --> 01:24:59,161
Hurry on in!

841
01:24:59,369 --> 01:25:01,204
No! Don't let go!

842
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:12,174
What happened, Sophie?

843
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:15,093
I've had it with this place!

844
01:25:25,103 --> 01:25:26,897
Good night, Sophie.

845
01:25:27,105 --> 01:25:28,315
Good night.

846
01:25:30,317 --> 01:25:32,569
Don't worry about Master Howl, Sophie.

847
01:25:32,778 --> 01:25:34,738
Sometimes, he's gone for days on end.

848
01:25:35,781 --> 01:25:37,240
Thank you, Markl.

849
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:40,076
- Need the toilet?
- I'm fine.

850
01:25:40,285 --> 01:25:42,204
Good night.

851
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:43,371
You're in love.

852
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:49,628
Sighing away like that.

853
01:26:01,473 --> 01:26:03,141
I thought so.

854
01:26:03,475 --> 01:26:05,769
Were you ever in love?

855
01:26:05,977 --> 01:26:08,730
Of course I was.
I'm still in love.

856
01:26:08,939 --> 01:26:09,856
What?

857
01:26:10,357 --> 01:26:13,568
Men, why ever should we want them...

858
01:26:13,777 --> 01:26:15,862
But a young man's heart
is so delicious!

859
01:26:16,488 --> 01:26:17,864
Unbelievable.

860
01:26:18,448 --> 01:26:20,951
And so adorable, too.

861
01:26:24,371 --> 01:26:27,165
- What is that?
- Air raid siren.

862
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:29,084
Air raid?

863
01:26:30,627 --> 01:26:31,753
It's not for here.

864
01:26:31,962 --> 01:26:34,631
But best not go out tonight.

865
01:26:36,299 --> 01:26:39,386
Suliman's creatures
are searching high and low

866
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:40,679
for our house.

867
01:26:43,807 --> 01:26:47,686
What a good fire,
hiding us so well

868
01:27:23,138 --> 01:27:25,432
Sophie, a stranger got in!

869
01:27:33,148 --> 01:27:33,982
Mother?

870
01:27:34,441 --> 01:27:36,443
Sophie!

871
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:41,698
Where have you been?
I searched for you everywhere!

872
01:27:42,198 --> 01:27:44,701
But, oh, look how you've aged!

873
01:27:45,368 --> 01:27:47,412
It's all my fault!

874
01:27:49,289 --> 01:27:51,791
I'm so sorry, Sophie!

875
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,835
Mother...

876
01:27:56,379 --> 01:27:58,673
I barely recognize the house.

877
01:27:58,882 --> 01:28:00,633
Who is that?

878
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:02,677
Oh, your landlady.

879
01:28:02,886 --> 01:28:05,972
Sophie, I've got a new husband!

880
01:28:06,473 --> 01:28:07,849
He's such a wonderful man.

881
01:28:08,058 --> 01:28:10,810
And he's rich, too!
We can all live together again.

882
01:28:11,227 --> 01:28:13,563
You'll never have to clean again.

883
01:28:14,314 --> 01:28:17,358
But I'm happy here...

884
01:28:17,567 --> 01:28:18,985
Really?

885
01:28:19,194 --> 01:28:20,070
Oops, I forgot!

886
01:28:20,403 --> 01:28:23,031
My car's waiting.
I've got to run.

887
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:30,789
I'm so glad I found you again.

888
01:28:30,997 --> 01:28:32,999
We'll really catch up next time.

889
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:35,335
In the meantime, you take care.

890
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:42,050
A peeping-bug, eh?

891
01:28:42,258 --> 01:28:45,011
The oldest trick in the book, Suliman.

892
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:46,679
All yours, Cal.

893
01:28:56,356 --> 01:28:58,650
May you find happiness, Mother.

894
01:28:58,858 --> 01:29:01,361
Thank you.
You too, Sophie.

895
01:29:05,448 --> 01:29:08,576
I've done what I was told.
Take me back to my husband.

896
01:29:08,785 --> 01:29:11,579
Yes, I'm sure Madam Suliman
will be pleased.

897
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:15,583
Forgive me, Sophie...

898
01:29:19,754 --> 01:29:21,047
Look at all these people.

899
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,051
They're all running away.
The town will be empty.

900
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,428
Do you wish to run, too?

901
01:29:28,555 --> 01:29:30,557
That's what that lady spoke of...

902
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:34,310
So, she did.
I'm glad we made up.

903
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:36,646
Don't go, Sophie!

904
01:29:37,689 --> 01:29:40,900
I love you, Sophie.
Please stay.

905
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:45,238
I love you, too, Markl.
Don't worry, I won't go.

906
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:46,656
Really!

907
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:49,075
Are we a family?

908
01:29:49,325 --> 01:29:51,077
Yes, we're family

909
01:29:51,744 --> 01:29:53,121
Oh, good!

910
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:03,923
I'll never let Suliman
get hold of Howl.

911
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:23,109
But the paper says we won.

912
01:30:23,318 --> 01:30:26,070
Only fools swallow such lies.

913
01:30:27,196 --> 01:30:30,658
How strange.
I can't get Calcifer going.

914
01:30:31,409 --> 01:30:33,119
Grandma, will you stop that?

915
01:30:33,411 --> 01:30:34,912
Such an awful stink.

916
01:30:35,121 --> 01:30:38,041
Why deny an old lady her pleasures.

917
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:40,543
Open the window, Markl

918
01:30:44,464 --> 01:30:46,632
I wouldn't open that now...

919
01:30:48,426 --> 01:30:51,054
In Calcifer's present state,
he can't possibly

920
01:30:51,262 --> 01:30:52,972
keep them out.

921
01:30:55,016 --> 01:30:56,100
Markl!

922
01:31:06,944 --> 01:31:08,237
Close it quick!

923
01:31:14,827 --> 01:31:17,371
Look after Grandma, Markl.
I'll check on the shop.

924
01:31:36,307 --> 01:31:37,892
How dare you, now?

925
01:31:38,101 --> 01:31:40,353
If you've energy to spare,
put out the fires.

926
01:32:04,794 --> 01:32:05,545
Howl!

927
01:32:19,308 --> 01:32:20,726
Dramatic as usual...

928
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:34,907
Howl!

929
01:32:37,243 --> 01:32:38,202
I'm sorry.
I had too many enemies, tonight.

930
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:43,124
Howl, oh, Howl!

931
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:02,226
Master Howl!
Sophie!

932
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:07,940
Calcifer, be strong.

933
01:33:12,778 --> 01:33:16,907
Madam, was that a gift
from Suliman?

934
01:33:17,366 --> 01:33:20,244
That granny fed me something nasty!

935
01:33:21,037 --> 01:33:23,247
Why, if it isn't Howl!

936
01:33:23,998 --> 01:33:27,585
I feel we need a nice long chat.

937
01:33:28,252 --> 01:33:29,670
Likewise, Madam.

938
01:33:29,879 --> 01:33:31,964
But we've no time, now.

939
01:33:32,548 --> 01:33:36,677
How unlike you.
You're not running away.

940
01:33:36,927 --> 01:33:38,512
Until later, then.

941
01:33:39,513 --> 01:33:42,516
Stay here, Sophie.
Calcifer will protect you.

942
01:33:42,725 --> 01:33:44,518
I'll see to things outside.

943
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:47,480
Wait, Howl!

944
01:33:47,688 --> 01:33:50,149
Don't go! Please stay.

945
01:33:50,775 --> 01:33:54,028
Another round of bombs is coming.
Even Calcifer can't stop those.

946
01:33:54,612 --> 01:33:56,364
Let's run away!
Don't fight.

947
01:33:56,906 --> 01:33:59,367
I'm through running away.

948
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:03,162
I've finally found someone
I want to protect...

949
01:34:03,371 --> 01:34:04,497
You.

950
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:10,211
Howl!

951
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:36,255
That's our town.

952
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:42,011
There's Howl.

953
01:35:51,729 --> 01:35:52,479
Howl!

954
01:36:02,573 --> 01:36:04,325
Sophie!
Turnip...

955
01:36:08,329 --> 01:36:09,955
Markl, come inside!

956
01:36:10,331 --> 01:36:13,125
Move? You're nuts.
There's nothing there.

957
01:36:13,459 --> 01:36:16,587
No, as long as we stay here,
Howl will keep fighting.

958
01:36:17,171 --> 01:36:20,382
He's better off a coward.
Grandma, get up.

959
01:36:20,591 --> 01:36:21,967
Going for a stroll?

960
01:36:22,509 --> 01:36:24,345
Suliman will find us, right away!

961
01:36:24,762 --> 01:36:28,057
She already has. At this rate,
Howl will never make it back alive.

962
01:36:28,265 --> 01:36:29,475
Sophie!

963
01:36:29,683 --> 01:36:30,851
The castle's falling apart.

964
01:36:31,143 --> 01:36:33,187
That's all right.
Markl, take Grandma.

965
01:36:33,395 --> 01:36:34,313
Sure.

966
01:36:36,649 --> 01:36:37,983
You, too, hop up now.

967
01:36:38,525 --> 01:36:41,987
I can't! My contract says
I can't leave the fireplace.

968
01:36:42,571 --> 01:36:44,990
If you two can't solve this,
I'll do it for you.

969
01:36:45,366 --> 01:36:46,909
Watch it!

970
01:36:47,368 --> 01:36:49,328
Cut it out! Cut it out!

971
01:36:50,496 --> 01:36:52,539
If I leave,
the house will collapse.

972
01:36:52,748 --> 01:36:53,540
Fine!

973
01:36:57,544 --> 01:36:58,837
We're out.

974
01:36:59,213 --> 01:37:01,006
I'd better go last.

975
01:37:02,257 --> 01:37:05,427
Even I don't know what'll happen...

976
01:37:34,289 --> 01:37:36,500
I told you, it would collapse.

977
01:37:36,708 --> 01:37:37,876
Rain!

978
01:37:40,587 --> 01:37:42,047
Is that heading for town?

979
01:37:42,256 --> 01:37:43,799
Look after Grandma, Markl.

980
01:37:44,007 --> 01:37:45,759
Turnip, find us a way in.

981
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:49,221
Don't worry, Grandma.
I'll take care of you.

982
01:37:52,266 --> 01:37:54,393
Markl, we can get in here.

983
01:38:04,153 --> 01:38:06,738
The roof's leaking.
I'll go out.

984
01:38:07,322 --> 01:38:08,574
Wait here.

985
01:38:08,782 --> 01:38:10,951
It's wet here...

986
01:38:16,832 --> 01:38:18,083
Hurry!

987
01:38:20,294 --> 01:38:21,795
Too damp!

988
01:38:25,591 --> 01:38:27,217
Bring Grandma here, Markl.

989
01:38:27,676 --> 01:38:29,344
The castle's empty.

990
01:38:29,803 --> 01:38:33,348
I told you, if we'd stayed put,
Howl and I could've handled it.

991
01:38:35,475 --> 01:38:38,103
Calcifer, please.
You're my last hope.

992
01:38:38,812 --> 01:38:41,481
I want to go to Howl.
Move the castle.

993
01:38:42,774 --> 01:38:46,194
I know you can do it.
You're so strong.

994
01:38:46,778 --> 01:38:49,990
But there's no chimney here...

995
01:38:50,282 --> 01:38:51,533
And the wood's damp...

996
01:38:52,326 --> 01:38:54,745
As the saying goes,
"The best blaze brightest

997
01:38:54,953 --> 01:38:56,622
in adversity".

998
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:59,458
I've heard that, but...

999
01:38:59,666 --> 01:39:00,709
You really think so?

1000
01:39:00,959 --> 01:39:02,836
You're so pretty, Cal.

1001
01:39:03,045 --> 01:39:04,129
Sit here, Grandma.

1002
01:39:04,755 --> 01:39:07,215
Then, give me something
of yours, Sophie.

1003
01:39:07,549 --> 01:39:08,467
Of mine?

1004
01:39:08,675 --> 01:39:11,094
I can't do it alone.
How about your eyes?

1005
01:39:11,303 --> 01:39:12,387
My eyes?

1006
01:39:12,721 --> 01:39:13,972
This?

1007
01:40:19,579 --> 01:40:22,082
Amazing, Calcifer!
You are the best!

1008
01:40:22,874 --> 01:40:25,419
Imagine what I could do with
your eyes and your heart.

1009
01:40:25,752 --> 01:40:28,547
Heart! You have a heart?

1010
01:40:31,591 --> 01:40:33,051
Oh, my!

1011
01:40:45,605 --> 01:40:47,941
There's Howl.
He's trapped!

1012
01:40:53,447 --> 01:40:55,115
Hurry, Calcifer!

1013
01:40:55,824 --> 01:40:57,242
Don't!

1014
01:40:58,034 --> 01:40:58,952
Grandma!

1015
01:40:59,703 --> 01:41:00,912
Stop it!

1016
01:41:01,872 --> 01:41:03,748
Howl's heart!

1017
01:41:05,083 --> 01:41:06,001
Cut it out!

1018
01:41:15,886 --> 01:41:16,761
Grandma!

1019
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:20,891
It's hot, hot!

1020
01:41:21,433 --> 01:41:22,684
Let go!

1021
01:41:23,226 --> 01:41:24,728
You'll die, Grandma!

1022
01:41:24,936 --> 01:41:26,938
No, it's mine!

1023
01:41:45,332 --> 01:41:46,791
Sophie!

1024
01:41:50,545 --> 01:41:51,671
Sophie!

1025
01:41:52,505 --> 01:41:55,800
She's so mean.
That's mine.

1026
01:42:39,135 --> 01:42:42,597
Oh, no, Heen, look what I've done.
I poured water on Calcifer.

1027
01:42:45,767 --> 01:42:48,520
What if I've killed Howl, too?

1028
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:17,757
It's moving...
Is Howl alive?

1029
01:43:17,966 --> 01:43:19,759
Show me where he is.

1030
01:43:41,531 --> 01:43:43,074
The castle door...

1031
01:45:01,402 --> 01:45:02,362
Heen...

1032
01:45:37,939 --> 01:45:38,773
Howl...

1033
01:45:57,583 --> 01:46:00,003
This must be Howl's childhood...

1034
01:47:19,248 --> 01:47:20,917
Howl!
Calcifer!

1035
01:47:23,169 --> 01:47:26,506
It's Sophie! Wait for me!
I promise I'll come back for you!

1036
01:47:28,216 --> 01:47:30,092
Wait for me in the future!

1037
01:48:03,292 --> 01:48:06,087
I'll walk there.
Heen, I'll walk.

1038
01:48:06,587 --> 01:48:08,089
I can't stop crying.

1039
01:48:32,655 --> 01:48:33,948
Howl.

1040
01:48:40,496 --> 01:48:43,374
I'm sorry I took so long.

1041
01:48:43,666 --> 01:48:46,294
You've been waiting all this time.

1042
01:48:50,965 --> 01:48:53,467
Take me to Calcifer.

1043
01:49:56,572 --> 01:49:57,490
Is he dead?

1044
01:49:57,698 --> 01:49:59,366
No, he's fine.

1045
01:50:03,913 --> 01:50:05,206
Grandma...

1046
01:50:05,414 --> 01:50:08,918
Don't look at me.
I don't have anything.

1047
01:50:09,418 --> 01:50:10,252
Please.

1048
01:50:12,838 --> 01:50:14,215
Grandma.

1049
01:50:17,051 --> 01:50:19,553
You want it that badly?

1050
01:50:19,762 --> 01:50:20,805
Yes.

1051
01:50:21,764 --> 01:50:25,726
Oh, well, in that case...
You'd better take good care of it.

1052
01:50:26,352 --> 01:50:27,645
There.

1053
01:50:28,938 --> 01:50:31,190
Thank you, Grandma.

1054
01:50:47,331 --> 01:50:48,582
Calcifer.

1055
01:50:49,959 --> 01:50:52,586
Sophie...
I'm all worn out.

1056
01:50:52,795 --> 01:50:56,090
If I give Howl's heart back,
will it kill you?

1057
01:50:56,298 --> 01:50:58,676
Probably not, if you do it, Sophie.

1058
01:50:59,552 --> 01:51:03,639
After all, we both survived
the water you dumped on me.

1059
01:51:03,847 --> 01:51:05,266
I'd better try, then.

1060
01:51:08,727 --> 01:51:11,939
It's all warm and fluttery
like a little bird.

1061
01:51:12,147 --> 01:51:14,191
It's still only a child's heart.

1062
01:51:15,317 --> 01:51:18,279
May Calcifer live a thousand years,

1063
01:51:18,487 --> 01:51:21,448
and may Howl recover his heart...

1064
01:51:33,335 --> 01:51:34,211
I'm alive!

1065
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:35,879
I'm free!

1066
01:51:42,553 --> 01:51:44,430
He moved, he's alive!

1067
01:51:48,934 --> 01:51:50,644
You broke Calcifer's spell!

1068
01:52:05,701 --> 01:52:06,493
Turnip!

1069
01:52:19,757 --> 01:52:21,091
Turnip, are you Ok?

1070
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:23,052
I'll get you a new stick, right away.

1071
01:52:25,846 --> 01:52:27,765
Thank you, Turnip.

1072
01:52:35,814 --> 01:52:37,232
Thank you, Sophie.

1073
01:52:38,484 --> 01:52:40,652
I'm a prince from the next kingdom.

1074
01:52:40,861 --> 01:52:42,863
A cruel spell turned me
into a scarecrow.

1075
01:52:43,238 --> 01:52:46,408
A spell that only your beloved's
kiss could break.

1076
01:52:46,617 --> 01:52:48,994
Exactly.
And if Sophie hadn't saved me,

1077
01:52:49,203 --> 01:52:51,121
I would have died.

1078
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:53,832
My, you're good-looking.

1079
01:52:54,041 --> 01:52:56,668
What a racket!
What's the fuss?

1080
01:52:57,669 --> 01:52:59,880
I feel terrible.
Like I'm trapped under a stone.

1081
01:53:00,422 --> 01:53:02,633
Oh, yes, a heart's a heavy burden.

1082
01:53:03,175 --> 01:53:06,553
Oh, Sophie, your hair is
just like starlight.

1083
01:53:07,095 --> 01:53:08,096
It's so beautiful.

1084
01:53:08,305 --> 01:53:10,557
I love you, Howl!
How wonderful!

1085
01:53:12,976 --> 01:53:15,312
So, now you see how Sophie feels.

1086
01:53:15,521 --> 01:53:19,483
You'd best go home and
make them stop this war.

1087
01:53:19,691 --> 01:53:20,901
That's exactly what I shall do.

1088
01:53:21,610 --> 01:53:24,571
When the war is over, I shall return.

1089
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:27,157
"A fickle heart is the only constant
in this world."

1090
01:53:27,991 --> 01:53:30,077
My, you have a way with words

1091
01:53:30,285 --> 01:53:32,579
I'll wait for your return, then

1092
01:53:39,628 --> 01:53:43,090
Why should you
contact me now?

1093
01:53:43,298 --> 01:53:45,092
What on earth have you been up to?

1094
01:53:48,470 --> 01:53:50,639
A happy ending, I see.

1095
01:53:50,889 --> 01:53:52,516
You two-timer.

1096
01:53:59,398 --> 01:54:01,233
Well, there it is.

1097
01:54:01,650 --> 01:54:05,112
Bring the Prime Minister and
the Minister of Defense.

1098
01:54:05,862 --> 01:54:09,366
Let's put an end to this foolish war.

1099
01:54:10,325 --> 01:54:11,785
It's Calcifer!

1100
01:54:12,661 --> 01:54:14,830
You didn't have to come back.

1101
01:54:17,666 --> 01:54:21,003
I really missed you all.
Besides, it looks like rain...

1102
01:54:21,211 --> 01:54:23,213
Thank you, Calcifer.

1103
01:54:39,062 --> 01:54:44,484
<i>Though we slipped apart</i>

1104
01:54:46,069 --> 01:54:51,325
<i>Like sunlight through the leaves</i>

1105
01:54:52,743 --> 01:54:58,165
<i>The promise of love</i>

1106
01:54:59,458 --> 01:55:04,171
<i>Will live on eternally</i>

1107
01:55:06,089 --> 01:55:12,346
<i>Even though I'm alone now</i>

1108
01:55:12,721 --> 01:55:18,268
<i>My tomorrows are boundless</i>

1109
01:55:19,311 --> 01:55:25,525
<i>Like the kindness you showed me</i>

1110
01:55:26,026 --> 01:55:34,534
<i>Hidden in the night</i>

1111
01:55:35,368 --> 01:55:41,208
<i>Somehow I lost you</i>

1112
01:55:42,167 --> 01:55:47,506
<i>Among all my memories</i>

1113
01:55:48,757 --> 01:55:54,554
<i>In a brook's gentle laughter</i>

1114
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:59,684
<i>In the scent of a flower</i>

1115
01:55:59,893 --> 01:56:04,106
<i>In the depth of the sky</i>

1116
01:56:04,898 --> 01:56:12,656
<i>You will live on eternally</i>
