1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This motion picture is set over the
Mediterranean Sea in an age when...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
... seaplanes ruled the waves. It
tells the story of a valiant pig, who...

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
... fought against flying pirates, for
his pride, for his lover, and for his...

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
... fortune. The name of the hero of our
story is "Porco Rosso".

14
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:49,527
PORCO ROSSO

15
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:43,078
Yeah?!

16
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:45,180
Porco Rosso, get going.

17
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,682
"Mamma Aiuto" is on the move.

18
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:48,186
"Mamma Aiuto"?

19
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:50,588
I don't need a cheap job.

20
00:01:51,396 --> 00:01:53,192
A charter ship from Venice was attacked.

21
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:54,996
They are stealing fuel from the ship.

22
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,093
Is that it?

23
00:01:56,902 --> 00:01:58,493
Ah... Well...

24
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:01,394
Girl students on vacation were on board.

25
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,106
It's going to be more costly then you think.

26
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:05,998
I'm going to apply part three
of the contract 14 to this case.

27
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:07,402
And part four, too.

28
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:12,212
Stop...

29
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:15,312
Or I'm going to sink you! Stop!

30
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:17,519
I'm going to be kidnapped, yeah!

31
00:02:17,923 --> 00:02:19,913
- They're pirates, sea pirates!
- It's not "sea pirates", it's "air pirates".

33
00:02:46,852 --> 00:02:50,252
It needs 'overhaul', huh...

34
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:23,782
- Are you bad guys?
- Yeah.

36
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:26,581
- Are we hostages?
- Yeah.

38
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:29,382
- You guys are called air pirates, not?
- You know a lot.

40
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:31,283
It's a skull.

41
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:32,289
Neat, isn't it?

42
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:34,889
Hurry up kids! I'm busy.

43
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,694
Do you want all 15 of them?

44
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:42,096
It's not nice for a girl
to be left behind, don't you think.

45
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,818
I'm late

46
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:04,319
The girls were kidnapped
by air pirates!

47
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,826
Bring the girls back!

48
00:04:07,532 --> 00:04:10,432
They went that way!

48
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,432
No! Not that way!

49
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,144
I know what they are thinking.

50
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:24,742
Because they're poor and stingy...

51
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:27,447
... and want to save on gasoline...

52
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:29,949
... they will change their course
to the nearest island...

53
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,346
... as soon as they're out of sight.

54
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,951
Shit!

55
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,165
Damn it!

56
00:05:00,185 --> 00:05:01,879
This is no good.

57
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:08,185
Here we are.

58
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:23,504
What the heck is this?

59
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:26,103
A sightseeing plane around the islands.

60
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:27,807
A pig!

61
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:29,009
It's a pig!

62
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,814
It's a pig. What a cute pig...

63
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:35,713
You girls could be kidnapped here.
Watch out babes!

64
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,117
Cool! He's cool!!

65
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,833
What a nuisance!

66
00:05:57,742 --> 00:05:59,641
We are flying! Let me see, let me see!

67
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,442
Hey, kids. Don't.

68
00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:03,939
Shut up, shut up, please.

69
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:05,848
Hey, do something, will you?

70
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,047
That's why I asked
if we wanted to take all of them.

71
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:12,653
Ok, just for a little bit.

72
00:06:13,257 --> 00:06:15,249
Coz you are too naughty...

73
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,548
Wow! Wonderful!

74
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:18,060
Hey, look at that!

75
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:19,461
It's a red plane.

76
00:06:20,165 --> 00:06:21,062
Where, where!

77
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:22,762
He is over there, isn't he?

78
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:24,065
Yes!

79
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,463
I'm not going to let you go any further.

80
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:34,076
See, he is coming.

81
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:35,878
That's Porco Rosso!

82
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,070
Hey, I can't see.

83
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:43,978
Holly cow!

84
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:46,086
It stopped.
We are gonna fall.

86
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,891
Not yet!
We have one more engine!

88
00:06:52,197 --> 00:06:53,788
Damn it. What the heck are you doing!

89
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,187
Shoot, shoot him, shoot him down!

90
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,995
Wow! That red plane is cool isn't it?

91
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:04,803
- You can't hit him, can you?
- You're in my way.

93
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:12,814
The morse code!

94
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:15,309
You loose. Listen to me.

95
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,314
Shut up!

96
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,218
There, he is coming! Here!

97
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,221
Get your heads down!

98
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,226
Where, where is he?

99
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:28,923
He must be hiding.

100
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:41,540
Wow. We are sinking.

102
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:43,641
Let's go, let's go! Come!

103
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:46,339
We are not sinking.
This is a plane!

104
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:54,949
Sinking!

105
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,560
Don't! It's dangerous!

106
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:59,553
Stop them.
They are very valuable hostages to us!

107
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:03,456
Don't worry, mister.
We are students at the swimming school.

109
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:06,461
- Oh, no.
- Me too.

110
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,269
Contact from the pig again.

111
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:11,374
I'm going to allow you
to take half of the gold coins.

112
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:14,074
But leave the rest of the coins
and the hostages, behind!

113
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,377
If you don't,
I'm going to kill you all!

114
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:18,879
Says the pig. But...

115
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:19,978
A half of the coins!?

116
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:20,978
Keep your mouth shut!

117
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:24,478
Come on, Pig.
Let's fight!

119
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:31,484
Go to hell!

120
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,392
What?!

121
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:34,688
It's broken.

122
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:37,398
It's over! We surrender!
We surrender!

123
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:47,005
Bye bye, play with us again, will you?

124
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:48,808
Bye bye.

125
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:51,010
Everything is fine, isn't it?
Since we have enough money for repairs

126
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,407
You, idiot. Be greedy!

127
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:03,123
Calm down, calm down, will you.

128
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,423
Don't touch that,
it will get broken.

129
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:12,835
Don't go close to the propeller.

130
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:15,633
Uhm? Pee? Do it around there, will you?

130
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,000
A new triumph for Porco Rosso.

131
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:22,543
Mamma Aiuto's guys
said they couldn't come to see us.

132
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:27,144
Shit! Such a pig became a hero.

133
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:30,143
But, the young fella is an American,
isn't he?

134
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:32,648
If he is...

135
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:35,149
... that's a shame for the pilots
of the Adriatic.

136
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,457
Oh, not at all.

137
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,658
His grandmother is quarter ltalian.

138
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,654
Anyway, we should do something
about the pig.

139
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:45,057
- We have a great deal of trouble.
- But, 10%? That's not fair.

140
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:45,800
Shhh...

141
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:30,272
Here he comes.

142
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:33,075
He sucks. He is a fake.

143
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:34,976
Shhh...

144
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:49,489
Mr. Porco Rosso!

145
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:51,384
I'm a reporter for
the Neptune newspaper.

146
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:53,192
You did another great job,
again.

147
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:56,097
I think "Mamma Aiuto" is not
going to appear again for a while.

148
00:11:56,801 --> 00:12:01,294
People say your estimated amount of bounty
must be over that of the last year...

149
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:04,697
Ouch! Wait. Let me go.

150
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,402
Listen to a song in silence.

151
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:19,913
She is a wonderful lady.

152
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:22,323
Madam Gina of the hotel Adriano...

153
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:24,717
... is very famous among the pilots
through out this country.

154
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:28,530
During her song, even air pirates
and bounty hunters become good guys.

155
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:31,225
Is that plane up front yours?

156
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:36,437
Yeah, it's the plane with the rattle snake
bringing me fame and fortune.

158
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:39,832
The plane beat an ltalian
at the Schneider cup, twice.

159
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:43,043
Not only is it fast,
but it is also and excellent fighter.

160
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:48,240
I heard that a small pig named Porco Rosso
is famous around here.

161
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:51,850
If you make a deal with the air pirates,
watch your tail "cowboy".

162
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:53,956
They are misers and are poor, too.

163
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:56,456
They stink,
for they don't take a shower.

164
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:59,000
Uh uh... I know that.

165
00:12:59,063 --> 00:13:01,559
What!
Come on, you little chicken shit!

168
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:05,660
What's going on tonight?
You're up to no good, aren't you?

169
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,264
He, he, he, he...
Yes ma'am.

170
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:12,267
I'm glad you came,
but don't play war games.

172
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:14,176
We know, Gina.

173
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:17,480
We don't work within 50km
from this establishment.

174
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,873
We are getting along with even that pig.

175
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:23,984
You're good boys.

176
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:25,785
See you later.

177
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:35,595
Whaa, whaa, what are you doing!

178
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,491
Hi, Porco, tell me your story.

179
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:40,001
Next time two of us are alone.

180
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,802
That Mr. America is funny.

181
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:54,914
As soon as he sees me...
"Will you marry me?"

182
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,913
So I told him:
I married three pilots...

183
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,914
the first died in the war,
the second died over the Atlantic Ocean...

184
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:05,320
... and the last one died in Asia.

185
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,130
You got the news?

186
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:13,735
I got it today.

187
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,339
It said the remains were found
in the forest of Bengal.

188
00:14:24,548 --> 00:14:25,743
I have been waiting for three years.

189
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,942
My tears dried up long ago.

190
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:31,553
Good guys always die.

191
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:34,147
For my friend.

192
00:14:35,058 --> 00:14:37,754
Marco, thank you for staying with me
all those years.

193
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:48,969
You are my best friend.

194
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:52,369
The only thing I don't like...

195
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,375
is that you don't want
to take that picture off.

196
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:56,572
Don't break it, you promised me.

197
00:14:57,081 --> 00:15:01,378
That's only picture left
of Marco as a human.

199
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:08,085
How can we break your curse?

200
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:31,408
That American is very talented.

201
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:01,634
I envy you.

202
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:04,136
I wish I would make money like you.

203
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,846
This is the payment for this month.

204
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,046
You've payed off the entire loan
for the airplane.

205
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:14,648
Let's see, how about buying some patriots bond
in devotion to our country?

206
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,549
I'll let the humans do that.

207
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:36,969
Welcome, Mr. Porco Rosso.
This one is ready.

209
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,380
- Give me 60 rounds of ammo as well.
- O.K.

211
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:43,275
This country is busy, isn't it?

212
00:16:43,788 --> 00:16:44,583
Oh, yeah.

213
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:46,587
The government is probably going to change.

214
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,288
If so, people like you will be outlaws.

216
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:53,490
Country and law
don't mean anything to a pig.

217
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,100
You're right, Mr.
So goes for a mole.

218
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:01,695
Is it ok like usual?

219
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:04,604
We have a new supply of an incendiary bomb.

220
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:07,910
Hey, kid. I'm not going to war.

221
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:09,201
See you.

222
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:11,107
Later...

223
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,315
Excuse me, boss.

224
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:16,912
Could you tell me the difference
between a soldier and a bounty hunter?

225
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:20,115
Uhm... You're a scum
if you can't win in war.

226
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:23,117
You're useless and stupid
if you can't make a fortune.

227
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,625
I've never heard of an air pirate
who was deeply in debt.

228
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:29,830
We had nothing to barter with, Captain.

229
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:32,233
We couldn't even pay for the paint.

230
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,729
There's ships up ahead!

231
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:45,645
Why do I have to stay
with such pathetic looking group?

232
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,741
It's due to the pig, Porco Rosso.

233
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:49,441
What's that?

234
00:17:49,854 --> 00:17:51,845
The guys of "Aiuto" don't even
have money for paint.

235
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:53,545
Poor looking boys.

236
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:57,051
Well, we are finally complete.

237
00:17:57,262 --> 00:18:00,261
Hey, is Mr. America around?

238
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:02,362
Yes, he is in the sun.

239
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:04,663
Just like we told.

240
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:14,368
I sighted the target!

241
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:16,368
It's the Queen of the Mediterranean!

242
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:19,179
Are we going to take on such a big ship?

243
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:22,778
That's why we prepared well.
Don't be afraid!

244
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:26,786
My engine is in trouble.
I'm going to back you up. You go first.

245
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,987
You are cunning!
Do as we agreed!

246
00:18:30,894 --> 00:18:33,192
We share cost of repairs
and expenses when we loose, don't we?

247
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:38,190
You, stingy...
Of course we share them!

248
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:39,892
We need to share the bullets too?

249
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:41,894
Altak is the only right candidate
to speak out here!

250
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:44,205
We've just discussed this issue.

251
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,806
- You cunning bitch!
- If we can't share that, I will quit...

253
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,509
Shut up! Calm down!

254
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:57,211
Attention please, attention please.

255
00:18:57,621 --> 00:18:59,417
Air pirates are attacking this ship...

256
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,221
... but there is nothing to worry about.

257
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,027
This ship has excellent fighters.

258
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:08,923
Let me introduce them.

259
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:15,434
No. 1 is the black stallion,
signore Bulkar...

260
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,834
... and No.2 is the seawolf, Visconti.

261
00:19:32,155 --> 00:19:33,452
I didn't know they had fighter protection.

262
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:34,950
How can it be?

263
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,165
It's totally a mess.

264
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:47,665
Come over here, Curtis!
Curtis

266
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:50,771
Pass it to me!

267
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:09,784
This engine finally had it.

268
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:14,987
Looks like I'll have to take it to Milan.

269
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:22,301
... they were shot down...

270
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:24,401
... but they succeeded in escaping
by parachute.

271
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:28,807
The air pirates, who took all the money
and gold away from the ship...

272
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:30,502
... left the following message,

273
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:32,509
"You are next, pig!"

274
00:20:33,717 --> 00:20:35,513
"Come and get it, pig!"

275
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,019
I repeat

276
00:20:38,223 --> 00:20:40,116
You are next, pig!
Come and get it, pig!

278
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:41,621
This crime...

279
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,817
You guys are special kind of trash.

280
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:52,230
I'm sorry, but I'm going on vacation.

281
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:56,733
White sheets...

282
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:59,739
... beautiful ladies.

283
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,943
Don't give out on me yet, Mr. Engine.

284
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:35,271
I don't like this weather.

285
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,970
Well, guess I'll have
to go under the clouds.

286
00:22:33,636 --> 00:22:34,625
Oh, good boy, hang in there.

287
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,740
Yes, you are a good boy, engine.

288
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:55,757
Rosso!

289
00:23:04,268 --> 00:23:06,065
Fight me man to man.

290
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:08,366
I don't have time to play with you.

291
00:23:17,181 --> 00:23:18,078
Don't run away...

292
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:19,675
... or I'm going to tell everybody about it.

293
00:23:20,284 --> 00:23:22,275
See you later, Mr. America, ha ha ha...

294
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:27,582
Shit, I'm out of the clouds.

295
00:23:29,894 --> 00:23:30,988
Damn it.

296
00:23:32,195 --> 00:23:33,184
Gotcha!

297
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:35,296
No, you didn't.

298
00:23:35,398 --> 00:23:36,297
It's broken.

299
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:48,400
I did it!

300
00:23:48,811 --> 00:23:50,211
Now, I'm a celebrity.

301
00:24:08,932 --> 00:24:10,330
They are not going to believe me...

302
00:24:10,733 --> 00:24:11,826
... if I don't bring back any proof.

303
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:14,236
Let's see...

304
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:22,143
Yes!

305
00:24:39,262 --> 00:24:41,663
This cheap, red colored piece.
This is it.

306
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:46,157
This will be a nice gift
for my mom in Alabama.

307
00:25:30,713 --> 00:25:31,806
Please hurry up.

308
00:25:37,421 --> 00:25:38,718
Madam...

309
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:42,719
... madam. Telephone, please.

310
00:25:43,026 --> 00:25:43,821
He is alive after all.

311
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:47,523
Please get the phone at the front desk.

312
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,429
Marco, is this you?

313
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,338
Did you get hurt?
I was about to leave to pick you up.

314
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:04,039
Ok, that's fine.

315
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:07,846
I lost some weight, because I was stranded
on a deserted island.

316
00:26:08,852 --> 00:26:11,548
I'm going to Milan to repair my plane.

317
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:15,445
If that Mr. America stops by your hotel...

318
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,558
...tell him this, please,
"See you again, next time."

319
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:21,355
What? You think of me as a
bulletin board or something?!

320
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:24,659
However I'm worried about you guys,
and pilots like you regard women...

321
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:27,865
... as nails in a landing pier
or something insignificant.

322
00:26:29,772 --> 00:26:33,071
Marco, you're going to end up
as roast pork someday.

323
00:26:33,576 --> 00:26:35,670
I'd hate to witness such a miserable funeral.

324
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,574
A pig that doesn't fly is just an ordinary pig.

325
00:26:39,883 --> 00:26:40,873
Marco, you fool!

326
00:26:54,137 --> 00:26:57,332
Red broken wings.
Porco Rosso, dead or alive?

326
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:38,138
I guessed you would come tonight.

328
00:27:38,442 --> 00:27:39,431
I come to disturb you again!

329
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:44,638
You lost too much this time.
Why don't you just build another one?

330
00:27:45,449 --> 00:27:46,643
I want to keep this one.

331
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:48,849
I know how you feel.

332
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:52,444
Step aside, please.
I need drive into the factory.

333
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,359
Who is that cute girl?

334
00:27:58,961 --> 00:28:00,656
My granddaughter,
who was living in America.

335
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:07,666
Alright, alright, alright.

336
00:28:25,588 --> 00:28:26,681
Nice plane.

337
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,087
It's neat grandpa.

338
00:28:29,092 --> 00:28:30,286
Good design.

339
00:28:30,894 --> 00:28:33,589
There is almost no workers to do the job
like this these days.

340
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:35,194
She doesn't resemble you.

341
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,289
Is she really your granddaughter?

342
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:40,191
Don't touch her!

343
00:28:44,407 --> 00:28:45,602
Fio, I leave this to you.

344
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:47,701
Ok. I'll do it.

345
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:49,903
The opponent is Curtis.

346
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:51,813
I need 15 knots more.

347
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:54,909
Curtis? I've heard of him.

348
00:29:00,523 --> 00:29:01,319
Look at this.

349
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:02,919
This is a Hallvolley, isn't it.

350
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:05,116
Don't ask how I got this.

351
00:29:05,628 --> 00:29:09,622
An Italian plane
which had this engine lost a race...

352
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:11,025
... against Curtis
at the Schneider's cup in 1927.

353
00:29:11,634 --> 00:29:12,932
But it lost due to poor engineering...

354
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:15,030
... not due to this engine.

355
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,034
This is exciting.

356
00:29:18,741 --> 00:29:20,538
Don't tune it up too delicately.

357
00:29:21,144 --> 00:29:22,236
My plane is not for such racing.

358
00:29:23,246 --> 00:29:27,147
An Asian proverb calls this "Preaching
a sermon to Buddha". Did you know that?

359
00:29:31,654 --> 00:29:33,247
Are you going to take all of my money?

360
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:38,759
These days,
rolls of bills aren't worth a damn.

361
00:29:39,162 --> 00:29:40,652
Give me the money in your pocket,

362
00:29:41,064 --> 00:29:42,963
for the propeller, the paint and...

363
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:46,057
That's is for living expenses,
such as a hotel and meals.

364
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:50,070
You can stay here. I'm not going to
charge you much. Meals included.

365
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:55,273
I don't see your sons.
Are they alright?

366
00:29:55,578 --> 00:29:56,978
All three left looking for work.

367
00:29:57,681 --> 00:29:59,079
Then... Who is going to design my plane?

368
00:29:59,782 --> 00:30:00,771
Fio is.

369
00:30:01,284 --> 00:30:03,877
Fio! That's a girl, isn't she.

370
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:08,690
She is young,
but she's got something my sons lack.

371
00:30:12,796 --> 00:30:14,990
Hey, old man.
We've known each other for a long time...

372
00:30:15,699 --> 00:30:17,997
... but I think I'll look
for another repairman this time.

373
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:20,994
Wait.

374
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:29,000
You are nervous because
I'm a woman, aren't you?

375
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:30,309
Or, am I too young to do it?

376
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,403
Both, Miss.

377
00:30:32,816 --> 00:30:34,306
Ok. I agree with you.

378
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,211
Well, can you tell me the first priority
of being a good pilot?

379
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:41,720
Experience?

380
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,025
No, inspiration, I think.

381
00:30:44,627 --> 00:30:47,118
Oh, I'm glad you didn't say experience.

382
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:52,224
Anyway, I heard from grandpa
that you flew at an early age...

383
00:30:52,736 --> 00:30:54,828
... and have been an excellent pilot since then.

384
00:30:55,838 --> 00:30:58,932
That was 1910, when I was 17.

385
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:02,340
17! That's the same age I am now.

386
00:31:03,646 --> 00:31:05,637
I can't quit being a woman...

387
00:31:06,048 --> 00:31:07,846
... but let me do the job, will you?

388
00:31:08,652 --> 00:31:10,346
If I can't do it well, don't pay me.

389
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:12,548
Is it ok, grandpa?

390
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,752
She is my granddaughter, she'll do well.

391
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:18,757
In my case, I was able
to fix engines at the age of 12.

392
00:31:19,362 --> 00:31:21,454
Could you sleep here tonight?
I'll make your bed tomorrow.

393
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:22,560
The breakfast is at 7:00am.

394
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:24,459
You can take a hot shower.
I've left a towel already.

395
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:25,163
Have a good night.

396
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:31,369
You don't have enough money.
But we know each other well...

397
00:31:31,674 --> 00:31:33,575
... so will make the rest a loan.

398
00:32:18,622 --> 00:32:20,613
Goodmorning. Did you sleep well?

399
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:22,016
Did you stay up all night?

400
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:24,025
This is the rough plan.
What do you think?

401
00:32:24,728 --> 00:32:28,128
I want to redesign this wing section,
leaving the plane shape as it is.

402
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:31,426
This will make your plane fly faster.

403
00:32:32,434 --> 00:32:34,231
I'm surprised at the original plan.

404
00:32:34,938 --> 00:32:36,837
The wing was also made of wood.

405
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:39,131
This plane is great.

406
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,635
The designer who designed
this wing must have know the wood very well.

407
00:32:43,747 --> 00:32:44,736
I'm really impressed.

408
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,742
This is the only plane of its kind made...

409
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:50,547
... nobody used it...

410
00:32:51,954 --> 00:32:53,547
... just put in the store room.

411
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:54,954
No wonder!

412
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:57,449
I'm surprised that this radical design...

413
00:32:57,861 --> 00:32:59,259
... allows you to take off from water surface.

414
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,361
Only take offs and
landings give me some difficulty.

415
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,965
It behaves strange during the flight.

416
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:10,162
Add 0.5 degrees to the angle
of the wings, right?

417
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:12,673
Everything should be fine then.

418
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:14,873
You'll let me continue with this,
won't you?

419
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:16,369
Thank you, Mr.! I'll do my best!

420
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:20,672
But let me tell you something, Miss.

421
00:33:22,685 --> 00:33:23,778
Don't stay up all night.

422
00:33:24,186 --> 00:33:25,586
Insomnia prevents
you from doing an excellent job.

423
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:28,189
And it is not good for your beauty.

424
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:30,588
Thank you for your advice.

425
00:33:32,194 --> 00:33:33,183
Well...

426
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:36,997
... to be honest,
I couldn't sleep well last night.

428
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,096
I was worried that
you won't let me do this job.

429
00:33:40,502 --> 00:33:43,098
Well, I'm very sleepy now.
I'll make coffee for you.

431
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:48,500
Is she going to build this plane alone?

432
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,010
Next is my niece, Monica.
She is will be in charge of general construction.

434
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,423
This is a wife of my nephew, Silvana.
She is going to do finishing construction.

436
00:34:02,527 --> 00:34:07,018
These are daughters of my relatives.
Sophia, Laura, Constance, Valentina.

438
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:09,021
This is Fio's elder sister, Giliora.

439
00:34:09,331 --> 00:34:11,322
This is Sandra, my cousin.

440
00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:12,525
You look so pretty Marietta.

441
00:34:13,235 --> 00:34:14,327
Wives of my sons,

442
00:34:14,737 --> 00:34:18,036
Maria, Tina, Anna
and her younger sister Birreta.

444
00:34:18,842 --> 00:34:19,934
Angelino!

445
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:21,434
Grandma!

446
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,340
Are you still alive?

447
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:28,849
You've grown up to be a nice boy!

448
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,849
Are you ladies going to work?

449
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:38,155
Yes, I'd like to have some money
for my great-grandchildren.

450
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:45,362
There are no men here, right?

451
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,869
Ah...

452
00:34:49,271 --> 00:34:50,068
All these are your relatives?

453
00:34:50,472 --> 00:34:51,666
Yes, they don't have any jobs these days.

454
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:54,072
All the men went to other places to work.

455
00:34:56,478 --> 00:34:57,969
Because of the "Great Depression"?

456
00:34:58,882 --> 00:34:59,974
Don't worry.

457
00:35:00,382 --> 00:35:03,382
Girls are nice, they work very well
and are also gutsy.

459
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:06,688
Making an airplane is in no way
like baking a cake, I think...

460
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:17,088
Dear God.

461
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,590
You gave my company,
which was about to go bankrupt...

462
00:35:19,902 --> 00:35:21,597
... a piece of bread and a job.

463
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:26,507
Please forgive us,
who make a fighter plane with ladies.

464
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:28,003
Amen.

465
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:33,610
Well, let's eat well and work hard!

466
00:35:44,126 --> 00:35:47,119
Sounds good!
This engine is quite something!

467
00:35:54,536 --> 00:35:56,333
What do you say, it's nice, isn't it?

468
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,931
Don't over do it
or this factory will be gone.

469
00:36:02,045 --> 00:36:04,445
Huh, you think Curtis is not worth it?

470
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,170
Uh-hm, sure, this is a good idea.

471
00:36:38,481 --> 00:36:40,380
So, let me do it.

472
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:43,675
But, this is going to cost a fortune.

473
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:47,786
I got a lot of bills already.

474
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,590
I'm not sure what our sponsor thinks.

475
00:36:52,394 --> 00:36:53,588
Porco...

476
00:36:55,898 --> 00:36:58,197
Ok, ok. Don't look at me like that.

477
00:36:59,001 --> 00:36:59,990
Do it your way.

478
00:37:00,503 --> 00:37:02,596
Yes! I've already talked to the manufacturers.

479
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:03,802
I will order these immediately.

480
00:37:04,507 --> 00:37:05,996
Porco, I love you!

481
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:12,005
Wait at least three months, will you?

482
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:14,614
I want to change my job
and become an air pirate.

483
00:37:15,418 --> 00:37:16,612
She is a nice girl, isn't she.

484
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:18,713
Don't touch her.

485
00:37:19,422 --> 00:37:21,719
If I would be henpecked,
I could not feel happy.

486
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:38,791
You're a major now?
You rose in the world, Fierrali.

487
00:38:39,202 --> 00:38:40,793
You, fool. Why did you come back?

488
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,804
I make it a rule to go wherever I want to.

489
00:38:44,706 --> 00:38:46,503
The government is not going
to let you go this time.

490
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,804
Did somebody follow you?

491
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:50,201
I gave them the slip.

492
00:38:50,913 --> 00:39:00,117
A warrant for your arrest
is going to be issued.

493
00:39:01,824 --> 00:39:03,222
Hey, this is no time to laugh.

494
00:39:04,726 --> 00:39:07,422
They say they will confiscate your plane.

495
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,521
This movie is crap, don't you think.

496
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:13,333
Hey, Marco, come back to the air force.

497
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:16,327
I would make room for you.

498
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:19,338
I'd rather be a pig than a fascist.

499
00:39:19,842 --> 00:39:21,833
The era of sky adventures is over.

500
00:39:22,244 --> 00:39:25,646
It's the only thing left for us to do.

501
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,246
To fly for such ridiculous reasons
as the country or the nation?

502
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:34,054
You are a pig after all, huh?

503
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:38,358
Thanks for your advice, Fierrali.
Give my regards to the others.

504
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,760
This is a nice film, don't you think.
Watch your tail cowboy.

505
00:39:43,266 --> 00:39:45,563
They don't sue a pigs, but...

506
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,367
Goodbye, my comrade.

507
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:08,981
Porco, need a ride?

508
00:40:14,396 --> 00:40:15,795
Hey, you're a life saver.

509
00:40:22,204 --> 00:40:25,405
I borrowed this because
I need to take your plane to the lake tomorrow.

510
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:26,804
It's for a test flight.

511
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,909
I don't need the test flight.
I need to fly as soon as possible.

512
00:40:31,213 --> 00:40:32,202
Don't be such a fool.

513
00:40:32,614 --> 00:40:34,411
I'm not going to give you the plane
without testing it.

514
00:40:35,217 --> 00:40:38,414
Besides, it will take almost a day
to take it apart and transport it to the lake.

515
00:40:38,721 --> 00:40:39,710
We don't have much time.

516
00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:41,815
Take a look back, will you, slowly.

517
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:46,925
That's the fascists secret police.

518
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,724
They were following you, Fio.

519
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:52,623
Me? Why? For what?

520
00:40:53,436 --> 00:40:55,027
Because I gave them the slip.

521
00:40:55,637 --> 00:40:58,333
And, because you are working on my plane.

522
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:04,445
Porco, are you really a spy?

523
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,951
Ha, ha, ha, ha! l? A spy?
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

524
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:16,251
Look, a secret agent works much harder than l.

525
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:18,956
But, you were a hero during the war.

526
00:41:19,862 --> 00:41:22,159
This is strange if you didn't do anything.

527
00:41:22,465 --> 00:41:24,557
I think so, too.

528
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:30,565
This is not right way!

529
00:41:42,985 --> 00:41:44,976
Looks like you're used to being in big trouble.

530
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:47,978
Well, we will be very busy.

531
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,108
You can fly anytime you want.

532
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:21,021
Two guys are hiding in the backyard,

533
00:42:21,324 --> 00:42:22,518
and three in the front.

534
00:42:23,226 --> 00:42:25,723
This excites me!

535
00:42:25,729 --> 00:42:27,226
Hey, don't ramble.

536
00:42:30,532 --> 00:42:31,226
See you later.

537
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:32,028
Take care of yourself.

538
00:42:44,347 --> 00:42:45,643
Fio! What are you doing?

539
00:42:46,548 --> 00:42:49,244
I'm going, too. Wait for five minutes, please!
I want to prepare my seat.

540
00:42:50,753 --> 00:42:54,347
Give me a break!
Do you understand what you are saying?

541
00:42:54,557 --> 00:42:56,657
Shh... Don't talk so loud.

542
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,056
Fio.

543
00:43:01,264 --> 00:43:05,257
Look. You are the daughter of a decent man.
Besides, you are not married yet.

544
00:43:05,568 --> 00:43:06,659
Would you hold this for a moment?

545
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,864
Thank you. I made this in a hurry, look!

546
00:43:16,077 --> 00:43:17,478
This really fits.

547
00:43:17,577 --> 00:43:19,478
Would you hold that?

548
00:43:21,384 --> 00:43:24,876
Hey, Miss. I'm a wanted
bounty hunter by the government.

549
00:43:25,588 --> 00:43:26,885
I'm not going to be playing with this plane.

550
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:34,085
I'm sorry
but I have responsibility for this plane.

552
00:43:34,494 --> 00:43:36,694
But, I'm going to take off from the canal
in the back.

554
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,690
And I'm not even sure
if I can fly without any problems.

555
00:43:40,402 --> 00:43:45,396
And, when you're going to fight Curtis
you'll need me as an excellent engineer.

556
00:43:45,608 --> 00:43:47,507
Hey, I'm a man, you know.

557
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:50,407
We are going to be
camping alone on a deserted island.

558
00:43:50,913 --> 00:43:52,608
I don't care,
I like camping very much.

559
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,806
I'm not talking about THAT.

560
00:43:56,318 --> 00:43:57,411
Take her with you.

561
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,411
I want you to win and pay the debt.
You've got to beat Curtis.

562
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,817
My company may go bankrupt
if you don't pay it.

563
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:06,023
Are you really
this girl's grandfather?

564
00:44:06,429 --> 00:44:10,331
You don't have to pay her any money.
I'm going to install this phone for you two.

565
00:44:11,032 --> 00:44:13,831
You really want her to
be wanted by the police.

566
00:44:14,637 --> 00:44:16,228
No. I'm going to be Porco's hostage.

567
00:44:16,938 --> 00:44:21,336
That way they can excuse
their cooperation with you.

569
00:44:23,045 --> 00:44:26,639
So, please, take me with you.

570
00:44:29,952 --> 00:44:31,543
Take off the machine gun on the right side.

571
00:44:31,853 --> 00:44:32,650
What?

572
00:44:32,755 --> 00:44:35,954
There's almost no space
even if you got a small butt.

573
00:44:36,158 --> 00:44:37,552
Take off one machine gun!

574
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,657
Whoa! Thanks!
My butt is bigger than it looks.

575
00:44:40,862 --> 00:44:42,556
It will be just a minute
for me to take the gun off.

576
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:45,360
I want to take off as soon as possible.

577
00:44:45,367 --> 00:44:47,668
Before someone else wants
to come with me as well.

578
00:44:47,678 --> 00:44:50,668
You're too fat for someone else
to fit in your plane.

579
00:44:52,675 --> 00:44:53,972
Grandma, hurry, hurry.

580
00:44:54,476 --> 00:44:56,068
Fio. Bring me back a souvenir.

581
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:07,778
Contact.

582
00:45:16,898 --> 00:45:19,594
Open the door!

583
00:45:26,509 --> 00:45:27,601
Let it go!

584
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,827
Come back with money!

585
00:46:00,242 --> 00:46:01,539
How is the steering, Porco?

586
00:46:02,043 --> 00:46:05,536
This is kind of like a tomboy,
just like you.

587
00:46:09,251 --> 00:46:11,150
Stop the plane at once!
We need to make adjustments!

588
00:46:11,653 --> 00:46:14,248
We don't have the time to do it.
Just do your job!

589
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,655
It's wet with water.

590
00:46:21,063 --> 00:46:22,155
There a ship up ahead!

591
00:46:26,168 --> 00:46:27,260
Let's fly!

592
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:32,170
Easy, easy, tomboy!

593
00:46:32,775 --> 00:46:34,867
The turning wing is shifting to the right.
Use the tab!

594
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:36,070
The tab?

595
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:37,173
The one I put on the stick!

596
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:40,172
Hurry!

597
00:46:52,795 --> 00:46:54,786
Good. It became a nice boy all of a sudden.

598
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:31,528
Beautiful.

599
00:47:32,134 --> 00:47:33,532
How beautiful the world is!

600
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,237
Is he attacking us?

601
00:47:39,842 --> 00:47:41,331
No. He is not attacking.

602
00:47:42,744 --> 00:47:45,235
That's a parade plane of the
Italian Air Force.

603
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:47,539
Looks like it's Fierrali...

604
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:54,853
Do you know him?

605
00:47:55,356 --> 00:47:57,153
The Air Force waits up ahead.

606
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,349
He says he'll tell us how to escape them.

607
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,271
He also says that
we should fly low to the Adriatic Sea.

608
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:23,675
Thanks, comrade!

609
00:48:24,385 --> 00:48:26,684
Thank you!

610
00:48:33,996 --> 00:48:37,387
He said, "don't cast pearls before a swine",
looking at you, Fio.
