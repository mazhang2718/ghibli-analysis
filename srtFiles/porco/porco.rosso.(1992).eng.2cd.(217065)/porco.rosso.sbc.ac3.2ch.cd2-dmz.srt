1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,796
You are so beautiful.

2
00:00:05,902 --> 00:00:09,804
You look like a rose blooming
in a secret flower garden.

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,106
You, bastard! This is private garden.

4
00:00:16,913 --> 00:00:18,608
I really want you to look at this.

5
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:27,210
Oh, this is from Hollywood.

6
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:31,222
About the production
of the scenario and casting you sent.

7
00:00:31,827 --> 00:00:34,921
We are in the middle of preliminary trials

8
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:38,323
The title is "A bouquet of the Adriatic Sea".

9
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:40,030
That's nice.

10
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:42,631
Really? That means O.K., doesn't it?

11
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:44,838
Gina, come to Hollywood with me.

12
00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:50,840
I was air pirates' guardsman
to obtain a fame and fortune.

13
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:54,143
Next I want to be a Hollywood star.

14
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:55,640
And, then?

15
00:00:56,353 --> 00:00:57,546
The President!

16
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:06,460
I'm serious.

17
00:01:07,364 --> 00:01:09,763
I promise to make you the first lady.

18
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:11,956
Gina.

19
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:15,670
I like your for such stupidity.

20
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:16,766
Really?

21
00:01:18,474 --> 00:01:19,373
But I say no...

22
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:21,465
... because I already have a gamble going.

23
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:31,576
If he comes over here
when I'm in this garden, I will love him.

24
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:35,585
But he comes only to the
restaurant at night.

25
00:01:36,293 --> 00:01:38,284
And never emerges in the daylight.

26
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:23,030
That guy is coming back.

27
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,698
Fool...

28
00:03:34,711 --> 00:03:38,009
He left without getting off the plane.
I lost the gamble again.

29
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,907
You're kidding!
The gamble is about that guy?

30
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:43,009
Is that a problem?

31
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,218
Life is more complicated here
than in your country.

32
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:49,819
Here I can fall in love anytime I want.

33
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:53,616
Kid, go to Hollywood by yourself, OK?

34
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:55,423
Kid...

35
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:02,830
I hit my head because you did an acrobatic
maneuver all of a sudden.

36
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,330
I just said hello to my friend.

37
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:07,637
To Gina of the hotel Adriano?

38
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:11,644
She wore a white dress and
was at the terrace of the hotel, wasn't she?

39
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:17,348
My grandpa told me that all pilots of
the Adriatic Sea fall in love with Gina.

41
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:19,346
You speculate a lot.

42
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,550
So, how is the lady?

43
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:24,250
You fell in love with her too,
didn't you?

44
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,055
We are going down to refuel.

45
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:27,954
Close your mouth,
or you'll bite your tongue off.

46
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:29,252
Wa! Wait! Uwaa...

47
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,783
A girl on a fighter?

48
00:04:58,595 --> 00:04:59,584
Where's Porco?

49
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:01,692
He is talking with my dad.

50
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:03,997
Not only the temporary government...

51
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:14,404
... but guys in the King's faction have
tried to get along with the air pirates.

53
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:15,699
Here you are.

54
00:05:16,112 --> 00:05:16,701
Thanks.

55
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:19,110
No thanks for such a bad news.

56
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:23,208
You'd better present yourself to either side.

57
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:26,216
They will pay a fortune for your skill.

58
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:27,814
You got a cigarette?

59
00:05:28,324 --> 00:05:30,814
Curtis is will go back to
America sooner or later.

60
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:34,418
It's us who should to go to America.

61
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:39,428
Goodbye to freedom in the Adriatic Sea.

63
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:41,326
Is it Byron's?

64
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:43,333
No, it's mine.

65
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,230
See you later.

66
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:49,634
Porco, this is bad news.

67
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:53,642
The gas price is three times
as much as in ltaly.

68
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:57,247
Don't be like a businessman,
make it cheaper.

69
00:05:58,053 --> 00:05:59,646
This gas is genuine.

70
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:01,947
That's why I hate women.

71
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:03,949
Hey, Mr. Would you tell her...

72
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,954
Pay him, Fio.

73
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:11,559
After that, put your big butt and your looks
in the space between the machine guns.

74
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:13,156
We're going to fly to my home.

75
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:16,067
I'll add the gas bill to the other bills.

76
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:24,973
Nobody can live alone.
We rely on each other.

77
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:30,480
Nobody lives around here,
even though the landscape is beautiful.

78
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:35,884
Here we are.
That island is my home.

79
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:57,208
It's a wonderful place.

80
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:15,523
An excellent co-ordinator.

81
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,434
Ohh... my butt is stiff from the long flight.

82
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:30,141
The pig!

83
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:35,747
Don't move!

84
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:39,848
They stink, again.

85
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:43,353
Boss, we caught him! Boss!

86
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,860
Shit! Don't step on me... Back off!

87
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:49,653
I was waiting for you, pig!

88
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:51,362
I knew you'd coming here.

89
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:53,165
You gave us a lot of trouble.

90
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,665
It's a girl.

91
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:57,163
The pig is with a girl.

92
00:07:57,673 --> 00:07:58,867
She is pretty.

93
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:01,175
Shut up! What's that about a girl?

94
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:03,067
About a half of the worlds
population are women!

95
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:05,875
Hey, that girl is not an ordinary one.

96
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,278
She is a chief engineer
at the Piccolo company.

97
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:11,483
But, she is very young and pretty.

98
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:13,586
That girl?

99
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:16,887
She made my plane much better than before.

100
00:08:17,593 --> 00:08:19,083
She may be young, but she's really something.

101
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:22,190
Is that true?

102
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:24,898
You are good with airplanes in general.

103
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,197
Be polite, boys.
She came with me to collect my debts.

104
00:08:30,906 --> 00:08:33,307
You are deeply in debt after all.
It serves you right!

105
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:38,610
C'mon men, let's do some damage
around here.

106
00:08:40,615 --> 00:08:41,605
Damage?

107
00:08:42,018 --> 00:08:43,416
Are you going to break the plane I made?

108
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:46,815
Are you going to break
such beautiful airplane with axes?

109
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:50,817
Miss,
there is a complicated reason behind this.

110
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:52,215
You are going to break, aren't you?

111
00:08:52,628 --> 00:08:53,720
But, what I want to say is...

112
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:56,221
Are you guys really fighter pilots?

113
00:08:56,732 --> 00:08:58,826
Would you back off? My shoes.

114
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:11,538
I have grown up with a lot of stories
about the pilots since I was a small child.

115
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,942
My grandpa always told me that
no one is as nice as the pilots.

116
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:21,445
It's because sea and
sky purify their hearts.

117
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,159
Hence, the pilots are much
braver than the sailors...

118
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:28,554
... and more proud
than the ordinary pilots.

119
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:32,467
Don't tell me.

120
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:34,558
I know that.

121
00:09:35,171 --> 00:09:38,264
What they want the most, he said,
is neither money nor women...

122
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:39,769
... but honor.

123
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:41,163
Yes. Yes.

124
00:09:41,776 --> 00:09:42,971
You're right!

125
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:44,674
A toast to the pilots!

126
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:48,674
She's really something.

127
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:50,375
I understand.

128
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:53,682
I'll give up on breaking the plane,
you made, with axes.

129
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:57,985
But we'll be mortified
if we don't do anything.

130
00:09:58,594 --> 00:10:00,186
Let's lynch the pig!

131
00:10:01,197 --> 00:10:03,187
Lynch the pig!

132
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,889
What the hell you talking about!

133
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:07,590
You guys don't understand anything.

134
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:10,003
I asked whether you feel ashamed or not.

135
00:10:10,706 --> 00:10:13,003
Aren't you ashamed of being helped by Curtis,
the American?

136
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,403
If your mother heard of that,
she would cry.

137
00:10:15,912 --> 00:10:17,105
And you don't even take a shower.

138
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:21,110
Porco came back to fight against Curtis...

139
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:25,413
... for pride and honor of the
pilots of the Adriatic.

140
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:30,215
You guys are lowest of the low!

141
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:34,423
I told you not to hire Curtis, eh!

142
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:36,328
Just like a girl.

143
00:10:36,832 --> 00:10:37,924
Don't try to excuse yourself.

144
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,230
Boss, what are we supposed to do?

145
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:41,326
She convinced us.

146
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:46,639
How about asking Curtis to fight the pig?

147
00:10:46,743 --> 00:10:48,840
Do we ask him to fight the pig, again?

148
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:50,835
The contract is already over.

149
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,947
I'm ashamed of it...

150
00:10:57,854 --> 00:10:59,048
That's Curtis!

151
00:11:02,758 --> 00:11:03,951
I got it.

152
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:06,650
I'm not going to run away!

153
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:13,264
You made your passage through there?

154
00:11:23,178 --> 00:11:24,373
Hey, hold this.

155
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:31,683
You want a return match, don't you.

156
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:34,989
But I won once, already.

157
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,087
Besides, I am not a bounty hunter
for these guys.

158
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:40,384
What's your proposition?

159
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:52,600
Beautiful!

160
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:56,102
Will you marry me if I win?

161
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,008
I'm serious.

162
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:02,413
O.K.

163
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:06,413
Instead, if Porco wins,
you pay these bills.

164
00:12:06,721 --> 00:12:08,313
Wait, Fio!

165
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:09,812
You back off!

166
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,629
Miss, you still have time
to think about that.

167
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:18,025
Ask him, not me.

168
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:20,124
This is very expensive.

169
00:12:20,535 --> 00:12:21,331
It's very cheap.

170
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:22,936
Are you going to fight or not?

171
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,432
I'm willing to fight...

172
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,534
... for love.

173
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:27,932
O.K.

174
00:12:29,144 --> 00:12:30,543
Listen up everybody.

175
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:32,846
I'm really impressed
with Miss Fio's decision.

176
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:36,246
We, "Mamma Aiuto",
are going to back up this fight up!

177
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:38,346
Yes.

178
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:39,947
Let the air pirates union do this, too!

179
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:41,846
Yes.

180
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,557
Miss Fio! See you soon!

181
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:51,557
This sucks!

182
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:54,558
Hey pig, don't run away!

183
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:58,065
Shut up, get lost!

184
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:00,971
Bye-bye!

185
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,576
This is ridiculous. Well, you are...

186
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:13,081
Don't tell me. I know, I am foolish.

187
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:20,592
Fio...

188
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:24,288
... I think I have to say thank you.

189
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,692
You gave me a chance to fight Curtis.

190
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:28,392
Thanks.

191
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:30,995
We share the same luck.

192
00:13:31,907 --> 00:13:33,203
We are partners, aren't we?

193
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:37,005
We are going to have a hard time.

194
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:39,910
I trust you.

195
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:44,910
Trust me, eh?
I haven't heard that in a long time...

196
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,913
... but I'm glad you said that.

197
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:55,326
What's wrong? You feel sick?

198
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:56,923
Fio?

199
00:13:57,432 --> 00:13:58,422
I'm fine.

200
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:02,631
It's just that my heart is pounding.

201
00:14:03,337 --> 00:14:08,538
To be honest, I was really scared.

202
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:13,937
Hey?

203
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,442
I want to swim.

204
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,061
Porco! I made a mistake!

205
00:14:36,672 --> 00:14:37,660
Are you O.K?

206
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:41,269
I should have padded the deal.

207
00:14:42,477 --> 00:14:44,173
We have a bad bargain.

208
00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:49,975
You're right.

209
00:15:43,337 --> 00:15:44,634
Porco...

210
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,229
Hmm?

211
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:47,331
You can't sleep, can you?

212
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:53,038
Now, I just saw...
It may have been a dream...

213
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,942
Everything is all right.

214
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:58,349
It's too early in the morning to get up.

215
00:15:59,154 --> 00:16:00,349
Porco?

216
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:02,846
Why did you become a pig?

217
00:16:03,558 --> 00:16:05,150
I don't know.

218
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:09,759
I know a lot about Captain Marco Pabatto.

219
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,462
My father used to be in the same unit.

220
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,961
I've heard many stories,
in which the captain...

221
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,364
... saved the lives of enemy pilots.
I liked it.

222
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,179
Porco! How about if I kiss you?

223
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:31,575
You know a fairy tale
where a princess takes off...

224
00:16:31,986 --> 00:16:33,476
... a curse on a prince,
who was changed to a frog.

225
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:37,380
You, silly. Save it for your man!

226
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:41,190
Won't my kiss work?

227
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:45,390
Huh, you are a nice girl.

228
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,197
You make me feel comfortable...

229
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:50,298
... and make me wish
to be a human being again.

230
00:16:51,307 --> 00:16:53,104
Be a nice girl and go to sleep.

231
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:55,500
Tell me your story and I will.

232
00:16:57,312 --> 00:16:58,506
My story?

233
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,008
Well...

234
00:17:10,924 --> 00:17:14,123
It was the last summer of the war.

235
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:20,924
We were fly over the Adriatic Sea
on our usual patrol.

236
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:29,038
Belneldi was flying on my right side.

237
00:17:29,545 --> 00:17:33,345
He was an old friend of mine.
He got married just two days before.

238
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,142
I was the matchmaker.

239
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,243
He didn't have enough leave
to be with his wife for long.

240
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:43,056
So, he returned to duty.

241
00:18:03,377 --> 00:18:06,471
Everyone was falling down like flies,
whether a friend or a foe.

242
00:18:07,281 --> 00:18:09,580
I was chased by three planes...

243
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:12,679
... and had no time to worry about my friend.

244
00:18:13,388 --> 00:18:15,982
At the end I was the only one
remaining of my unit.

245
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:18,585
But, they never gave up chasing me.

246
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:20,786
I made desperate efforts to run away.

247
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:23,189
My hands and feet went numb...

248
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:26,692
... and I grew dizzy.
I thought I was going to die.

249
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:31,097
It was at that time that
I saw the white sky.

251
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:32,699
White?

252
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,505
Yeah, it was like a flash.

253
00:18:37,512 --> 00:18:41,710
Because of the brightness,
it took me a while to realize that I was in a cloud.

254
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:46,414
I was worn out, and
didn't have any power left to control my plane.

255
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,324
In spite of that my plane continued to fly.

256
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:18,646
And what happened then?

257
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:21,954
It was calm...

258
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,253
... and the sky was very clear, too clear.

259
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,257
There was a line of clouds far above me.

260
00:19:57,792 --> 00:19:59,692
Belneldi, you are alive, aren't you!

261
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:05,790
Belneldi, wait, where are you going!

262
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:22,105
Belneldi, don't go!
Are you going to leave Gina alone?!

263
00:20:23,116 --> 00:20:24,414
I'll go instead of you!

264
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,459
When I recovered my senses, I was flying
over the sea, almost touching it, alone.

265
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:15,759
God said it wasn't your time yet,
didn't he?

266
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:22,567
In my mind I thought he might
let me fly like that forever.

267
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:25,569
That would not have been right,
because your are a good guy!

268
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,471
The good guys are all dead already.

269
00:21:29,084 --> 00:21:30,982
Besides, there might have been
Hell inside that cloud.

270
00:21:31,686 --> 00:21:34,679
Well, my story is over.
Go to sleep.

271
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:39,990
Shit, they gave me crap.

272
00:21:42,096 --> 00:21:44,691
I'm glad you came back to live

273
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,996
because I like you.

274
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:49,701
Goodnight!

275
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:15,123
Hey, hey, which one's gonna win,
a pig or...

277
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:23,028
Icecream? Telescope?

278
00:22:31,746 --> 00:22:34,442
Fools. They make a festival of our fight.

279
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,540
Are they all air pirates?

280
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:38,540
Trash of the Mediterranean Sea.

281
00:22:39,153 --> 00:22:44,954
Gangs, pirates, smugglers,
spies and even some ordinary people.

282
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:48,961
This makes my fame rise more and more.

283
00:22:50,263 --> 00:22:53,164
Ten minutes till start!
Ten minutes till start!

284
00:22:54,469 --> 00:22:58,962
This is the fight between Porco Rosso
and Donald Curtis!

285
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:01,173
There are no special rules...

286
00:23:01,576 --> 00:23:05,478
... but an unfair fight will a
disgrace to their fans.

287
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,972
Shut up and start right now. Back off!

288
00:23:13,288 --> 00:23:17,087
You shut up, or I kill you!

289
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:28,392
He'd be better off throwing a 10 ton bomb.

290
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:33,200
This is the fight which will determine
the future of Miss Fio Piccolo.

291
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:35,199
Shut up!

292
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:37,098
Do you understand?

293
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:38,807
If you do, clap your hands.

294
00:23:39,213 --> 00:23:40,009
Clap!

295
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:47,920
Shut up, that's the routine.

295
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:51,220
Well, both of you present your bids.

296
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,923
Have a seat.

297
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:57,924
Thank you.

298
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:00,424
Put it on the chair properly!

299
00:24:03,237 --> 00:24:07,038
None of you have anything to say, do you.
Well shake hands or something before you start!

300
00:24:07,741 --> 00:24:10,539
No way. I'm fond of cleanliness.

301
00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:15,540
He's hard to please.

302
00:24:15,851 --> 00:24:18,045
Fio, as soon as this fight is over,
we will go to the church.

303
00:24:19,753 --> 00:24:23,451
Don't worry.
My mom told me your going to like me soon.

304
00:24:28,864 --> 00:24:29,557
You...

305
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:31,355
May I take a picture with you?

306
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:32,565
I took a shower already.

307
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:34,365
Everybody, smile!

308
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:36,767
SMILE!

309
00:24:58,093 --> 00:25:00,891
If the flight is over in 3 minutes,
the black plane has the advantage...

310
00:25:01,695 --> 00:25:05,188
This is great.
I want them to do this event every month.

311
00:25:08,002 --> 00:25:09,993
15 seconds to go.

312
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:15,401
They are so cool.

313
00:25:17,411 --> 00:25:18,308
5 seconds to go.

314
00:25:18,913 --> 00:25:23,112
4, 3, 2, 1, 0!

315
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:33,022
Curtis took off first!

316
00:25:51,145 --> 00:25:52,942
This is going to be a one-sided fight.

317
00:25:53,347 --> 00:25:54,336
Give me that.

318
00:26:00,855 --> 00:26:03,255
Porco, what are you doing! Fly over!

319
00:26:03,656 --> 00:26:05,647
He would be shot if the took off now.

320
00:26:06,161 --> 00:26:08,152
It's very difficult for Curtis
to shoot Porco in this situation.

321
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:17,361
I know you want me to waste the bullet's.
I know it.

322
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:35,883
Looping! The pig took Curtis' back!

323
00:26:36,691 --> 00:26:37,679
Looping?

324
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:40,490
His skill made the pig
an ace of the Adriatic Sea.

325
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,797
Shit!

326
00:26:53,106 --> 00:26:54,005
He's gonna shoot!

327
00:26:58,913 --> 00:26:59,811
He doesn't open fire.

328
00:27:00,213 --> 00:27:01,203
Is his machine-gun broken!?

329
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:02,910
I got it, I got it!

330
00:27:03,616 --> 00:27:05,414
The pig won't shoot until the end.

331
00:27:06,621 --> 00:27:07,917
The pig doesn't kill anybody.

332
00:27:08,923 --> 00:27:10,914
Now, the American should be fine.

333
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:12,616
You got it! Go and shoot!

334
00:27:13,428 --> 00:27:16,420
Oh, he didn't shoot yet.... See,
I told you...

335
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,527
If the pig opened fire, it would kill
the American, so it's going to hit...

336
00:27:20,035 --> 00:27:24,027
... Curtis' engine a few bullets
after Curtis gets tired.

337
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:27,730
He said this is not war, but...

338
00:27:28,143 --> 00:27:28,938
Porco...

339
00:27:30,144 --> 00:27:31,544
Are you teasing me or what?

340
00:27:32,047 --> 00:27:32,944
Come on!

341
00:27:34,347 --> 00:27:38,843
Is your gun broken, huh! You,
poor bastard!

342
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,557
They are coming this way!

343
00:27:48,663 --> 00:27:51,063
Come on, pig!

344
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,160
Go away from here and fight over there!

345
00:27:58,771 --> 00:27:59,967
Great! The pig is leaving a cloud trail.

346
00:28:01,776 --> 00:28:03,071
Come on!

347
00:28:13,188 --> 00:28:14,883
Shoot the other side!

348
00:28:19,894 --> 00:28:22,489
It's cool! It's the first time
I saw the plance leaving a cloud trail!

349
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:32,396
I've never seen such an air fight before.

350
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:34,003
I'm really impressed.

351
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:45,009
I'm ready for the flight.

352
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,614
She'd better hurry,
or the fight will be over.

353
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:49,212
She's in her room, and doesn't come out.

354
00:28:49,923 --> 00:28:52,018
Does she want to go or not?

355
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:53,826
I want to see that fight.

356
00:29:04,838 --> 00:29:07,740
To G of Heart, for the pig.

357
00:29:08,241 --> 00:29:11,143
The air force found out about the fight.
Stop the silly fight.

358
00:29:11,545 --> 00:29:13,343
Oh, this must be from Fierrali.

359
00:29:16,651 --> 00:29:17,844
I must hurry.

360
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,170
First of all,
both of them are very tough.

361
00:29:39,874 --> 00:29:41,567
The show isn't over!

362
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:46,179
Porco, fight!

364
00:29:57,792 --> 00:30:00,490
I'm not going to give Fio to a man
like you.

365
00:30:07,102 --> 00:30:08,192
O.K. the pig took Curtis' tail.

366
00:30:09,003 --> 00:30:10,196
It's over!

366
00:30:17,403 --> 00:30:18,496
Jammed.

367
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:24,614
This is the end.

368
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,621
Whoops... Jammed, too.

369
00:30:31,526 --> 00:30:34,518
You, idiot! You are out of ammo!

370
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:38,228
Whoops.
This is broken because of Fio's butt...

371
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:43,536
I'm not going to finish this fight with a draw.

372
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,834
This is not a western. You can't hit me.

373
00:30:51,445 --> 00:30:53,436
You...

374
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:59,248
You really think it will reach here?

375
00:31:07,061 --> 00:31:08,460
You, stinking pig!

376
00:31:11,365 --> 00:31:12,663
Can't throw it!

377
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:14,963
Bastard!

378
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:16,060
Throw it finally!

379
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,469
For love!

380
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:18,759
Shut up! You piggy!

381
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:21,165
Looks like something is wrong.

382
00:31:22,277 --> 00:31:23,368
Ah... they are coming.

383
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:32,884
They are coming back!

384
00:31:33,387 --> 00:31:35,878
Wait! Bids don't leave from here.

385
00:31:37,192 --> 00:31:38,784
O.K. Wait, you guys.

386
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,192
You, fat pig!

387
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:50,701
You, chicken cowboy!

388
00:31:57,311 --> 00:31:58,801
Come on with your bare hands!

389
00:31:59,114 --> 00:32:00,307
Go back to cows!

390
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,219
Porco, hold on!

391
00:32:11,424 --> 00:32:12,619
Stand up, pig.

392
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:18,722
Go, go!

393
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,458
Finish him!
Come on Porco!

393
00:32:48,361 --> 00:32:50,458
Bets still stand!

394
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:54,461
Where's the betting table?

395
00:32:58,373 --> 00:33:02,074
- Can't you fly much faster?
- It's impossible. Engine would blow.

397
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:04,777
Pilots are all stupid, aren't they?

398
00:33:11,486 --> 00:33:15,682
Hey, Fio. Did you see my punch?

399
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:21,683
I'm gonna take him down next round.

400
00:33:22,396 --> 00:33:24,694
I'll take you down this time.

401
00:33:24,897 --> 00:33:26,387
Porco, hang on!

402
00:33:27,101 --> 00:33:30,000
I'll make prosciutto out of you!

403
00:33:31,306 --> 00:33:32,500
Come on, you chicken!

404
00:33:34,008 --> 00:33:35,405
You are the chicken!

406
00:33:38,011 --> 00:33:39,807
That was my word.

407
00:33:39,914 --> 00:33:41,411
You seduce all women around you.

408
00:33:41,514 --> 00:33:43,611
Choose Gina or Fio, either one!

409
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:45,413
What?

410
00:33:48,623 --> 00:33:51,021
Don't choose both.

411
00:33:52,926 --> 00:33:54,518
Gina is...

412
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,728
Don't say, Gina, Gina.

413
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:05,035
Gina loves you, pig.

414
00:34:08,342 --> 00:34:10,333
She is...

415
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:14,445
... waiting for you...

416
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:19,342
... at the garden!

417
00:34:27,262 --> 00:34:28,250
Porco!

418
00:34:28,663 --> 00:34:30,460
Drumroll!

419
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:34,860
It's over! Look at that!

420
00:34:38,972 --> 00:34:41,271
I can see it.
The Italian Air Force hasn't arrived, yet.

421
00:34:52,887 --> 00:34:55,878
You are unfair... You're a dirty liar.

422
00:35:00,094 --> 00:35:02,891
Don't you understand, you idiot.

423
00:35:03,297 --> 00:35:05,094
I am not telling a lie...

424
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:10,793
I don't give Fio to you.

425
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:13,101
That's Gina's plane.

426
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:16,798
It's an emergency signal.

427
00:35:28,722 --> 00:35:31,021
1, 2...

428
00:35:31,224 --> 00:35:32,920
The winner is the one who stand up first.

429
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:35,922
Everybody, let me through.

430
00:35:36,431 --> 00:35:40,423
6, 7, Gina, don't.

431
00:35:41,936 --> 00:35:42,731
8!

432
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:46,438
Marco, Marco, can you hear me?

433
00:35:49,643 --> 00:35:52,237
Do you want another girl to be unhappy?

434
00:35:57,751 --> 00:35:58,844
9!

435
00:36:01,755 --> 00:36:02,847
Porco!

436
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,052
Porco!

437
00:36:07,362 --> 00:36:08,851
Porco, thank you!

438
00:36:09,563 --> 00:36:11,259
Well...

439
00:36:18,672 --> 00:36:19,969
This party is over.

440
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,070
The Air Force will be here soon.

441
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:24,273
Everybody run away quickly, please.

442
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,382
Then stop by my restaurant.
I will serve you all.

443
00:36:31,585 --> 00:36:32,882
Everybody, let's go!

444
00:36:44,398 --> 00:36:45,297
It's over, Mr.

445
00:36:49,003 --> 00:36:50,902
Hey, boss, hurry up!

446
00:36:51,004 --> 00:36:52,998
Shut up! I'm coming.

447
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,309
I don't like the pig, but I like you.

448
00:36:58,112 --> 00:37:00,204
Goodbye!

449
00:37:01,114 --> 00:37:03,811
Thank you.
Take a shower sometimes, will you?

450
00:37:04,818 --> 00:37:07,413
Thank you, too, Mr. Curtis.

451
00:37:07,922 --> 00:37:10,617
Next time I'll propose you formally,
not as a bet.

452
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:14,219
O.K. But I've made up my mind already.

453
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:17,128
You, get on Gina's plane.

454
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,327
No! No!

455
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:22,134
I'm going on Porco's plane.
You said I'm your partner, didn't you.

456
00:37:24,237 --> 00:37:27,536
Gina. Take her home, please.

457
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:32,240
You always do this.

458
00:37:35,148 --> 00:37:37,445
I'm sorry. Please leave.

459
00:37:43,155 --> 00:37:44,248
Let's go.

460
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,181
The Italian Air Force is finally coming.

461
00:38:18,793 --> 00:38:21,887
Do you want to help me?
I'm going to lead them astray.

462
00:38:23,297 --> 00:38:25,389
Wait, your face!

463
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,092
Let me see your face!

464
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:28,898
Your plane is over there, eh?

465
00:38:29,302 --> 00:38:30,599
Let me see it a little bit!

466
00:38:39,413 --> 00:38:41,813
After the flight from the Air Force,

467
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:45,110
I returned to Milan.

468
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:48,112
I haven't seen Porco since.

469
00:38:50,123 --> 00:38:54,320
Instead, I have found
a very good friend in Miss Gina.

470
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:00,125
Since the fight,
there have been many wars.

471
00:39:01,134 --> 00:39:03,728
But I still keep in touch with Gina.

472
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:07,838
After I took over the "Piccolo" factory,

473
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,143
I made it a rule to spend summer vacations
at the Hotel Adriano.

474
00:39:14,648 --> 00:39:17,139
Miss Gina has become even more beautiful since.

475
00:39:17,751 --> 00:39:20,152
Old friends still stop
by the Hotel all the time.

476
00:39:22,356 --> 00:39:25,347
Mr. Curtis, now I recall...

477
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,951
...writes to me sometimes.
Though he is not the president of the USA, yet...

478
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:32,057
... he says he longs for the summer
of Adriatic Sea.

479
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:36,460
It's only our secret that Gina...

480
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,972
... won her gamble.

481
00:43:30,103 --> 00:43:34,402
The End
