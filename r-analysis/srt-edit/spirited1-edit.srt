1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:13,084
Tokuma Shoten, Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Walt Disney Japan, Tohokushinsha Film and Mitsubishi present Good luck, Chihiro Hope we meet again Chihiro?

2
00:00:13,104 --> 00:00:19,088
Chihiro!

3
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,770
We're almost there.

4
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,608
This really is the middle of nowhere.

5
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,569
I'll have to shop in the next town.

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,818
We'll just have to make do.

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,159
Look, there's the elementary school.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,158
That's your new school, Chihiro.

9
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,282
Why, it looks very nice.

10
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,126
I liked my old school.

11
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,181
Mom, my flowers got bent.

12
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,809
No wonder, the way you squeeze them.

13
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,980
A little water and they'll perk right up.

14
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:07,525
My first bouquet, and it's farewell flowers.

15
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:11,112
What about the rose you got for your birthday?

16
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:12,688
One rose?

17
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,273
One rose isn't a bouquet.

18
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,033
You dropped the card.

19
00:01:16,044 --> 00:01:18,314
Now pull yourself together.

20
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:20,604
This is a busy day for us.

21
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:50,496
SPIRITED AWAY Wait a minute.

22
00:01:50,516 --> 00:02:01,361
Did I take a wrong turn?

23
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,205
I don't get it.

24
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,534
That must be it up there.

25
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,416
The blue one on the end.

26
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,172
That's it.

27
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,250
I guess I turned off too soon.

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,343
Maybe if we go straight?

29
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:16,647
Oh, please.

30
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:17,960
That's how we always get lost.

31
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,173
Let's just see what's up here.

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,295
- What are those things?

33
00:02:22,315 --> 00:02:24,210
- Houses for the guardian spirits.

34
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,610
Dad, are you sure?

35
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,405
Don't worry, we've got 4-wheel drive.

36
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,361
Sit down, Chihiro.

37
00:02:57,354 --> 00:02:58,583
What are you doing?

38
00:02:58,603 --> 00:02:59,832
Slow down!

39
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,682
There's a tunnel.

40
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,781
What's this building?

41
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,825
It looks like a gate.

42
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,784
Honey, I think we should go back.

43
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,824
Chihiro!

44
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,330
Honestly...

45
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,086
Look at this, it's just plaster.

46
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,289
This thing's pretty new.

47
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,801
The air's blowing in.

48
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,309
What is it?

49
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,808
Let's see what's on the other side.

50
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,384
It's creepy, Dad.

51
00:03:51,404 --> 00:03:52,548
Can't we go back?

52
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:54,870
Don't be such a chicken.

53
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,934
C'mon, let's take a look.

54
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,238
The movers will be there soon.

55
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:00,619
So?

56
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,009
They've got the keys.

57
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:03,399
They'll handle everything.

58
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,577
I know, but...

59
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:05,652
No!

60
00:04:05,672 --> 00:04:06,736
I won't go.

61
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,708
Dad, let's go.

62
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,334
Come on, it'll be fun.

63
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,208
I'm staying here!

64
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,965
Chihiro, you wait in the car.

65
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,806
Mom...

66
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,097
Wait up!

67
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,195
Watch your step.

68
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:40,958
Chihiro, don't cling.

69
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:42,730
You'll make me trip.

70
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:16,304
- What is this?

71
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:18,054
- Wait, hear that?

72
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,172
- A train.

73
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:29,694
- Maybe we're near a station.

74
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:30,716
Let's find out.

75
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:31,738
It must be close.

76
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,619
Houses, way out here?

77
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,447
I knew it.

78
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,621
It's an abandoned theme park.

79
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,754
They built lots of them back in the nineties.

80
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,458
But they went bust when the economy tanked.

81
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,051
This must be one of them.

82
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,137
Wait, where are we going?

83
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,966
Let's go back, Dad.

84
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,600
Please!

85
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,112
Mom, that building's moaning.

86
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,450
It's just the wind.

87
00:06:49,753 --> 00:06:52,086
What a lovely spot.

88
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:54,439
We should've brought the sandwiches.

89
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,327
This would've been a river.

90
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,464
Do you smell something?

91
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,647
- Something smells good.

92
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,294
- You're right.

93
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:13,304
Maybe they're open for business after all.

94
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,100
Hurry up, Chihiro.

95
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,395
Wait for me!

96
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,846
This way.

97
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,571
Can you believe it?

98
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:59,343
Nothing but restaurants.

99
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,727
There's nobody here.

100
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,693
Over there.

101
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,029
Come on!

102
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,746
Come take a look.

103
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,425
This is amazing.

104
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,469
Hello, is anybody here?

105
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,772
Come on, Chihiro.

106
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,084
It looks delicious.

107
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,557
You got customers!

108
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:43,137
Don't worry.

109
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,930
We'll pay when they show up.

110
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:46,265
You're right.

111
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:47,599
Let's see now...

112
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,938
What kind of bird is this?

113
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,000
It's delicious!

114
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,562
Chihiro, try some.

115
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,069
I don't want any.

116
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:57,629
Can't we go?

117
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,191
They'll be mad at us.

118
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,583
Don't worry, your father's here.

119
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,912
I've got credit cards and cash.

120
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:10,142
Have some, Chihiro.

121
00:09:10,162 --> 00:09:11,579
It's very tender.

122
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:14,210
- Mustard.

123
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,294
- Thanks.

124
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:27,242
Mom!

125
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:28,679
Dad!

126
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,597
What a weird building.

127
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,128
A train!

128
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:22,542
You can't be here.

129
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:23,580
Go now!

130
00:11:24,444 --> 00:11:26,009
It's almost sundown.

131
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:27,594
Go before it gets dark!

132
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:31,180
They're lighting the lamps.

133
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,306
Come on!

134
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:33,704
I'll hold them off.

135
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:35,101
Get across the river!

136
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,453
What's his problem?

137
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,171
Dad?

138
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,764
Dad, let's go home.

139
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,683
Let's go, Dad!

140
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,954
Dad!

141
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,501
Mom!

142
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,966
Mommy!

143
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,038
Water!

144
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,636
No...

145
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,589
It's just a dream.

146
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,170
Wake up, wake up.

147
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,459
Wake up!

148
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,476
Please wake up.

149
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,238
It's just a dream, a stupid dream.

150
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,321
Go away, disappear.

151
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,113
Disappear.

152
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,619
I'm fading away!

153
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,883
This has to be a dream.

154
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:55,716
Don't be afraid.

155
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:56,965
I'm a friend.

156
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,140
No, no, no!

157
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:00,306
Open your mouth.

158
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:01,265
Eat this.

159
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,152
Unless you eat something from this world, you'll disappear.

160
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,650
No!

161
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:11,129
Don't worry.

162
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:12,734
You won't turn into a pig.

163
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,822
Chew it and swallow.

164
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,800
Good, now you'll be fine.

165
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,674
See for yourself.

166
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,061
I can touch you.

167
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:39,261
Of course.

168
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:40,470
Now come.

169
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:42,574
Where's Mom and Dad?

170
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:44,677
Did they really turn into pigs?

171
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,446
You can't see them now, but you will.

172
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,738
Quiet!

173
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:11,377
It's looking for you.

174
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:13,087
There's no time, let's run.

175
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:15,485
I can't stand up.

176
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:16,882
What should I do?

177
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:18,924
- My legs don't work.

178
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,924
- Relax and take a deep breath.

179
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,813
In the name of the wind and water within, unbind her.

180
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,064
Stand up!

181
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,322
Don't breathe while we're on the bridge.

182
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,048
One tiny breath will break my spell.

183
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:21,696
We don't want anyone to see you.

184
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,338
I'm scared.

185
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,048
Be calm.

186
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,176
Welcome, your presence honors us.

187
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,596
Greetings, welcome.

188
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:37,398
- I've finished my rounds.

189
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:39,085
- Welcome back, sir.

190
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,053
Take a deep breath.

191
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,312
Hold it.

192
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:03,050
Welcome back.

193
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,988
We've been waiting for you.

194
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,086
Just a little further.

195
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,589
Master Haku!

196
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,959
Where have you...

197
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,170
A human?

198
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,304
Run!

199
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,073
Master Haku, Master Haku!

200
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:38,440
I smell something.

201
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,816
A human intruder!

202
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:41,005
I smell humans!

203
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:42,193
The stench of humans!

204
00:18:42,214 --> 00:18:43,591
- They know you're here.

205
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:44,988
- Sorry, I messed up.

206
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,372
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

207
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:48,783
Now listen.

208
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:50,075
I'll tell you what to do.

209
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,880
If you stay here, they'll find you.

210
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,759
I'll distract them while you get away.

211
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,062
No, don't go!

212
00:18:57,082 --> 00:18:58,374
Stay with me, please.

213
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,973
You have no choice, if you want to survive here...

214
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,892
and save your parents, too.

215
00:19:04,737 --> 00:19:06,114
So I wasn't dreaming.

216
00:19:06,134 --> 00:19:07,511
They did turn into pigs.

217
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,143
Listen carefully.

218
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,443
After I'm gone, go through the back gate.

219
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,488
Take the stairs all the way down.

220
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,698
You'll find the boiler room where...

221
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,367
they stoke the fires.

222
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,868
Look for Kamaji.

223
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,364
Kamaji?

224
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,750
Ask him for work.

225
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,624
If he refuses, keep asking.

226
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,628
If you don't work, Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

227
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,216
Yubaba?

228
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,136
She's the sorceress who rules our world.

229
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,597
She'll try to trick you into leaving...

230
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,391
but keep asking for work.

231
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:46,923
The work's hard, but it will protect you.

232
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:49,339
Then even Yubaba can't harm you.

233
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,397
Master Haku, Master Haku!

234
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,734
I have to go.

235
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:56,936
- Remember I'm your friend, Chihiro.

236
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:59,147
- How did you know my name?

237
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,655
You told me long ago.

238
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,910
My name is Haku.

239
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,623
Here I am!

240
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,752
Master Haku, Yubaba's waiting.

241
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,957
I know, I've been searching too.

242
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,998
Um...

243
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,217
Excuse me.

244
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,391
Um...

245
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,442
Are you Kamaji?

246
00:24:53,043 --> 00:24:54,961
Haku sent me.

247
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:56,899
Please let me work here.

248
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,750
What, all at once?

249
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,665
Get to work, you little runts!

250
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:14,053
I am Kamaji, slave to the boilers that heat the baths.

251
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,427
Step on it, boys!

252
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,600
Please let me work here.

253
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:21,780
I've got all the help I need.

254
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,969
There's soot everywhere.

255
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:27,105
I'll never run out of help.

256
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,533
Oh, I'm sorry.

257
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,298
Wait a second.

258
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,636
Out of the way.

259
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,942
Wait, what do I do with this?

260
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,329
Do I leave it here?

261
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,828
Finish what you start.

262
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,240
Get to work, runts!

263
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,220
Wanna turn back into soot?

264
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:14,140
And you, better watch it.

265
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,058
You can't just take someone's work.

266
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,697
If they don't work, their spell will be broken.

267
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:21,353
There's no work for you here.

268
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:23,018
Try somewhere else.

269
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,462
You sootballs got a problem?

270
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,165
Get to work!

271
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,834
Chow time!

272
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,549
What, you guys at it again?

273
00:28:43,273 --> 00:28:44,815
Give it a rest.

274
00:28:44,835 --> 00:28:46,377
Where's your bowl?

275
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,344
I keep telling you to leave it out.

276
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:50,759
Food's here.

277
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:52,134
Break time!

278
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:08,653
The human!

279
00:29:08,673 --> 00:29:09,779
You're gonna catch it.

280
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,209
They're having a fit about it upstairs.

281
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,127
She's my granddaughter.

282
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,796
Your granddaughter!

283
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:21,300
She says she wants work, but I don't need any help.

284
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,971
Could you take her to Yubaba for me?

285
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,889
This girl can handle herself.

286
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,152
Not a chance.

287
00:29:28,172 --> 00:29:29,424
Yubaba would kill me.

288
00:29:29,444 --> 00:29:31,925
Not even for this?

289
00:29:31,945 --> 00:29:34,426
Charcoal-roasted newt, finest quality.

290
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:40,444
If you want work, you have to sign a contract with Yubaba.

291
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,864
Might as well try your luck.

292
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,336
Fine!

293
00:29:45,356 --> 00:29:46,858
You there, follow me.

294
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,626
What about "Yes, ma'am" or "Thank you"?

295
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,128
Yes, ma'am.

296
00:29:57,139 --> 00:29:57,869
What a klutz.

297
00:29:57,889 --> 00:29:58,619
Move it!

298
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,797
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:30:02,227 --> 00:30:03,792
Leave the shoes.

300
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:05,377
And the socks!

301
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,759
Yes'm.

302
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:14,050
Aren't you going to thank Kamaji?

303
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,175
He's looking out for you.

304
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,359
Thank you very much.

305
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,188
Good luck.

306
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,743
Yubaba lives on the top floor in the back.

307
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,601
Move it, will you?

308
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,481
You'll lose your nose.

309
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,540
- One more elevator after this.

310
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,000
- Yes'm.

311
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,639
We're here.

312
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,345
Welcome, sir!

313
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:44,412
This elevator stops here.

314
00:31:44,432 --> 00:31:46,725
Please use another one.

315
00:32:09,271 --> 00:32:10,563
- He's following us.

316
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:11,875
- Quit gawking.

317
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,565
Here we are.

318
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,829
Your room is on the right.

319
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:40,571
- Lin?

320
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:41,820
- Yes, sir!

321
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,168
Something smells.

322
00:32:45,557 --> 00:32:46,725
It's human.

323
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:47,913
You reek of human.

324
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,467
Is that so?

325
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,209
I smell it, I do.

326
00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:52,919
Smells mighty tasty, too.

327
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,928
You're hiding something.

328
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,350
Tell me the truth.

329
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,803
Maybe it's this.

330
00:33:00,071 --> 00:33:01,281
Roasted newt?

331
00:33:01,301 --> 00:33:02,511
Give it here!

332
00:33:02,532 --> 00:33:04,222
Not a chance.

333
00:33:04,242 --> 00:33:05,932
The girls asked me to get it.

334
00:33:05,994 --> 00:33:07,576
I'm begging you.

335
00:33:07,596 --> 00:33:09,178
I'll settle for a leg.

336
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,200
Pull the lever to go up, sir.

337
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,548
Can't you even knock?

338
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:04,311
What a plain little girl.

339
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,564
Now, come.

340
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,952
I said, come!

341
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,674
Ow...

342
00:35:48,823 --> 00:35:50,343
What a racket.

343
00:35:50,363 --> 00:35:51,883
Could you be quiet?

344
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,036
Please...

345
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,540
Let me work here.

346
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:26,016
Stop your babbling.

347
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,517
Why do I need a weakling like you?

348
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:34,017
Besides, this is no place for humans.

349
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,444
Millions of spirits come here...

350
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:41,491
to purge themselves of toil and care.

351
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,858
Your parents, my goodness!

352
00:36:43,878 --> 00:36:45,526
They certainly had some nerve.

353
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:49,248
Gobbling our guests' food like a couple of pigs.

354
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,577
Just deserts, I'd say.

355
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:57,420
And as for you, you'll never see your world again either.

356
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,971
You'd make a lovely piglet.

357
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,176
Or perhaps a lump of coal?

358
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,483
Trembling, aren't you?

359
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,237
Still, I'm impressed you made it this far.

360
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,692
Someone must've helped you.

361
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,993
I must thank your friend.

362
00:37:26,004 --> 00:37:28,400
Just who was it, my dear?

363
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,816
You can tell me.

364
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,294
Please let me work here!

365
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,962
Not that again!

366
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,585
I want to work here!

367
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:43,842
Shut your mouth!

368
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:51,185
Why on earth should I hire you?

369
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:55,647
Anyone can see you're a lazy, spoiled, stupid crybaby.

370
00:37:55,648 --> 00:38:00,778
What job would I possibly have for someone like you?

371
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:03,810
You're wasting your time.

372
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,851
I've got all the bums I need.

373
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:11,955
Or maybe I'll give you the nastiest job I've got...

374
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,124
and work you night and day...

375
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:19,252
until you breathe your very last breath!

376
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:33,318
Now, now.

377
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:35,045
What's wrong, my dear?

378
00:38:35,698 --> 00:38:37,115
I'm coming.

379
00:38:37,135 --> 00:38:38,552
That's a good baby.

380
00:38:38,827 --> 00:38:40,182
Are you still here?

381
00:38:40,202 --> 00:38:41,557
Get out, right now.

382
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,605
I want to work here!

383
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:47,241
Keep your voice down.

384
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:51,117
I'll be right there, just be patient.

385
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,217
That's a good baby.

386
00:38:53,237 --> 00:38:54,614
There, there.

387
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,917
Please give me a job!

388
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,917
All right, just pipe down.

389
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:04,797
There, there, good baby.

390
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,648
That's your contract.

391
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,655
Sign on the bottom line.

392
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,778
I'll put you to work.

393
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:35,289
But one peep out of you about anything...

394
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,959
and I'll turn you into a piglet.

395
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,627
Should I sign here?

396
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:42,470
Where else?

397
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,322
Quit dilly-dallying.

398
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,134
Unbelievable.

399
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:54,475
What a ridiculous oath I took.

400
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:59,480
I'm bound to give work to whoever asks.

401
00:40:01,618 --> 00:40:02,597
- Finished?

402
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:03,596
- Yes.

403
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,481
- Chihiro, that's your name?

404
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:10,691
- Yes.

405
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,657
Quite a fancy name.

406
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,874
From now on, your name is Sen.

407
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:27,102
Understand?

408
00:40:27,122 --> 00:40:28,082
Sen.

409
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,886
Answer me, Sen!

410
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,429
I understand.

411
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,847
Yes ma'am?

412
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:39,027
- See to her, she's starting work today.

413
00:40:39,047 --> 00:40:41,255
- Very well.

414
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,140
What is your name?

415
00:40:43,993 --> 00:40:45,433
Chi...

416
00:40:45,453 --> 00:40:46,893
I mean, Sen.

417
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,359
Then follow me, Sen.

418
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,207
Haku, I...

419
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,124
No idle chatter.

420
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,669
Call me Master Haku.

421
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,479
I'm afraid even Yubaba can't give an order like that.

422
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,353
Humans aren't allowed here.

423
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,316
She signed the contract.

424
00:41:26,327 --> 00:41:27,517
- What!

425
00:41:27,537 --> 00:41:28,727
- I'll work hard.

426
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,645
- Don't send her to us.

427
00:41:30,665 --> 00:41:32,480
- She stinks to high heaven.

428
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,993
She won't stink after three days of our food.

429
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:40,415
If she doesn't measure up, do with her as you will.

430
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:43,219
Now go back to work.

431
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,407
Where's Lin?

432
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,997
What, you're dumping her on me?

433
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,714
You wanted an assistant.

434
00:41:48,725 --> 00:41:50,267
That's right!

435
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:51,829
Lin's just perfect.

436
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,260
Go, Sen.

437
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,462
Yes sir.

438
00:41:55,064 --> 00:41:56,816
What a pain.

439
00:41:56,836 --> 00:41:58,588
You're gonna pay for this.

440
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,723
Off you go.

441
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,392
Come on.

442
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,733
You pulled it off!

443
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,486
You're so thick, I was worried.

444
00:42:17,712 --> 00:42:19,630
Keep your wits about you.

445
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,568
If you need anything, ask me.

446
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,996
What's wrong?

447
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,000
My legs are shaking.

448
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,586
This is where we live.

449
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,964
Eat, sleep and you'll be fine.

450
00:42:40,777 --> 00:42:41,795
Your apron.

451
00:42:41,815 --> 00:42:42,833
Keep it clean.

452
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,227
Trousers.

453
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,102
You're so puny.

454
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,267
Too big.

455
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,819
Lin, are there...

456
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,945
What?

457
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,198
Are there two Hakus here?

458
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:58,041
Two of that one?

459
00:42:58,061 --> 00:42:59,893
I sure hope not.

460
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,411
Still too big.

461
00:43:01,422 --> 00:43:02,878
He's Yubaba's apprentice.

462
00:43:02,898 --> 00:43:04,354
Be careful around him.

463
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,958
Now where was that...

464
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,836
All right, here we go.

465
00:43:13,976 --> 00:43:16,121
Hey, are you okay?

466
00:43:16,141 --> 00:43:18,286
Don't fall apart on me.

467
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,431
What's all the noise, Lin?

468
00:43:21,442 --> 00:43:22,734
New girl.

469
00:43:22,754 --> 00:43:24,046
Says she feels faint.

470
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:58,078
Meet me at the bridge.

471
00:44:58,098 --> 00:45:00,306
I'll take you to your mother and father.

472
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,697
My shoes are gone.

473
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,626
Thank you.

474
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,537
Follow me.

475
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:57,166
Dad, Mom, it's me!

476
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,997
It's Sen.

477
00:47:59,512 --> 00:48:00,781
Mom!

478
00:48:00,801 --> 00:48:02,070
Dad!

479
00:48:05,017 --> 00:48:06,039
Are they sick?

480
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:07,081
Are they hurt?

481
00:48:07,103 --> 00:48:08,543
They're just sleeping.

482
00:48:08,563 --> 00:48:10,003
Their stomachs are full.

483
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,678
They don't remember they were ever human.

484
00:48:19,115 --> 00:48:20,367
Listen to me!

485
00:48:20,387 --> 00:48:21,639
I promise I'll save you.

486
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:25,023
Don't get too fat or they'll eat you.

487
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,912
Hide these.

488
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,166
I thought they were gone.

489
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,501
For when you go home.

490
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,969
This was a farewell card.

491
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,880
Chihiro?

492
00:48:53,107 --> 00:48:54,734
Chihiro...

493
00:48:54,754 --> 00:48:56,381
That's my name!

494
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:59,895
Yubaba controls us by stealing our names.

495
00:49:00,448 --> 00:49:02,576
You're Sen here.

496
00:49:02,596 --> 00:49:04,724
Keep your real name a secret.

497
00:49:04,827 --> 00:49:06,472
She almost got my name.

498
00:49:06,492 --> 00:49:08,137
I was turning into Sen.

499
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:12,241
Without your real name, you'll never find your way home.

500
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:15,660
I no longer remember mine.

501
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,659
Your real name?

502
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:21,208
But it's strange, I remember yours.

503
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,255
Better eat, you must be hungry.

504
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,915
I don't want to.

505
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:32,303
I put a spell on them to give you back your strength.

506
00:50:08,557 --> 00:50:09,951
You've had a rough time.

507
00:50:09,971 --> 00:50:11,365
Better eat more.

508
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,482
You know the way back.

509
00:50:27,493 --> 00:50:28,910
Thanks Haku.

510
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:30,347
I promise to work hard.

511
00:52:05,132 --> 00:52:06,404
Where were you?

512
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:07,696
I was worried.

513
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,125
Sorry.

514
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,261
Out of the way.

515
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,353
Come on, give it some elbow grease.

516
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:38,447
Starting today, you two are on the big tub.

517
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,583
What?

518
00:52:39,603 --> 00:52:40,646
That's Frog work!

519
00:52:40,668 --> 00:52:42,295
Orders from the top.

520
00:52:42,315 --> 00:52:43,942
And no shirking, either.

521
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,970
Aren't you getting wet?

522
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,604
Sen, come on!

523
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,064
Coming!

524
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,983
I'll leave this open.

525
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:43,794
- On the big tub, Lin?

526
00:53:43,814 --> 00:53:44,878
- Stuff it.

527
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:49,985
Just look at this.

528
00:53:50,005 --> 00:53:51,672
Hasn't been scrubbed in ages.

529
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:09,328
The big tub is reserved for our filthiest guests.

530
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,202
It's caked with sludge.

531
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,169
Lin!

532
00:54:12,189 --> 00:54:13,058
Sen!

533
00:54:13,078 --> 00:54:13,947
First customers are coming.

534
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,668
All right already!

535
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,004
Man, this is pure harassment.

536
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:21,257
Go get a tag from the foreman.

537
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,550
A tag?

538
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,214
For an herbal bath.

539
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,716
Right.

540
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,468
Lin, what's a foreman?

541
00:54:35,532 --> 00:54:37,012
Something's coming.

542
00:54:37,032 --> 00:54:38,512
I wonder...

543
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:51,372
ls some good-for-nothing using the rain to sneak in?

544
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:18,140
Absolutely not, it's too valuable to waste.

545
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,063
Good morning!

546
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,485
Feeling refreshed?

547
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,986
For Kasuga.

548
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,360
One deluxe sulfur bath.

549
00:55:26,542 --> 00:55:27,857
No point standing there.

550
00:55:27,877 --> 00:55:29,192
Back to work.

551
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,035
Scrub it with your hands.

552
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,954
Good morning!

553
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,121
Your bare hands.

554
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,500
But she said it has to be an herbal bath.

555
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,252
You just don't get it.

556
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,421
Mugwort, right?

557
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,715
Relax and enjoy.

558
00:55:52,568 --> 00:55:53,985
Foreman.

559
00:55:54,005 --> 00:55:55,422
Yes ma'am!

560
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,479
Thank you!

561
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,806
But that's not...

562
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,399
Hey you, wait!

563
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,400
What's the trouble?

564
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:04,023
Oh, nothing at all.

565
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,903
We have an intruder.

566
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:06,821
A human?

567
00:56:06,832 --> 00:56:08,414
You figure it out.

568
00:56:08,434 --> 00:56:10,016
Haku's gone today.

569
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,535
Wow, you got a really good one.

570
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:15,285
This goes straight to Kamaji.

571
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:18,708
Water should be right up.

572
00:56:24,558 --> 00:56:26,100
Yank this for hot water.

573
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,662
Go ahead, try it.

574
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,644
You're really are a klutz.

575
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,855
Look at that color.

576
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,354
This one has dried worm salts.

577
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,858
With water this murky, who's gonna see the sludge?

578
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,292
Yank it again when it's full.

579
00:56:50,312 --> 00:56:51,814
It'll stop.

580
00:56:52,085 --> 00:56:53,795
You can let go now.

581
00:56:53,815 --> 00:56:55,525
I'll go get our breakfast.

582
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,989
Okay.

583
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,430
Ouch!

584
00:57:25,285 --> 00:57:26,702
Um...

585
00:57:26,722 --> 00:57:28,139
The bath's not ready yet.

586
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,160
So many...

587
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,786
They're for me?

588
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,412
But I don't need them.

589
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,917
No, you gave me one already.

590
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:05,731
Madam!

591
00:58:05,742 --> 00:58:07,557
- It's a Stink Spirit.

592
00:58:07,577 --> 00:58:09,392
- Yes, and a large one, too.

593
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,278
It's headed straight for the bridge!

594
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,857
Please turn back.

595
00:58:14,376 --> 00:58:16,106
Please go!

596
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:17,856
The baths are closed for the night.

597
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,538
Please withdraw, please!

598
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:23,367
Stinky!

599
00:58:23,385 --> 00:58:25,367
That's odd.

600
00:58:25,387 --> 00:58:27,369
Stink Spirits feel different.

601
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:30,128
Well, now that it's here, better go greet it!

602
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:34,382
All we can do is get rid of it fast.

603
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,721
Everyone, please return to your rooms!

604
00:58:36,732 --> 00:58:37,671
Please hurry.

605
00:58:37,691 --> 00:58:38,630
Terribly sorry!

606
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:42,643
Lin and Sen, Yubaba wants you.

607
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,640
Yes sir!

608
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,397
Pay attention, this is your debut.

609
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:49,397
Show the customer to the big tub.

610
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,395
Remember, one peep out of you and you're coal.

611
00:58:52,456 --> 00:58:53,998
- Got it?

612
00:58:54,018 --> 00:58:55,560
- It has arrived.

613
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,961
No, that's not polite!

614
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:19,472
Welgum to our bazz.

615
00:59:22,652 --> 00:59:23,695
Oh...

616
00:59:23,715 --> 00:59:24,758
Money...!

617
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,438
Hurry Sen, take it!

618
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:28,891
Yez ma'am.

619
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,336
Wud are you wading for?

620
00:59:39,356 --> 00:59:41,692
Show him to da bazz!

621
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,655
Diz way...

622
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,846
Sen!

623
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,641
Horrible!

624
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:12,608
Breakfast!

625
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,903
Open the windows, all of 'em!

626
01:00:57,914 --> 01:00:59,331
What?

627
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:00,768
Just a minute.

628
01:01:06,214 --> 01:01:07,632
- That's really filthy.

629
01:01:07,652 --> 01:01:09,070
- It's not funny.

630
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,875
What will she do?

631
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,798
Ah, she's going to refill the tub.

632
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:21,924
Oh dear, she's soiling the walls with her dirty hands!

633
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,900
Did you give Sen new tags?

634
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:38,729
Never, what a waste!

635
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,647
All that precious herbal essence!

636
01:02:48,525 --> 01:02:49,693
Sen!

637
01:02:49,713 --> 01:02:50,881
Sen, where are you?

638
01:02:50,902 --> 01:02:52,070
- Lin!

639
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:53,258
- Are yo u okay?

640
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,144
I asked Kamaji to help us out.

641
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,775
He's sending his best herbal essence.

642
01:02:58,994 --> 01:03:00,641
Thanks.

643
01:03:00,661 --> 01:03:02,308
There's a thorn or something stuck in him.

644
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,445
A thorn?

645
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,273
I can't pull it out.

646
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:06,710
A thorn?

647
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:08,107
Hmm...

648
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,161
Get everyone downstairs!

649
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,158
Hurry!

650
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,209
Sen and Lin!

651
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,788
Our guest is no Stink Spirit.

652
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:23,382
Use this rope.

653
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:24,675
Yes ma'am!

654
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,928
Tie it good and tight!

655
01:03:36,323 --> 01:03:38,218
Hurry up!

656
01:03:38,238 --> 01:03:40,133
Girls, lend a hand!

657
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:42,148
It's tied!

658
01:03:43,163 --> 01:03:44,894
Everyone ready?

659
01:03:44,914 --> 01:03:46,645
All together now!

660
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,655
Heave!

661
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,153
And heave!

662
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,580
Heave!

663
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,909
Heave!

664
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:05,671
A bicycle?

665
01:04:06,102 --> 01:04:07,872
I knew it.

666
01:04:07,892 --> 01:04:09,662
Now, heave!

667
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:12,424
Heave!

668
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:46,625
Sen, are you all right?

669
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,600
Well done.

670
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:29,957
Gold!

671
01:05:29,977 --> 01:05:31,124
It's gold!

672
01:05:31,146 --> 01:05:32,481
Hands off!

673
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:33,836
That's company property.

674
01:05:33,857 --> 01:05:35,672
Quiet!

675
01:05:35,692 --> 01:05:37,507
Our guest is still with us.

676
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:44,742
Sen, you're in the way.

677
01:05:44,762 --> 01:05:46,305
Get down from there.

678
01:05:46,327 --> 01:05:47,658
Open the main gates!

679
01:05:47,678 --> 01:05:49,009
He's leaving!

680
01:06:15,565 --> 01:06:17,710
Sen, you're a wonder!

681
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:19,875
You made us a fortune.

682
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:23,103
That was the guardian of a great river.

683
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,977
Everyone, learn from Sen!

684
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,558
Sake on the house tonight.

685
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:30,733
Now hand over all that gold you picked up.

686
01:06:44,177 --> 01:06:45,258
Want some?

687
01:06:45,278 --> 01:06:46,359
I swiped them.

688
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,212
Thanks.

689
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:50,586
What a day.

690
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:54,426
Haku missed the whole thing.

691
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,504
Not Haku again!

692
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:59,800
Sometimes he just disappears.

693
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:03,936
They say Yubaba makes him do bad stuff.

694
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:04,895
Really?

695
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:06,396
Lights out, Lin.

696
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,644
Okay.

697
01:07:32,642 --> 01:07:34,039
There's a town.

698
01:07:34,059 --> 01:07:35,456
And the water's like an ocean.

699
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,672
What did you expect after all that rain?

700
01:07:40,316 --> 01:07:42,399
I'm gonna get there someday.

701
01:07:42,419 --> 01:07:44,502
I'll get out of here for sure.

702
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,336
What's wrong?

703
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,401
Gold!

704
01:08:44,047 --> 01:08:45,590
Who are you?

705
01:08:45,610 --> 01:08:47,153
You're no customer.

706
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:49,117
You're not allowed in there.

707
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:57,120
Hey, it's gold!

708
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:58,910
For me?

709
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:06,559
You can make gold?

710
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,065
Gimme!

711
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:22,992
Who's down here?

712
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,404
It's way past lights out.

713
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:33,168
Hey boss, I'm hungry.

714
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,378
Starved, in fact.

715
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,379
That voice...

716
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,503
There, I'll pay you now.

717
01:09:38,059 --> 01:09:39,415
I'm a customer.

718
01:09:39,435 --> 01:09:40,791
I want a bath.

719
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:42,629
Wake everyone up!

720
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:51,395
Mom and Dad, the river guardian gave me this medicine.

721
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:54,475
If you take it, you'll be people again.

722
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,605
Dad, Mom, where are you?

723
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,232
Daddy!

724
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,498
What an awful dream.

725
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,292
Lin?

726
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:23,006
Where is everybody?

727
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:32,307
Wow, it really did turn into an ocean!

728
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:40,562
I can see where Mom and Dad are from here.

729
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,158
Kamaji lit the fires already.

730
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,282
Did I sleep that long?

731
01:10:51,758 --> 01:10:53,301
The customer's waiting.

732
01:10:53,321 --> 01:10:54,864
Can't you work faster?

733
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:59,081
Serve everything you've got, even leftovers!

734
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,882
Sen!

735
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,084
Lin?

736
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:06,045
I was just coming to wake you up, look!

737
01:11:06,105 --> 01:11:07,311
Gold!

738
01:11:07,331 --> 01:11:08,537
He gave me real gold.

739
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,849
We've got a real high roller.

740
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,428
Please, sir, try this!

741
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,184
Throw us some gold!

742
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:25,531
I'm starving, bring it all!

743
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,446
Who's this guest?

744
01:11:31,547 --> 01:11:33,317
Come on, Yubaba's still asleep.

745
01:11:33,337 --> 01:11:35,107
Now's your chance.

746
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,451
I'm going to see Kamaji.

747
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,128
I wouldn't go there now.

748
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,506
He's angry because they woke him up.

749
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:44,550
Lin, let's go back for more.

750
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:13,079
What if I can't recognize my parents?

751
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:16,657
I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

752
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:46,437
That's the dragon I saw.

753
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:48,439
It's coming this way.

754
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,493
Those aren't birds!

755
01:13:03,681 --> 01:13:05,326
Haku, don't give up.

756
01:13:05,346 --> 01:13:06,991
Over here!

757
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,676
Haku!

758
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:30,235
It's just paper.

759
01:13:58,319 --> 01:13:59,486
Haku?

760
01:13:59,506 --> 01:14:00,673
It is you, isn't it?

761
01:14:06,661 --> 01:14:08,351
Are you hurt?

762
01:14:08,371 --> 01:14:10,061
Those paper birds are gone.

763
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,568
You're safe now.

764
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,495
He's going to Yubaba.

765
01:14:26,889 --> 01:14:28,204
What should I do?

766
01:14:28,224 --> 01:14:29,539
He'll die!

767
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:41,765
Now the richest man in the whole wide world...

768
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:46,144
has come to grace us with his presence.

769
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,025
Greetings!

770
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:52,571
Now let us appeal to his generosity.

771
01:14:52,665 --> 01:14:53,769
Please, sir!

772
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:54,893
Over here.

773
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,452
I hope I get some.

774
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,655
They say gold springs from his palms.

775
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:05,580
Toss some this way, sir!

776
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,880
What are you doing?

777
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:11,965
Going upstairs.

778
01:15:11,976 --> 01:15:13,080
No you don't.

779
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:14,204
What's this?

780
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,171
Blood!

781
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,343
Out of the way, we have a guest.

782
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:25,726
Thank you for your help.

783
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,519
Get out of the way!

784
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:52,127
I don't need it.

785
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:57,386
I'm busy, please excuse me.

786
01:16:08,824 --> 01:16:10,344
Quiet!

787
01:16:10,364 --> 01:16:11,884
Quiet down.

788
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,232
Back, get back!

789
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:16,696
Please excuse her manners.

790
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:20,447
The girl is new and a human.

791
01:16:22,797 --> 01:16:24,174
What's so funny?

792
01:16:24,194 --> 01:16:25,571
Wipe off that smile.

793
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:27,166
Why, I would never...

794
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:34,457
He ate them!

795
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:02,629
Yubaba!

796
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:18,121
We're in a fine mess now.

797
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:20,797
He's a No Face.

798
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,966
That's right, a No Face!

799
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:26,174
Your greed attracted quite a guest.

800
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:29,924
Don't do anything stupid until I get down there.

801
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,809
Just look at this carpet.

802
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:35,186
Get Haku out of here.

803
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:37,264
He's useless to me now.

804
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:02,840
Bo, sleeping outside your crib again?

805
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:10,847
Oh I'm sorry, you were sleeping like such a good baby.

806
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:13,972
Baba still has work to do.

807
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:19,686
Go back to sleep now, that's a good baby.

808
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,632
Ouch, let me go!

809
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:51,846
Oh, thanks for helping me.

810
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:55,266
But I'm in a hurry, please let me go.

811
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,811
You came to make me sick.

812
01:20:58,145 --> 01:21:00,939
The outside has bad germs.

813
01:21:01,617 --> 01:21:03,637
I'm a human.

814
01:21:03,657 --> 01:21:05,677
Maybe you never saw one before.

815
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:08,154
You'll get sick out there.

816
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:10,406
Stay here and play with me.

817
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:12,075
Are you sick?

818
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:15,036
I'm in here 'cause I'll get sick outside.

819
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:17,622
Staying inside will make you sick!

820
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:21,501
You see, someone I really care about is badly hurt.

821
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:23,252
I've got to go right now.

822
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,830
Please let me go.

823
01:21:24,848 --> 01:21:27,476
If you go, I'll start crying.

824
01:21:27,496 --> 01:21:30,124
Then Baba will come and kill you.

825
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,969
I'll break your little arm.

826
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,262
You're hurting me!

827
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:35,932
Please, I'll come play with you later.

828
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:37,726
No, I wanna play now!

829
01:21:41,532 --> 01:21:42,303
Blood!

830
01:21:42,323 --> 01:21:43,094
See?

831
01:21:43,114 --> 01:21:43,885
It's blood!

832
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:56,987
Haku!

833
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:59,330
Go away!

834
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:00,623
It's you, isn't it?

835
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:02,167
Hang on!

836
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:03,501
Be quiet!

837
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:04,828
Haku!

838
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,593
Go away!

839
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:15,597
No!

840
01:22:30,497 --> 01:22:32,437
I'm not afraid of blood.

841
01:22:32,457 --> 01:22:34,397
I'll cry if you don't play.

842
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:36,451
Please be a good boy and wait.

843
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:39,868
If you don't play with me I'll cry...

844
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,166
Please, wait!

845
01:22:43,177 --> 01:22:44,907
What a racket.

846
01:22:44,927 --> 01:22:46,657
Simmer down.

847
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:50,377
You're a little butterball, aren't you?

848
01:22:58,015 --> 01:23:00,349
I am a bit transparent here.

849
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,392
Baba...

850
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:05,977
Oh dear, can't you even tell me from your own mother?

851
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:16,991
There, that gives you a little more freedom.

852
01:23:17,002 --> 01:23:18,732
Let's see now.

853
01:23:18,752 --> 01:23:20,482
What shall we turn you into?

854
01:23:38,315 --> 01:23:39,712
This is our little secret.

855
01:23:39,732 --> 01:23:41,129
If you tell anyone...

856
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:43,389
I'll do the same to you.

857
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:46,062
Who are you?

858
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:48,564
Yubaba's older twin sister.

859
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:52,485
Thanks to you I've had a nice tour of the place.

860
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:54,654
Now hand over the dragon.

861
01:23:54,706 --> 01:23:55,975
What are you going to do?

862
01:23:55,995 --> 01:23:57,264
He needs help.

863
01:23:57,417 --> 01:23:59,044
That dragon's a thief.

864
01:23:59,064 --> 01:24:00,691
He works for my sister.

865
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:03,829
He stole a valuable seal from my house.

866
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,296
Haku would never do that.

867
01:24:05,316 --> 01:24:06,772
He's too kind.

868
01:24:07,094 --> 01:24:08,909
All dragons are kind.

869
01:24:08,929 --> 01:24:10,744
Kind and stupid...

870
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:15,551
and eager to learn my sister's magical ways.

871
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:19,554
This boy will do anything that greedy woman wants.

872
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,806
Now step aside.

873
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:24,433
It's too late for him anyway.

874
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:27,687
The thing he stole had a protection spell.

875
01:24:27,688 --> 01:24:30,016
Now the thief will die.

876
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:32,480
No, don't!

877
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,909
What are you up to now?

878
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,337
All right, that's enough.

879
01:24:43,357 --> 01:24:44,774
Back to your room.

880
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:54,502
Oh dear, that was careless...

881
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,383
Haku, no!

882
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:18,988
Haku!

883
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:48,517
What is this?

884
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:50,186
Hold on there!

885
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:54,436
Haku!

886
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:59,487
Does it hurt?

887
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:05,236
This is serious.

888
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,412
Haku, don't give up.

889
01:26:08,423 --> 01:26:09,402
What can we do?

890
01:26:09,422 --> 01:26:10,401
He'll die!

891
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:13,542
Something inside him is eating him up.

892
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:14,752
Inside him?

893
01:26:14,763 --> 01:26:16,515
It's a strong spell.

894
01:26:16,535 --> 01:26:18,287
There's nothing I can do.

895
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:21,801
Haku, the river guardian gave me this.

896
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:24,175
Eat it, maybe it will help.

897
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:28,676
Haku, open your mouth.

898
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,519
Please Haku, eat it.

899
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:35,061
See, it's safe.

900
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:37,442
Is it some kind of medicine?

901
01:26:37,494 --> 01:26:39,099
Open your mouth.

902
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:40,724
You can do it.

903
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,200
That's it.

904
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,823
Swallow it.

905
01:27:06,022 --> 01:27:06,790
He spit something out.

906
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:07,578
That's it!

907
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:21,485
The seal!

908
01:27:21,496 --> 01:27:22,157
It's getting away.

909
01:27:22,177 --> 01:27:22,838
There!

910
01:27:22,858 --> 01:27:23,519
Over there!

911
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:45,923
Sen, we have to purge the spell.

912
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:50,931
Begone!

913
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,931
Haku took this from Yubaba's sister.

914
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:55,487
From Zeniba?

915
01:27:55,507 --> 01:27:56,924
That's a witch's seal.

916
01:27:57,147 --> 01:27:59,475
Precious loot, I'd say.

917
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:03,903
I knew it was Haku.

918
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:05,697
Kamaji, it's Haku!

919
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:08,824
Haku!

920
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,527
Haku, Haku!

921
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:14,747
Kamaji, he's not breathing.

922
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:18,543
He is, but he's still very ill from the spell.

923
01:28:27,594 --> 01:28:30,798
That should calm him some.

924
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:38,020
Haku turned up one day, just like you.

925
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:41,065
He said he wanted to learn magic.

926
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:43,275
I tried to warn him.

927
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:47,151
Becoming a sorcerer's apprentice is dangerous business.

928
01:28:47,457 --> 01:28:48,749
But he wouldn't listen.

929
01:28:48,769 --> 01:28:50,061
He kept saying...

930
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:51,867
that he'd lost his home.

931
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:55,618
So he signed up to be Yubaba's apprentice.

932
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:59,124
He got paler and paler as time went by...

933
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:02,249
and got a sharp gleam in his eye.

934
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:08,217
Kamaji, I'm going to give this back to Zeniba.

935
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:12,054
Give it back, apologize, and ask her to help Haku.

936
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:14,178
Tell me how to get there.

937
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:16,935
To Zeniba's house?

938
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:19,186
That's one scary sorceress.

939
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,183
Please.

940
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,323
Haku helped me.

941
01:29:22,343 --> 01:29:24,426
Now I want to help him.

942
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:29,238
Well, getting there is one thing.

943
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:31,362
Getting back's the problem.

944
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:33,443
Wait a minute.

945
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:39,207
Let's see now, they're here somewhere...

946
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:42,961
Everyone, I need my shoes and clothes.

947
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,686
Sen!

948
01:29:52,706 --> 01:29:54,288
I've been hunting for you everywhere!

949
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:57,892
Lin...

950
01:29:57,903 --> 01:29:59,320
Haku?

951
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:00,757
What happened here?

952
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:02,472
Who are those guys?

953
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:04,940
My new friends.

954
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:05,858
Right?

955
01:30:05,911 --> 01:30:07,578
Yubaba's looking for you.

956
01:30:07,598 --> 01:30:09,265
She's hopping mad.

957
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:13,109
That big tipper turned out to be a No Face.

958
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:15,989
Yubaba says you let him in.

959
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:20,581
She might be right.

960
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:22,791
What, are you serious?

961
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:24,543
I thought he was a customer.

962
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:27,918
He's already swallowed three of our people!

963
01:30:28,141 --> 01:30:29,723
Found them.

964
01:30:29,743 --> 01:30:31,325
Here they are, Sen.

965
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:33,302
We're busy, gramps.

966
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:35,096
You can use these.

967
01:30:36,316 --> 01:30:37,755
Train tickets?

968
01:30:37,775 --> 01:30:39,214
Where'd you get those?

969
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:41,810
Leftovers from 40 years ago.

970
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:45,766
You get off at the sixth stop, called Swamp Bottom.

971
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:47,024
Swamp Bottom?

972
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:49,068
That's right, the sixth stop.

973
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:50,270
Six.

974
01:30:50,455 --> 01:30:52,290
Make sure you get it right.

975
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:54,145
There used to be a return train...

976
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:56,158
but these days it's one way only.

977
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,952
Still want to go?

978
01:30:57,953 --> 01:31:01,373
Yes, I'll walk back along the tracks.

979
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:04,750
What about Yubaba?

980
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,203
I'll talk to her now.

981
01:31:06,846 --> 01:31:08,826
Haku, I promise I'll be back.

982
01:31:08,846 --> 01:31:10,826
Please don't die.

983
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:13,130
What's going on here?

984
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,835
Don't you understand?

985
01:31:14,855 --> 01:31:16,170
It's love.

986
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:26,355
It just keeps getting bigger!

987
01:31:26,366 --> 01:31:27,760
- Don't let it eat me!

988
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:29,174
- Here she comes.

989
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:38,117
Thank goodness, Sen!

990
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:40,537
Yubaba can't control him.

991
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:45,553
There's no need to get upset.

992
01:31:45,573 --> 01:31:47,576
Sen will be here soon.

993
01:31:47,804 --> 01:31:49,135
Where's Sen?

994
01:31:49,155 --> 01:31:50,486
I want Sen!

995
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,457
Now hurry!

996
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:59,638
Yubaba, it's Sen.

997
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:01,140
Where were you?

998
01:32:01,151 --> 01:32:03,444
Sen is here, honored guest.

999
01:32:03,464 --> 01:32:05,757
She'll be right with you.

1000
01:32:06,614 --> 01:32:08,241
What took you so long?

1001
01:32:08,261 --> 01:32:09,888
This is a total disaster!

1002
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:12,943
Win him over and take all his gold.

1003
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:19,158
What's this filthy rat?

1004
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:23,363
Don't you recognize him?

1005
01:32:23,423 --> 01:32:24,879
Of course not.

1006
01:32:24,899 --> 01:32:26,355
How disgusting.

1007
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:27,951
Now in you go.

1008
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:31,705
Have a nice time.

1009
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:34,875
Will she be all right?

1010
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:36,967
Want to take her place?

1011
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,654
Try this, it's yummy.

1012
01:33:02,337 --> 01:33:04,670
Want some gold?

1013
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:07,023
I've decided it's just for you.

1014
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:12,711
Come over here.

1015
01:33:12,722 --> 01:33:14,617
What do you want?

1016
01:33:14,637 --> 01:33:16,532
You can tell me.

1017
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:18,717
Where did you come from?

1018
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:21,296
There's someplace I have to go right away.

1019
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:26,141
You should go home.

1020
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:29,312
You can't give me what I want.

1021
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:32,572
Where's your home?

1022
01:33:32,592 --> 01:33:34,174
You must have a mom and dad.

1023
01:33:34,828 --> 01:33:36,558
No...

1024
01:33:36,578 --> 01:33:38,308
No...

1025
01:33:39,082 --> 01:33:41,040
I'm lonely...

1026
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:43,018
So lonely...

1027
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:45,362
Are you lost?

1028
01:33:45,547 --> 01:33:47,402
Sen...

1029
01:33:47,422 --> 01:33:49,277
I want Sen.

1030
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:51,033
Take the gold.

1031
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:52,668
Would you eat me?

1032
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:53,585
Take it.

1033
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:54,662
Take it!

1034
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:06,640
Before you eat me, eat this first.

1035
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:11,271
I was saving it for my parents, but you can have it.

1036
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:33,497
Sen!

1037
01:34:35,763 --> 01:34:37,721
You little wench!

1038
01:34:37,741 --> 01:34:39,699
What did you feed me?

1039
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,315
Watch out!

1040
01:34:57,275 --> 01:34:59,318
Not in my house!

1041
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,162
I'm over here!

1042
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:16,294
Here!

1043
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:02,711
You'll pay for this!

1044
01:36:19,983 --> 01:36:22,231
Sen, down here!

1045
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:40,752
Over here!

1046
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:42,626
We don't need him.

1047
01:36:46,436 --> 01:36:48,229
He needs to get out of there.

1048
01:36:48,249 --> 01:36:50,042
It's bad for him.

1049
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:52,347
But where do we take him?

1050
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:53,432
I don't know.

1051
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,055
Don't know?

1052
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:58,138
Great, now he's following us.

1053
01:37:15,465 --> 01:37:16,550
- From here you walk.

1054
01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:17,655
- Okay.

1055
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:19,541
You'll find the station.

1056
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:21,164
Thanks.

1057
01:37:21,586 --> 01:37:23,413
Be sure to come back!

1058
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:24,622
I will.

1059
01:37:28,603 --> 01:37:30,396
Sen!

1060
01:37:30,416 --> 01:37:32,209
I said you were a klutz.

1061
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:33,923
I take it back!

1062
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:46,315
No Face, hurt her and you'll get it from me!

1063
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:50,948
There it is.

1064
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:04,871
The train's coming, let's hurry.

1065
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:30,605
To Swamp Bottom, please.

1066
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:38,867
You want to come too?

1067
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:42,366
One more, please.

1068
01:39:22,707 --> 01:39:24,250
Sit down.

1069
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:26,540
Behave yourself, okay?

1070
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:30,167
Kamaji.

1071
01:41:32,346 --> 01:41:33,681
Oh, Haku.

1072
01:41:33,701 --> 01:41:35,036
You're awake.

1073
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,794
Kamaji, where's Sen?

1074
01:41:37,018 --> 01:41:38,395
What happened?

1075
01:41:38,415 --> 01:41:39,792
Please tell me.

1076
01:41:39,844 --> 01:41:42,923
Don't you remember anything?

1077
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:45,599
Just fragments.

1078
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,895
Chihiro kept calling my name in the darkness.

1079
01:41:48,978 --> 01:41:53,183
I followed her voice and woke up here.

1080
01:41:53,367 --> 01:41:55,888
Chihiro?

1081
01:41:55,908 --> 01:41:58,429
So her name is Chihiro.

1082
01:41:59,498 --> 01:42:01,018
Wonderful...

1083
01:42:01,038 --> 01:42:02,558
It's the power of love.

1084
01:42:06,037 --> 01:42:09,247
This gold will hardly cover the damage.

1085
01:42:09,258 --> 01:42:10,800
That fool, Sen!

1086
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:12,362
She just cost me a fortune.

1087
01:42:12,668 --> 01:42:16,504
But we were saved, thanks to her.

1088
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:17,756
Silence!

1089
01:42:17,757 --> 01:42:20,300
She started the whole thing.

1090
01:42:20,301 --> 01:42:22,719
Now she's run away.

1091
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,594
Abandoned her own parents!

1092
01:42:26,067 --> 01:42:28,070
They must be fat enough.

1093
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:30,093
Turn them into bacon or ham.

1094
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:32,054
No, wait.

1095
01:42:33,022 --> 01:42:34,272
Master Haku!

1096
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:36,726
What, you're still alive?

1097
01:42:38,913 --> 01:42:40,683
You still don't see it?

1098
01:42:40,703 --> 01:42:42,473
She's played a trick on you.

1099
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:45,700
You've gotten pretty fresh.

1100
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:48,370
Since when do you talk that way?

1101
01:43:39,797 --> 01:43:41,965
Bo?

1102
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:49,514
Bo!

1103
01:43:49,515 --> 01:43:50,640
Pebbles!

1104
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:53,640
Bo!

1105
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:57,982
Where are you, Bo?

1106
01:43:58,107 --> 01:44:00,935
Please come out.

1107
01:44:01,444 --> 01:44:02,941
Bo!

1108
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:08,488
Bo?

1109
01:44:13,122 --> 01:44:17,668
Why, you little...

1110
01:44:18,919 --> 01:44:22,248
Out with it!

1111
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:27,837
Where did you hide my Bo?

1112
01:44:28,137 --> 01:44:30,054
He's with Zeniba.

1113
01:44:30,055 --> 01:44:32,223
Zeniba?

1114
01:44:53,047 --> 01:44:54,924
Now I understand.

1115
01:44:54,944 --> 01:44:56,821
That evil witch.

1116
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:59,751
She thinks she's beaten me.

1117
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:03,665
So, what's your plan?

1118
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:06,174
I'll bring him back.

1119
01:45:06,175 --> 01:45:10,553
But you must send Sen and her parents back to their world.

1120
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:13,177
And what about you?

1121
01:45:13,224 --> 01:45:17,179
Maybe I'll send them back and then tear you to pieces.

1122
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:05,768
I think this is right.

1123
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:08,232
Come on.

1124
01:46:34,847 --> 01:46:36,720
You can ride on my shoulder.

1125
01:47:55,177 --> 01:47:56,799
Come in.

1126
01:48:01,767 --> 01:48:03,765
Thank you.

1127
01:48:05,521 --> 01:48:08,144
Well, hurry up then.

1128
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:09,937
Come on.

1129
01:48:13,028 --> 01:48:14,988
So you all made it.

1130
01:48:14,999 --> 01:48:16,251
- I...

1131
01:48:16,271 --> 01:48:17,523
- Have a seat.

1132
01:48:17,533 --> 01:48:19,986
I'll make some tea.

1133
01:48:25,634 --> 01:48:27,842
Zeniba, Haku stole this.

1134
01:48:27,862 --> 01:48:30,070
I came to give it back.

1135
01:48:33,132 --> 01:48:35,801
Do you know what this is?

1136
01:48:35,884 --> 01:48:38,928
No, but I know it's very precious.

1137
01:48:38,939 --> 01:48:40,834
I'm here to apologize for him.

1138
01:48:40,854 --> 01:48:42,749
He's sorry.

1139
01:48:43,434 --> 01:48:46,602
You held this and nothing happened to you?

1140
01:48:46,603 --> 01:48:47,645
What?

1141
01:48:47,646 --> 01:48:50,645
Wait, the protection spell is gone.

1142
01:48:51,577 --> 01:48:53,204
I'm sorry.

1143
01:48:53,224 --> 01:48:54,851
There was this strange bug.

1144
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:56,905
I squashed it.

1145
01:48:57,239 --> 01:48:59,567
Squashed it!

1146
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:04,871
My sister snuck that bug into the dragon...

1147
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:07,665
so she could control him.

1148
01:49:07,666 --> 01:49:10,494
And you squashed it!

1149
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,797
Now then, sit down.

1150
01:49:14,808 --> 01:49:16,390
You must be No Face.

1151
01:49:16,410 --> 01:49:17,992
You sit, too.

1152
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:22,555
Please turn them back into themselves.

1153
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:25,767
Why my dear, the spell's long broken.

1154
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:28,346
They can change back any time.

1155
01:49:35,444 --> 01:49:39,405
Yubaba and I are two halves of a whole, but we don't get along.

1156
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:42,116
You know what bad taste she has.

1157
01:49:42,117 --> 01:49:45,366
Sorceress twins are just a recipe for trouble.

1158
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:53,795
I'd like to help you dear, but there's nothing I can do.

1159
01:49:53,796 --> 01:49:56,044
It's one of our rules here.

1160
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:59,425
You'll have to save your parents and your dragon boyfriend...

1161
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:01,177
all by yourself.

1162
01:50:01,178 --> 01:50:04,302
But can't you even give me a hint?

1163
01:50:04,473 --> 01:50:08,101
I feel like Haku and I met a long time ago.

1164
01:50:08,102 --> 01:50:10,304
In that case it's easy.

1165
01:50:10,395 --> 01:50:13,064
Everything that happens stays inside you...

1166
01:50:13,065 --> 01:50:15,518
even if you can't remember it.

1167
01:50:16,662 --> 01:50:18,414
It's already late.

1168
01:50:18,434 --> 01:50:20,186
Why don't you stay the night?

1169
01:50:20,405 --> 01:50:23,404
You boys give me a hand.

1170
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:31,533
Come on, keep at it.

1171
01:50:34,346 --> 01:50:35,660
See?

1172
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:36,994
You have a talent for this.

1173
01:50:37,005 --> 01:50:38,832
You're a big help.

1174
01:50:39,424 --> 01:50:42,878
It's not the same when you use magic.

1175
01:50:44,022 --> 01:50:46,275
Pull it through there.

1176
01:50:46,295 --> 01:50:48,548
Now do it again.

1177
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:51,387
Zeniba, I'm going back after all.

1178
01:50:51,854 --> 01:50:55,523
Haku could die while I'm sitting here.

1179
01:50:55,524 --> 01:50:59,228
And they might eat my mom and dad!

1180
01:51:01,196 --> 01:51:04,073
Wait just a little longer.

1181
01:51:04,074 --> 01:51:05,821
There we are.

1182
01:51:06,451 --> 01:51:08,619
Use it to tie back your hair.

1183
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:14,701
It's pretty.

1184
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:17,263
It'll protect you.

1185
01:51:17,283 --> 01:51:19,826
I made it from the thread we spun.

1186
01:51:19,882 --> 01:51:21,379
Thank you.

1187
01:51:30,736 --> 01:51:32,676
What good timing.

1188
01:51:32,696 --> 01:51:34,636
We've got another guest, let him in.

1189
01:51:34,646 --> 01:51:35,972
Sure.

1190
01:51:49,077 --> 01:51:50,403
Haku!

1191
01:51:51,413 --> 01:51:52,785
Haku...

1192
01:51:53,415 --> 01:51:55,208
I'm so glad to see you.

1193
01:51:55,344 --> 01:51:56,659
Are you okay?

1194
01:51:56,679 --> 01:51:57,994
Do you feel all right?

1195
01:51:58,086 --> 01:51:59,287
Thank goodness.

1196
01:52:00,923 --> 01:52:03,376
Good timing, I'd say.

1197
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:06,511
Zeniba, Haku's alive.

1198
01:52:06,845 --> 01:52:11,098
Haku, I no longer blame you for what you did.

1199
01:52:11,099 --> 01:52:14,678
But be sure to protect this girl.

1200
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:17,897
Okay boys, time you went home.

1201
01:52:17,898 --> 01:52:20,146
Come see me again soon.

1202
01:52:20,692 --> 01:52:25,238
You stay with me and be my helper.

1203
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:28,699
Zeniba!

1204
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:31,410
Thank you, I'm going now.

1205
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:34,622
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll manage just fine.

1206
01:52:34,623 --> 01:52:37,959
My real name is Chihiro.

1207
01:52:37,970 --> 01:52:39,263
Chihiro?

1208
01:52:39,283 --> 01:52:40,576
What a nice name.

1209
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:42,588
Take good care of it.

1210
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:43,381
I will!

1211
01:52:43,382 --> 01:52:45,380
Now off you go.

1212
01:52:46,895 --> 01:52:48,522
Thank you, Zeniba.

1213
01:52:48,542 --> 01:52:50,169
Goodbye!

1214
01:53:39,021 --> 01:53:40,723
Haku, listen.

1215
01:53:40,856 --> 01:53:44,686
I don't remember this, but my mom told me about it.

1216
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:48,690
Once when I was little, I fell in a river.

1217
01:53:48,957 --> 01:53:50,852
Now it's all built over.

1218
01:53:50,872 --> 01:53:52,767
It flows underground.

1219
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:55,279
But I just remembered.

1220
01:53:56,204 --> 01:53:58,077
The river was called...

1221
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:01,619
it was called the Kohaku River.

1222
01:54:02,044 --> 01:54:05,248
Your real name is Kohaku.

1223
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:28,235
Chihiro, thank you!

1224
01:54:28,236 --> 01:54:31,690
My name is Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

1225
01:54:31,917 --> 01:54:33,585
- Nigihayami?

1226
01:54:33,605 --> 01:54:35,273
- Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

1227
01:54:35,295 --> 01:54:36,735
What a name!

1228
01:54:36,755 --> 01:54:38,195
Sounds like a guardian spirit.

1229
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:42,875
I remember how you fell into me as a child.

1230
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:44,794
You were chasing your shoe.

1231
01:54:44,795 --> 01:54:49,341
Yes, and you carried me to shallow water.

1232
01:54:50,008 --> 01:54:51,460
I'm so happy...

1233
01:55:24,042 --> 01:55:25,664
They're back!

1234
01:55:38,807 --> 01:55:41,635
You brought Bo back with you?

1235
01:55:44,312 --> 01:55:45,354
Baba!

1236
01:55:45,365 --> 01:55:46,887
Bo!

1237
01:55:46,907 --> 01:55:48,429
You're not hurt?

1238
01:55:48,449 --> 01:55:49,971
What a terrible time you had.

1239
01:55:51,027 --> 01:55:54,356
Bo, when did you learn to stand on your own?

1240
01:55:54,739 --> 01:55:56,862
Yubaba, remember your promise.

1241
01:55:56,908 --> 01:56:00,112
Send Chihiro and her parents back to their world.

1242
01:56:00,328 --> 01:56:02,872
Sorry, but it's not that simple.

1243
01:56:02,873 --> 01:56:06,202
This world has rules, you know.

1244
01:56:06,626 --> 01:56:07,918
Silence!

1245
01:56:07,929 --> 01:56:09,323
Just do it, Baba.

1246
01:56:09,343 --> 01:56:10,737
Don't be so mean.

1247
01:56:10,839 --> 01:56:13,633
Baby had such a good time.

1248
01:56:13,925 --> 01:56:16,802
But I'm just following the rule.

1249
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:19,381
Otherwise I can't break the spell.

1250
01:56:19,431 --> 01:56:22,760
If you make Sen cry, I won't like you anymore.

1251
01:56:22,851 --> 01:56:24,310
But...

1252
01:56:24,311 --> 01:56:25,683
Granny!

1253
01:56:25,687 --> 01:56:27,264
Granny?

1254
01:56:27,397 --> 01:56:29,224
I'll do as you ask.

1255
01:56:40,869 --> 01:56:43,120
Haku told me about the rule.

1256
01:56:43,121 --> 01:56:45,119
Well, you've got guts.

1257
01:56:45,133 --> 01:56:46,823
I brought your contract.

1258
01:56:46,843 --> 01:56:48,533
Follow me.

1259
01:56:48,543 --> 01:56:50,791
This won't take a minute, Bo.

1260
01:56:51,588 --> 01:56:53,290
Don't worry.

1261
01:56:57,552 --> 01:57:01,598
See if you can pick out your parents for me.

1262
01:57:10,732 --> 01:57:12,274
You get one guess.

1263
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:15,149
Pick them out and you all go free.

1264
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,698
Granny, I can't do it.

1265
01:57:28,718 --> 01:57:30,616
Dad and Mom aren't here.

1266
01:57:30,637 --> 01:57:32,514
Not here?

1267
01:57:32,534 --> 01:57:34,411
Is that your answer?

1268
01:57:35,757 --> 01:57:37,004
Yes.

1269
01:57:39,594 --> 01:57:43,055
You're right!

1270
01:57:43,066 --> 01:57:44,381
Attagirl!

1271
01:57:44,401 --> 01:57:45,716
Good for you.

1272
01:57:49,479 --> 01:57:50,771
Thank you everyone.

1273
01:57:50,782 --> 01:57:52,489
All right!

1274
01:57:52,509 --> 01:57:54,216
You win, just get out of here.

1275
01:57:54,526 --> 01:57:56,649
Thanks for everything.

1276
01:57:56,987 --> 01:57:58,689
Goodbye.

1277
01:57:58,947 --> 01:58:00,114
Thank you.

1278
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:01,692
See you soon.

1279
01:58:01,793 --> 01:58:02,749
- Haku!

1280
01:58:02,769 --> 01:58:03,725
- Let's go.

1281
01:58:04,202 --> 01:58:05,536
Where's Mom and Dad?

1282
01:58:05,537 --> 01:58:07,034
They went on ahead.

1283
01:58:14,379 --> 01:58:15,629
The water's gone.

1284
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:17,582
I can't go any further.

1285
01:58:17,799 --> 01:58:20,301
Go back the way you came.

1286
01:58:20,302 --> 01:58:23,554
But don't look back until you're out of the tunnel.

1287
01:58:23,555 --> 01:58:25,849
But what about you?

1288
01:58:26,057 --> 01:58:28,976
I'll tell Yubaba I'm quitting my apprenticeship.

1289
01:58:28,987 --> 01:58:30,342
I'm fine now.

1290
01:58:30,362 --> 01:58:31,717
I have my name back.

1291
01:58:32,063 --> 01:58:33,981
Now I can go home too.

1292
01:58:33,982 --> 01:58:35,482
Will we meet again somewhere?

1293
01:58:35,493 --> 01:58:36,286
- I'm sure of it.

1294
01:58:36,306 --> 01:58:37,099
- Promise?

1295
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:38,068
Promise.

1296
01:58:38,069 --> 01:58:40,567
Now go, and don't look back.

1297
01:59:03,428 --> 01:59:05,221
Chihiro!

1298
01:59:05,357 --> 01:59:06,774
Where have you been?

1299
01:59:06,794 --> 01:59:08,211
Hurry up.

1300
01:59:11,529 --> 01:59:12,489
Mom!

1301
01:59:12,509 --> 01:59:13,469
Dad!

1302
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,356
Don't go running off like that.

1303
01:59:15,357 --> 01:59:16,558
Let's go.

1304
01:59:17,025 --> 01:59:19,360
Mom, are you really okay?

1305
01:59:19,361 --> 01:59:23,816
Hurry, the moving van will be there.

1306
01:59:33,041 --> 01:59:35,460
Hurry up, Chihiro.

1307
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:45,844
Watch your step.

1308
01:59:45,855 --> 01:59:47,607
Chihiro, don't cling.

1309
01:59:47,627 --> 01:59:49,379
You'll make me trip.

1310
02:00:01,403 --> 02:00:03,071
The end of the tunnel.

1311
02:00:03,238 --> 02:00:04,690
Hey!

1312
02:00:04,823 --> 02:00:06,400
What is it?

1313
02:00:06,783 --> 02:00:09,111
Will you look at that.

1314
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:12,367
It's all dusty inside, too.

1315
02:00:12,590 --> 02:00:13,592
- Is this somebody's joke?

1316
02:00:13,612 --> 02:00:14,614
- I wonder...

1317
02:00:14,624 --> 02:00:17,247
I told you not to stop here.

1318
02:00:22,757 --> 02:00:25,460
That's it, you're fine.

1319
02:00:26,511 --> 02:00:28,887
We're off, Chihiro.

1320
02:00:28,898 --> 02:00:30,338
Chihiro!

1321
02:00:30,358 --> 02:00:31,798
Hurry up!

1322
02:00:56,916 --> 02:04:26,200
