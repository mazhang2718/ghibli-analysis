00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:18,967
Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DYMP, Walt Disney Japan, Mitsubishi, Toho and KDDI present THE WIND RISES The wind is rising!

2
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:30,728
We must try to live.

3
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,633
Here it is.

4
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,848
May I borrow it?

5
00:05:08,193 --> 00:05:09,423
- It's in English.

6
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,673
- I have a dictionary.

7
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:11,676
- Very good.

8
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:12,510
Give it a go.

9
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,344
- Thank you.

10
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,905
- Knock it off.

11
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:34,030
- Butt out!

12
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,709
Better get going.

13
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,545
Jiro...

14
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,172
No more bullying, okay?

15
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,359
You look quite the hero.

16
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,736
I slipped and fell.

17
00:06:03,415 --> 00:06:04,812
- Fighting is never justified.

18
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,229
- I know.

19
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,493
Go have your snack.

20
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,245
Thank you.

21
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,416
Big brother, you're back!

22
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:18,930
I was waiting for you.

23
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,868
Let's pick bamboo grass.

24
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,882
Big brother!

25
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,430
I want to pick bamboo grass.

26
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,604
You promised to go with me.

27
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,980
I've got homework.

28
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,196
That's not homework.

29
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,740
It's an English magazine.

30
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,745
What a stupid moustache.

31
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,789
He's a famous Italian aircraft designer.

32
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:58,345
His name is Caproni.

33
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:00,618
It says he's a count.

34
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:02,348
- Your face is scratched.

35
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:03,911
- Leave it alone.

36
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,759
I better put some iodine on it.

37
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,802
Would you be quiet?

38
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,982
Big brother, what are you doing?

39
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,817
You're not allowed up here.

40
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,486
You're not wearing glasses.

41
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,990
Focusing on the stars should improve my eyesight.

42
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,151
- Mother will scold you.

43
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:34,652
- A shooting star!

44
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,748
There's another one.

45
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,102
They're pretty.

46
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:41,214
See?

47
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:42,326
Like that.

48
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,839
There's so many of them.

49
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,045
I'm a Japanese boy.

50
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,345
I think this is my dream.

51
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,406
This is my dream, you know.

52
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,324
It's mine too.

53
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,909
Your dream?

54
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:58,319
Listen, Japanese boy.

55
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,571
You think we are sharing this dream?

56
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:01,915
It's strange.

57
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:04,241
You're Count Caproni, aren't you?

58
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:06,409
I'm very glad to meet you.

59
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:09,191
Interesting.

60
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:10,636
Yes, this is a dream.

61
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:12,081
This world is a dream.

62
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,094
Welcome to my kingdom.

63
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,763
I'm honored.

64
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,766
Look at them.

65
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:26,014
They will bomb the enemy city.

66
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:28,016
Most of them won't return.

67
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,284
But the war will soon be over.

68
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,128
Climb up, Japanese boy.

69
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:52,456
This is my dream.

70
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:54,833
When the war is over, I will build this.

71
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,764
Magnificent, isn't she?

72
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,808
Let's fly.

73
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,564
Instead of bombs, she'll carry passengers.

74
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,493
Of course we can't climb up here...

75
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:21,172
but dreams are convenient.

76
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:22,652
One can go anywhere.

77
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:32,058
Come, join me.

78
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:33,871
You can walk along the spar.

79
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,180
Take a look.

80
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:17,291
- She's beautiful, no?

81
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:19,209
- Yes, incredible.

82
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,477
She'll carry a hundred people across the Atlantic.

83
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,221
Mr.

84
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:30,972
Caproni?

85
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:31,723
I have a question.

86
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,236
Do you think I could design airplanes?

87
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,189
I'll never be a pilot.

88
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:41,732
I'm too nearsighted.

89
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,412
Listen, Japanese boy.

90
00:11:45,632 --> 00:11:47,259
I'm not a pilot.

91
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,906
I don't even know how to fly.

92
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,920
To fly airplanes is simple.

93
00:11:53,348 --> 00:11:55,496
But I am a creator of airplanes.

94
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:57,664
An aeronautical engineer!

95
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,217
Yes!

96
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,595
Listen to me, Japanese boy.

97
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:03,941
Airplanes are not tools for war.

98
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:06,088
They are not for making money.

99
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,769
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.

100
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,064
Engineers turn dreams into reality.

101
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,565
Yes!

102
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,265
Arrivederci.

103
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:16,682
We'll meet again.

104
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,961
Jiro, you should go to bed.

105
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:37,455
You startled me.

106
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:39,791
I heard you talking to someone.

107
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,303
Mother, I'm going to be an aeronautical engineer.

108
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:44,878
Really?

109
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,295
That's a wonderful dream.

110
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:48,403
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.

111
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:50,050
That's what he told me.

112
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,604
I want to design beautiful airplanes.

113
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:22,833
You, there.

114
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:23,958
Come, take my seat.

115
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,178
Pardon me.

116
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,430
Please.

117
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,718
The wind feels wonderful.

118
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,637
Miss, you'll lose your hat.

119
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,889
Don't worry, Kinu.

120
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,899
Watch out!

121
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,236
Are you all right?

122
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,030
Safe!

123
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,865
Nice play.

124
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,950
Thank you.

125
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,244
