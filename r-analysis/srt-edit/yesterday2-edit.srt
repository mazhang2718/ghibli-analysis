2
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:15,985
But you're off to Yamagata, right?

3
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:17,081
Yes.

4
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:19,425
Broke up with your boyfriend?

5
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:22,360
I just prefer the countryside.

6
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,074
- See ya!

7
00:02:23,094 --> 00:02:23,689
- Bye!

8
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:25,164
Let's go play!

9
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:26,833
Bye now!

10
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:28,674
Later!

11
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:31,149
Did you get good grades?

12
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:32,822
No.

13
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:34,336
But I don't care.

14
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:35,287
How come?

15
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:38,557
As soon as I get home, we're traveling to Grandma's.

16
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:40,963
So I won't get yelled at for ages.

17
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,642
Lucky you!

18
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,225
Are you going away too?

19
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,782
Yeah, to Nagano.

20
00:02:45,802 --> 00:02:47,234
How about you, Taeko?

21
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:48,244
I'm not sure.

22
00:02:48,548 --> 00:02:50,984
My Dad bought a summer place.

23
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:52,745
Wow... that's great!

24
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:57,628
Such a bad grade in math again.

25
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:01,234
But I got a "B" in science.

26
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:04,265
Are we going away for the holidays?

27
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:05,808
Not really.

28
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:08,547
Take me someplace.

29
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,371
I'll take you to a movie.

30
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,603
Find out what's playing.

31
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,228
Not that.

32
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:16,742
I mean to the country...

33
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,762
The country?

34
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,232
Like Grandma's country house.

35
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:21,826
Grandma lives with us.

36
00:03:21,947 --> 00:03:23,111
- Grandpa's then...

37
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:24,295
- He's dead.

38
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:28,507
We don't have relatives in the country, so don't ask.

39
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:36,561
My family had lived in Tokyo for generations.

40
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:39,725
I envied friends who had family in the countryside.

41
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,261
It's too late to book.

42
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:45,792
All hotels will be full.

43
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,112
But I really want to go...

44
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:50,547
What about "Onoya"?

45
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,760
We're regulars.

46
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,810
They'd have a room for us.

47
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:56,089
Where's that?

48
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:57,917
Good idea.

49
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,647
Taeko's never been there.

50
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:00,930
That's right.

51
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:03,804
Is it in the mountains... by the sea?

52
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:05,805
It's in Atami.

53
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,039
Atami?

54
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,780
You get to ride the bullet train.

55
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:12,881
Sure, you ll love it.

56
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,656
Atami...

57
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:20,532
Lots of different hot springs...

58
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:23,867
There's a huge Roman Bath.

59
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:29,784
And others, like the Swan Bath and the Violet Bath.

60
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:31,685
The beautiful Violet Bath!

61
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:34,021
The Violet Bath...

62
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:35,284
Oh yes.

63
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:36,417
It's fantastic.

64
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:38,364
You love hot springs, right?

65
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,838
Since father's working, you four go.

66
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:44,336
What?!

67
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:49,249
Us?

68
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:50,787
Go too?!

69
00:04:57,534 --> 00:05:01,371
I'm amazed you show up every morning.

70
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:04,172
Everyone else has left town.

71
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:08,781
Aren't you going anywhere?

72
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:09,777
- Yes, I am.

73
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:10,477
- Where?

74
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,648
Atami.

75
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:13,480
Atami?

76
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,045
What's in Atami?

77
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:16,963
Hot springs.

78
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:22,399
It's good timing.

79
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,506
We're going away next week.

80
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:30,178
No-one will be around for ages.

81
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:33,884
Hello.

82
00:05:33,904 --> 00:05:34,817
Okajima residence.

83
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:36,322
Nanako?

84
00:05:36,342 --> 00:05:37,722
It's Taeko.

85
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:40,075
I leave today.

86
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:42,323
Any message for your husband's family?

87
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:45,100
Not really.

88
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,332
Just buy them something.

89
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:50,288
Say it's from us and I'll pay you back.

90
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:52,101
Don't worry about it.

91
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:53,820
How's Mom?

92
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,455
She's out today.

93
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:59,937
She was mad you turned down that guy's proposal.

94
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:03,908
"At 27, that's the best offer she's going to get!"

95
00:06:04,014 --> 00:06:06,610
It's all she talks about.

96
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:08,644
She's got a point.

97
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:10,579
You're not young anymore...

98
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:11,887
Oh, yeah?

99
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:13,486
Definitely.

100
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:15,999
You've got to settle down eventually.

101
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:20,599
By the way, did you really work in the fields last year?

102
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,532
Yes, harvesting rice.

103
00:06:22,552 --> 00:06:24,365
This year, I'm picking safflower.

104
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:25,508
Safflower?

105
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:29,648
Thanks to you, I finally have family in the countryside.

106
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:33,230
So, I'm making the most of it!

107
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:36,331
Give me a break!

108
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:44,272
Rather than stay in that old house, why not treat yourself to a fancy hotel for once?

109
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,478
Maybe you'd meet a nice boy.

110
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:48,959
No way.

111
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:51,207
You mean a hotel like "Onoya"?

112
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:52,729
"Onoya"?

113
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:56,962
Not that again!

114
00:06:57,773 --> 00:07:00,242
You've got to get over it.

115
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:03,407
Let go of that baggage from the past!

116
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:17,798
My sisters, of course, would never go to a place like atami.

117
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:21,777
Grandma...

118
00:07:22,882 --> 00:07:24,681
Almost done?

119
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,453
Let's go to another bath.

120
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:29,959
We just went.

121
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:32,691
Only to the Swan Bath.

122
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:46,085
Bored to tears, I went alone to the Brothers Grimm Bath the Mermaid Bath, the Lemon Bath, and the Violet Bath, one after the other.

123
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:48,215
It's enormous!

124
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:52,254
When I got to the Roman Bath, my head was spinning.

125
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:55,963
It's amazing...

126
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,686
And I fainted.

127
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:11,259
And with that, my trip was over.

128
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:15,134
Followed by endless weeks of vacation.

129
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:34,863
The other day, my sisters and I were reminiscing.

130
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:43,213
We couldn't stop laughing as the memories came flooding back.

131
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:49,323
Had one before?

132
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:51,127
No, it's my first time.

133
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,263
I'm the one who asked for it.

134
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,599
Yeah, we know.

135
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:56,972
Where did you buy it?

136
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:58,443
Senbikiya in Ginza.

137
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:00,014
Must have been expensive.

138
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:03,213
How do we eat it?

139
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:04,549
Slice it into rings.

140
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:06,125
But how?

141
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:09,563
I don't know.

142
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,965
Didn't you ask in the store?

143
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:20,974
We'll eat it next Sunday.

144
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:23,486
Why not now?!

145
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:26,149
We don't know how.

146
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:30,831
I'll have a banana.

147
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:32,562
Me too.

148
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:40,380
Strange fruit they have in those hot countries.

149
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:44,690
I'm home!

150
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:47,028
I know how to eat the pineapple!

151
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,427
Really?

152
00:09:53,206 --> 00:09:54,606
I'll take that.

153
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:56,640
Mind your fingers.

154
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:59,045
Wouldn't a carving knife be best?

155
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:14,231
What a nice smell.

156
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:25,551
It smells so good.

157
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:29,432
I see.

158
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:31,238
Get plates.

159
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:31,984
Quick.

160
00:10:32,105 --> 00:10:34,371
Okay.

161
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:37,442
Let us eat.

162
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:00,949
It's hard.

163
00:11:05,262 --> 00:11:06,992
It's not very good.

164
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:08,657
Not so sweet.

165
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,829
Nothing like the canned stuff.

166
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:14,776
Live long enough and you see lots of different things.

167
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:21,245
- You can have mine.

168
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,412
- Mine too.

169
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:53,873
It's delicious...

170
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:01,654
Don't force yourself.

171
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,352
You'll get a stomachache.

172
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:15,579
What a let down.

173
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,451
Bananas taste much better.

174
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:21,786
You're so right.

175
00:12:21,893 --> 00:12:25,024
Bananas are still the king of fruits.

176
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:26,395
I ll have one now.

177
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,848
The king of fruit is...

178
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:59,219
the banana, after all.

179
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:09,202
The year I fainted at the baths and had my first pineapple...

180
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:16,984
the Beatles came to Japan, started the rock 'n'roll band and electric guitar craze.

181
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,296
My sister Nanako, a freshman in art school, was up on all the trends.

182
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:28,471
Yeah, the Beatles'lyrics are great.

183
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:36,281
When she wore a mini-skirt, she'd cover her bottom going up the stairs.

184
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:44,692
My clever sister, Yaeko, was crazy about some Takarazuka actress.

185
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,133
Yaeko...

186
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:49,168
I told you to knock!

187
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:58,856
My sisters' memories are mainly of fashion and pop trends.

188
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:04,223
For them, 1966 is the height of nostalgia.

189
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:08,166
Whereas I was only ten years old.

190
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:12,945
My favorite band had yet to debut....

191
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:17,682
My only memories are the back and forth between school and home.

192
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,760
...mine was pinned on the wall!

193
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:22,023
That's nice.

194
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:26,504
And it might be entered in an essay contest.

195
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:29,202
So, teacher kept it.

196
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:31,370
- I'd be so happy...

197
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,072
- You didn't finish lunch again.

198
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:36,252
Why do you hide the pickles inside the bread?

199
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:38,257
'Cause I hate them.

200
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:40,148
I've got to throw it away.

201
00:14:40,168 --> 00:14:41,947
What a waste.

202
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,533
Such a picky eater!

203
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:51,541
I'd rather you were a good eater than a good essay writer.

204
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,279
How can you drink that stuff?

205
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:14,794
Milk's okay.

206
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,746
It's onions I hate.

207
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:20,524
I'm leaving carrots so I've got no choice.

208
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,965
Who decided we can only leave one thing?

209
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:27,201
Shall I drink it?

210
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,539
Would you?

211
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,873
You'll eat my onions next time?

212
00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:45,478
- Carrots?

213
00:15:45,498 --> 00:15:46,627
- We're allowed one thing!

214
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:57,891
Two bowls is gross.

215
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,323
People who run in the corridor...

216
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:06,536
...when the hall monitor says stop, should be punished.

217
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:10,073
How are you gonna do that?

218
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:12,050
They shouldn't do it.

219
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,345
That's right.

220
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:15,423
You might bump into someone.

221
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:19,862
If I bumped into you I'd bounce a mile!

222
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:21,093
Get lost!

223
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:25,669
Running is no big deal.

224
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,869
I agree!

225
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:28,770
- Let's change the rule.

226
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,472
- But we already decided.

227
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:33,212
Raise your hand if you want to speak.

228
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:34,759
- Here!

229
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:35,772
- Miss Tani.

230
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:43,963
The hall monitor should chase the offender, catch them and punish them.

231
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:46,133
Mr.

232
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:46,833
Suzuki.

233
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:51,748
Then the hall monitor should be punished for running too.

234
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:52,561
He's right!

235
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:53,278
He's right!

236
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:55,248
Way to go!

237
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,428
He's right.

238
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,520
Miss Tani.

239
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:03,900
The hall monitor shouldn't be punished because...

240
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:09,543
...it's like a policeman chasing a speeding car.

241
00:17:15,862 --> 00:17:18,024
Any objections?

242
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:21,664
It makes sense...

243
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:23,502
No more running.

244
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:29,416
So, the hall monitor can chase offenders.

245
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:33,023
Any other issues?

246
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,660
Miss Tani.

247
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,082
- Her again.

248
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:37,844
- Busybody.

249
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,298
Be quiet.

250
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:41,803
Some people don't finish lunch.

251
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:47,008
I just read an article on the Vietnam War.

252
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:50,981
There are many unfortunate people overseas.

253
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:52,648
We're very lucky.

254
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:54,659
Lucky to have you near me!

255
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:01,305
We should be grateful for our food.

256
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:08,149
We're allowed to leave one thing on our plates, but I think it's wrong!

257
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,522
Goody two-shoes.

258
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:16,183
- It can't hurt to leave one thing.

259
00:18:16,203 --> 00:18:18,415
- Let's all leave milk...

260
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:20,108
- Give it to someone else...

261
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:21,691
- Of course.

262
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:23,847
- People hide leftovers in bread.

263
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:25,896
- That's cheating!

264
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:28,050
I hate school food.

265
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:30,855
If you want to speak, raise your hand!

266
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:34,117
What a revolting situation.

267
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:49,309
That night in bed, after chatting to my sisters more memories from fifth grade came rushing back.

268
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:54,682
Our pet dog... .

269
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:57,015
School sports day...

270
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:00,465
being scared by gross horror comics....

271
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:04,507
longing for an electric pencil-sharpener...

272
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:10,347
So many little details, one after the other...

273
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:17,925
playing in my head like a movie, almost overpowering me.

274
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:24,704
Is there a Miss Okajima here?

275
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:27,374
That's her.

276
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,673
Hirota in our class says he likes you.

277
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:48,681
Let's go.

278
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:54,563
We'll say we told you.

279
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,968
Told you.

280
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:05,481
Where is it?

281
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:06,610
Over there.

282
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,287
Shuji Hirota and Taeko Oka jima lt's true!

283
00:20:13,064 --> 00:20:14,897
What's he like?

284
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:15,805
- No idea.

285
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:16,619
- Me, neither.

286
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:19,230
Taeko, you sure you don't know him?

287
00:20:19,342 --> 00:20:22,040
No... of course not... not at all.

288
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:29,224
Which one is Hirota?

289
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:30,585
It's the girls from Room 5.

290
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:32,788
Hirota, they're looking for you.

291
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,159
I'm here!

292
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:40,901
Don't write silly things on the wall.

293
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:43,445
Taeko told us to tell you.

294
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:45,609
I didn't write anything.

295
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,419
You said you liked Okajima in Room 5.

296
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:50,789
You did.

297
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:52,420
So, we wrote it for you.

298
00:20:54,235 --> 00:20:57,673
I love you so much....

299
00:20:57,774 --> 00:21:01,577
But you're so far away....

300
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:04,049
Like gazing up at...

301
00:21:04,152 --> 00:21:05,380
Goodbye.

302
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:08,720
A far distant star.

303
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:13,528
Taeko!

304
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:17,536
We just went to see Hirota.

305
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:23,574
We told him not to write things on walls.

306
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:26,049
Tsuneko!

307
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:27,646
Ah, no running.

308
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,328
Aren't you glad?

309
00:21:41,281 --> 00:21:53,234
5th Grade: Room 4 Over here.

310
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,059
See?

311
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,459
That's him.

312
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:04,527
What?

313
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:06,713
Hirota likes Taeko?

314
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:08,715
He's amazing.

315
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:10,115
A real star.

316
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,063
You mean baseball?

317
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:14,501
Only Tono can hit his pitches.

318
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:16,938
Really?

319
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,004
Our team plays his in the next game.

320
00:22:27,627 --> 00:22:30,792
Go, go, Hirota!

321
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,372
Go for it, Tono!

322
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,405
Hit it, Tono!

323
00:22:37,845 --> 00:22:39,336
Kill it!

324
00:22:41,217 --> 00:22:43,653
Go for it, Hirota!

325
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,620
Taeko's watching you!

326
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,669
Hit it, Tono!

327
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,832
Way to go, Hirota!

328
00:23:11,135 --> 00:23:12,899
Strike him out!

329
00:23:13,505 --> 00:23:16,271
Don't you dare cheer their side!

330
00:23:16,377 --> 00:23:18,438
Of course not!

331
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:22,384
Go, go, Tono!

332
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,411
Hiro, Hiro, Hirota!

333
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,482
Hit it!

334
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:43,814
One leg stance!

335
00:23:58,115 --> 00:23:59,378
Wow!

336
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:04,615
Way to go, Hirota!

337
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:11,469
I knew nothing about baseball.

338
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:14,303
But even I could tell he was superb.

339
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:25,327
Go, go, Hirota!

340
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:29,596
What's up, Taeko?

341
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:35,906
Between the cold and the excitement, I ran to the bathroom five times.

342
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,671
Over here, over here!

343
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:44,285
Game!

344
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:50,094
Room 4 wins.

345
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:52,869
Thank you for the game.

346
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:55,976
You were great Hirota!

347
00:24:56,081 --> 00:24:57,208
Good job.

348
00:24:57,316 --> 00:24:59,217
You were amazing!

349
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,521
It was all your fault.

350
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:02,682
How come?

351
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,226
You don't know anything.

352
00:25:04,762 --> 00:25:07,996
If Tono couldn't hit him, how could we?

353
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:09,228
That's right.

354
00:25:09,704 --> 00:25:14,041
You missed the throw and three runs scored.

355
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,943
That's not true.

356
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,080
Coach said he'd buy us ice cream.

357
00:25:19,196 --> 00:25:20,042
- Really?

358
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:20,908
- Great!

359
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:24,485
Hirota, you should go see her.

360
00:25:24,596 --> 00:25:26,258
Yeah, you should.

361
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:30,829
I'm going home.

362
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:34,072
What's the matter, Taeko?

363
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:39,853
Look, she left.

364
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:29,702
Um...

365
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:40,215
...that stuff...

366
00:26:40,993 --> 00:26:44,762
...on the wall...

367
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,503
Rainy day or...

368
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:53,772
cloudy or sunny day...

369
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:55,812
which do you like?

370
00:27:10,643 --> 00:27:11,406
Cloudy.

371
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:13,748
Me too!

372
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:58,686
Rainy day or cloudy or sunny day.

373
00:28:59,162 --> 00:29:01,189
Which do you like?

374
00:29:03,402 --> 00:29:05,031
Me, too.

375
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:29,914
I didn't intend the ten year-old me to come on this trip.

376
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:37,591
But somehow, once she showed up she wouldn't leave me alone.

377
00:30:07,412 --> 00:30:11,043
But why me in the 5th grade?

378
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:18,521
Second hour, all boys play baseball, all girls to the gym.

379
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:19,428
How come?

380
00:30:19,532 --> 00:30:21,023
Baseball, great!

381
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:36,724
Today I'm going to talk about something very important.

382
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:46,473
You'll leave grade school, then junior school then high school.

383
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:50,017
Then become grown ups and have babies.

384
00:30:50,118 --> 00:30:54,114
A woman's body prepares to have babies.

385
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:04,035
Did you know?

386
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:06,136
Really?

387
00:31:06,847 --> 00:31:12,022
Mom told me when I was in fourth grade, since I'm an early-developer.

388
00:31:12,123 --> 00:31:13,021
Early-developer?

389
00:31:13,124 --> 00:31:14,353
That's right.

390
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:19,260
She said tall girls or big girls get their periods early.

391
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:24,774
I bet those other girls already have theirs.

392
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:31,826
- Are you gonna buy them?

393
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:32,674
- I am.

394
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,020
I knew it.

395
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:36,286
You'll buy them, too, right?

396
00:31:36,498 --> 00:31:38,934
Well... yeah.

397
00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:41,369
I think you should.

398
00:31:41,573 --> 00:31:46,309
Nurse said we all need them eventually.

399
00:31:46,415 --> 00:31:47,781
That's true.

400
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:04,270
The girls are buying underpants in the infirmary.

401
00:32:07,617 --> 00:32:09,917
Did you know?

402
00:32:10,022 --> 00:32:11,011
No.

403
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:13,093
But why?

404
00:32:14,262 --> 00:32:16,424
How come you're buying underpants?

405
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:18,865
It's because...

406
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,063
Umm...

407
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,271
Why is the school selling underpants?

408
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,935
Are they for swimming?

409
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:29,378
You told Nakayama?

410
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:31,419
Why did you do that!?

411
00:32:31,525 --> 00:32:33,323
You shouldn't tell boys.

412
00:32:33,428 --> 00:32:36,160
It's supposed to be our secret.

413
00:32:40,774 --> 00:32:44,177
It's because she likes him...

414
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,010
Did he ask you?

415
00:32:51,893 --> 00:32:52,861
What's going on?

416
00:32:52,961 --> 00:32:56,263
She told Nakayama about periods.

417
00:32:56,568 --> 00:32:58,196
No!

418
00:32:58,704 --> 00:33:01,402
He'll tell everyone.

419
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:02,875
I said to keep it secret.

420
00:33:02,978 --> 00:33:05,608
You trust him?

421
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:10,677
- Oh no...

422
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,441
- Boys are disgusting.

423
00:33:12,662 --> 00:33:14,894
Now they'll be looking up our skirts.

424
00:33:19,006 --> 00:33:20,098
Pervert!

425
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:25,917
Looking up skirts was all the rage and periods became an obsession.

426
00:33:26,018 --> 00:33:28,487
You got your period!

427
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,856
Cut it out!

428
00:33:32,862 --> 00:33:34,889
Second period break.

429
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,865
Idiot.

430
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:37,061
Ouch.

431
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:38,138
Come here!

432
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,941
You've got a period.

433
00:33:42,045 --> 00:33:43,673
No, I don't!

434
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,949
It's all Rie's fault.

435
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,457
I'm sorry.

436
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:54,726
What for?

437
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:57,270
For telling Nakayama.

438
00:33:57,372 --> 00:33:58,840
It doesn't matter.

439
00:33:59,308 --> 00:34:03,179
The nurse said it's very important.

440
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:05,414
I know.

441
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,549
I started when I was in fourth grade.

442
00:34:08,658 --> 00:34:09,887
Really?

443
00:34:11,272 --> 00:34:12,330
That's why I skip P.

444
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,408
E.

445
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:14,486
Sometimes.

446
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:15,580
You skip P.

447
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,369
E.

448
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,158
With a period?

449
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:20,334
Mom said I should.

450
00:34:21,613 --> 00:34:26,144
He even said he felt sorry for us.

451
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:27,693
You told him about skipping P.

452
00:34:27,713 --> 00:34:28,774
E.?

453
00:34:30,294 --> 00:34:33,858
He promised not to tell the others.

454
00:34:33,977 --> 00:34:35,570
So, then they'll think all girls who skip P.

455
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,183
E.

456
00:34:37,203 --> 00:34:38,796
Have periods!

457
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:40,236
You think so?

458
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:41,370
Of course!

459
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:46,465
Please excuse Taeko from P.

460
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:47,687
E.

461
00:34:47,707 --> 00:34:48,909
Because of her cold.

462
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:55,339
I'm not missing P.

463
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,119
E.

464
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,041
Your cold will get worse.

465
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:01,876
Then I'll stay home.

466
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:02,988
No.

467
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:03,904
You don't have a fever.

468
00:35:04,095 --> 00:35:04,821
Then I'll do P.

469
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:05,567
E.

470
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:07,247
Fine, go ahead.

471
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:10,190
Don't blame me if it gets worse.

472
00:35:14,102 --> 00:35:15,661
See you later.

473
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,478
Since when was she so fond of P.

474
00:35:18,498 --> 00:35:20,026
E.?

475
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,492
You're bright red.

476
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:30,028
She's right.

477
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,530
Are you okay?

478
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:32,594
I have a cold.

479
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:34,366
You have a fever.

480
00:35:34,481 --> 00:35:35,076
You should skip P.

481
00:35:35,096 --> 00:35:35,691
E.

482
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:37,332
Yeah, you should.

483
00:35:37,443 --> 00:35:39,071
I'll go tell the teacher.

484
00:35:39,312 --> 00:35:40,405
No, don't.

485
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:41,743
Why not?

486
00:35:42,317 --> 00:35:44,378
Mom already wrote a note.

487
00:35:44,788 --> 00:35:47,554
There's no problem then.

488
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,790
Out of the way!

489
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:53,726
Ouch!

490
00:35:58,856 --> 00:35:59,701
I'm missing P.

491
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:00,566
E.

492
00:36:00,586 --> 00:36:01,431
Too.

493
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:02,296
Just like you.

494
00:36:09,664 --> 00:36:11,326
Lucky them.

495
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:14,637
I wish I could play, too.

496
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,811
Do you...

497
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:24,654
...are you having a period?

498
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:26,116
Yes.

499
00:36:27,906 --> 00:36:29,086
I'm not.

500
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:30,286
I have a cold.

501
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:31,755
I know.

502
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:33,121
You're sick.

503
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:34,593
Just sick.

504
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:35,959
That's all.

505
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,106
A period isn't a sickness.

506
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:48,261
I could still play...

507
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,270
I'm gonna catch a period!

508
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:55,803
Don't touch it, don't touch it!

509
00:36:56,321 --> 00:36:57,667
That was close.

510
00:36:57,687 --> 00:36:59,033
Almost caught it...

511
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,686
Over here, over here!

512
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:08,387
"Catch a period"!

513
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,732
What a silly thing to say.

514
00:37:15,476 --> 00:37:17,275
It's no laughing matter!

515
00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:22,253
Taeko?

516
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,269
It's the period pair!

517
00:37:31,404 --> 00:37:32,736
No, we're not!

518
00:37:33,407 --> 00:37:34,875
Stupid boys.

519
00:37:43,491 --> 00:37:45,723
You're so calm about it.

520
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:50,996
Mom said it's nothing to be ashamed of.

521
00:37:51,638 --> 00:37:53,607
I guess so, but...

522
00:37:58,383 --> 00:38:02,379
Like it or not, a butterfly must first...

523
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,527
live as a caterpillar before it can fly away.

524
00:38:18,684 --> 00:38:25,388
Maybe I remember those days because I was going through the caterpillar stage.

525
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:33,609
Something definitely changed when I started working.

526
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:41,182
at work and at play we girls were livelier and more spirited than guys.

527
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:45,026
It was like we'd finally found our wings.

528
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:53,340
But looking back now, maybe we were just flexing them pointlessly.

529
00:38:58,418 --> 00:39:07,563
Perhaps the fifth grade me was tagging along with a message for me to reflect and rethink my life.

530
00:39:13,678 --> 00:39:19,086
Anyway, I decided to sleep the rest of the way.

531
00:40:05,934 --> 00:40:07,334
Ouch!

532
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,388
Excuse me, has the Tokyo train gone?

533
00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:21,488
Was that your train?

534
00:40:21,594 --> 00:40:22,653
No...

535
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:32,440
Taeko Okajima, right?

536
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:34,739
Yes, that's correct...

537
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,648
Thank goodness.

538
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,286
The car's this way.

539
00:40:38,623 --> 00:40:41,253
Excuse me, but who are you?

540
00:40:41,628 --> 00:40:43,393
You don't remember?

541
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:46,263
Of course you don't.

542
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:49,711
I'm Toshio.

543
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:51,493
Kazuo s second cousin.

544
00:40:55,051 --> 00:40:57,043
Oh, I see...

545
00:41:04,634 --> 00:41:06,296
What's so funny?

546
00:41:06,948 --> 00:41:08,163
Nothing.

547
00:41:08,183 --> 00:41:09,398
Sorry.

548
00:41:09,743 --> 00:41:13,512
I thought you were trying to steal my bag.

549
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:17,912
That's terrible.

550
00:41:17,932 --> 00:41:20,314
Didn't I ask your name?

551
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:22,683
Yes, you did.

552
00:41:22,703 --> 00:41:24,915
I just thought... sorry...

553
00:41:26,738 --> 00:41:28,765
I beg your pardon.

554
00:41:28,876 --> 00:41:30,208
No problem.

555
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:34,847
Where's Kazuo?

556
00:41:35,153 --> 00:41:41,927
He asked me last night to come pick you up It's been raining?

557
00:41:42,031 --> 00:41:44,763
Yeah, but it'll clear today.

558
00:41:46,105 --> 00:41:53,276
I should've used my Dad's car but I like mine better.

559
00:41:56,857 --> 00:41:58,723
It's a little tight.

560
00:42:14,286 --> 00:42:15,879
May I leave it on?

561
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:17,480
Sure.

562
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:49,469
This is unusual music.

563
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,478
It's a Hungarian group.

564
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,954
Hungarian?

565
00:42:56,892 --> 00:42:58,623
You know a lot about it?

566
00:42:58,906 --> 00:42:59,967
A little.

567
00:42:59,987 --> 00:43:01,048
It's farmer's music.

568
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:02,863
I like it because I'm a farmer.

569
00:43:03,837 --> 00:43:05,135
Cool.

570
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,032
Right?

571
00:43:30,283 --> 00:43:34,450
Remember last year's party at the farmhouse?

572
00:43:36,694 --> 00:43:40,257
A bunch of guys turned up, right?

573
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:42,326
Maybe you don't remember.

574
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:48,613
They came to check out the girl from Tokyo.

575
00:43:48,714 --> 00:43:50,684
I was one of them.

576
00:43:53,055 --> 00:43:54,250
Watch out, jerk!

577
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,032
I heard you're picking safflower.

578
00:44:08,052 --> 00:44:10,764
Do you dye fabric?

579
00:44:10,886 --> 00:44:13,413
Just curious.

580
00:44:13,534 --> 00:44:16,246
Safflower's kind of unusual.

581
00:44:16,266 --> 00:44:18,978
Well, maybe not for you.

582
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:27,176
It's known as a famous local product but hardly anyone grows it.

583
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:29,721
- Wasn't it big in the old days?

584
00:44:29,741 --> 00:44:32,004
- For the merchants, sure.

585
00:44:32,556 --> 00:44:37,053
They got rich, but for farmers, it was just another crop.

586
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:45,173
Do you know: In time whose skin will it grace, this crimson flower.

587
00:44:45,287 --> 00:44:47,299
The famous Basho poem?

588
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:49,331
I read it before coming.

589
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:51,017
Is that so?

590
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:54,284
I only learned it last night.

591
00:44:57,432 --> 00:45:06,108
I also read that the flower-pickers couldn't afford to wear the rouge they made.

592
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,596
Is that where you had the barbeque?

593
00:45:17,866 --> 00:45:20,894
There'll be another this year, too.

594
00:45:32,325 --> 00:45:36,424
Are market reforms making agriculture difficult?

595
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:38,398
Absolutely.

596
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:44,074
As things go, Japanese farming might just collapse, all of sudden, one day.

597
00:45:45,113 --> 00:45:51,922
But then again, anything worth struggling for will be hard work.

598
00:45:52,025 --> 00:45:54,517
Isn't it the same in the city?

599
00:45:54,864 --> 00:45:55,922
Yes.

600
00:45:56,399 --> 00:46:00,201
But fewer people live for their work.

601
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,066
What about you?

602
00:46:04,045 --> 00:46:05,206
Me?

603
00:46:07,284 --> 00:46:12,487
I don't live for my job but I don't hate it either.

604
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:17,630
I could farm twenty-four hours a day.

605
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:21,165
It's fascinating to raise living things.

606
00:46:22,243 --> 00:46:24,235
You have livestock?

607
00:46:27,596 --> 00:46:30,536
Not that.

608
00:46:30,556 --> 00:46:33,496
We've got some animals, but I'm talking about rice, apples, cherries.

609
00:46:33,516 --> 00:46:36,456
They're all living things.

610
00:46:37,436 --> 00:46:44,706
If we take good care of them, I feel like they'll do their best for us.

611
00:46:48,355 --> 00:46:50,551
Listen to me preach.

612
00:46:50,969 --> 00:46:52,634
Not at all.

613
00:46:52,654 --> 00:46:54,319
I get what you mean.

614
00:46:54,432 --> 00:46:58,029
To tell the truth, I used to work in an office.

615
00:46:58,137 --> 00:47:01,667
I only just started farming.

616
00:47:01,911 --> 00:47:04,814
Is that right?

617
00:47:05,494 --> 00:47:07,944
That's why I'm so enthusiastic.

618
00:47:07,964 --> 00:47:10,414
It's very important.

619
00:47:11,928 --> 00:47:15,560
I quit work and joined my friend's organic farm.

620
00:47:15,668 --> 00:47:19,197
People said I'm nuts, but I don't regret it.

621
00:47:19,608 --> 00:47:21,770
Organic farm?

622
00:47:23,615 --> 00:47:27,884
"Grown with no artificial chemicals whatsoever."

623
00:47:28,623 --> 00:47:32,221
Just blood, sweat and tears!

624
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:36,997
We use all natural stuff, no pesticides or anything.

625
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:44,851
I've seen the labels: "No chemicals used" But it's not just that.

626
00:47:44,951 --> 00:47:48,389
We bring out the plant's life force.

627
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:53,226
It's cool... like lending nature a hand.

628
00:47:55,569 --> 00:47:58,939
Sounds easy, but it's damn hard work.

629
00:48:06,555 --> 00:48:09,355
I was told to take you straight to the fields.

630
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,452
Yes, I'm starting right away.

631
00:48:11,563 --> 00:48:14,090
Not going to rest?

632
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:19,142
Don't you pick the flowers early while the thorns are still soft?

633
00:48:19,243 --> 00:48:20,734
That's right, but...

634
00:48:20,846 --> 00:48:24,215
I'm trying to become an early-riser.

635
00:48:24,786 --> 00:48:27,382
That's why I took the night train.

636
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:30,223
You're certainly eager.

637
00:48:58,075 --> 00:48:59,373
There it is!

638
00:49:57,444 --> 00:49:59,675
'Morning, everyone!

639
00:50:09,031 --> 00:50:11,227
Great to have you back, Taeko.

640
00:50:11,334 --> 00:50:13,167
Thanks for having me.

641
00:50:14,907 --> 00:50:18,710
Grandma, you re looking well.

642
00:50:18,948 --> 00:50:21,247
Welcome back dear.

643
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,444
Aren't you tired?

644
00:50:22,955 --> 00:50:24,947
No, not at all.

645
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:28,158
We made your bed just in case.

646
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,885
That's okay.

647
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:31,450
Look, I'm raring to go!

648
00:50:31,569 --> 00:50:35,736
Wearing work pants too!

649
00:50:37,179 --> 00:50:39,614
That's all I brought.

650
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:44,880
Young people here don't wear them any more.

651
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,393
You look like the real thing Taeko.

652
00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:50,624
That's right.

653
00:51:13,775 --> 00:51:14,936
Taeko!

654
00:51:17,047 --> 00:51:18,037
Don't!

655
00:51:23,658 --> 00:51:27,620
And so began my second taste of country life.

656
00:51:36,947 --> 00:51:42,412
How could this yellow flower produce such a bright red?

657
00:51:43,091 --> 00:51:46,530
They told me a sad tale from the old days.

658
00:51:47,264 --> 00:51:55,776
The girls didn't have gloves, and their bare hands would get pricked by the thorns.

659
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,219
It was their blood that made the red so deep.

660
00:52:01,355 --> 00:52:10,226
I could imagine the resentment they must've felt toward the fancy city girls.

661
00:52:12,074 --> 00:52:16,480
To make a handful of rouge took nearly 500 lbs of petals.

662
00:52:16,581 --> 00:52:22,718
This rouge was literally worth its weight in gold.

663
00:53:49,573 --> 00:53:54,605
The petals are washed, trodden, then exposed to the air and the sun.

664
00:53:54,716 --> 00:53:58,815
As the petals oxidize, they gradually turn red.

665
00:54:02,128 --> 00:54:08,298
After a few more days, fermentation turns them bright red and they become sticky.

666
00:54:11,411 --> 00:54:20,818
Pounded, wrung into balls and sun-dried, they finally become the basic ingredient of rouge.

667
00:54:25,902 --> 00:54:29,340
The liquid from the pressing wasn't wasted either.

668
00:54:29,576 --> 00:54:36,119
The red pigment in the yellow broth was used to dye fabric.

669
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,711
Let's go dye our cloth.

670
00:54:38,557 --> 00:54:41,119
Safflower do your best.

671
00:54:41,229 --> 00:54:43,825
Cheer me up with your pretty color.

672
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:52,746
For those village girls, with no chance of make-up or kimonos, Safflower dye brought color into their drab lives.

673
00:54:56,755 --> 00:55:02,061
The yellow pigment dissolves in water leaving clothes a light pink.

674
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:04,157
So pretty!

675
00:55:06,372 --> 00:55:15,680
Machines now take away some of the work, but the petal's still need picking every day.

676
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:47,433
Rouge cakes soon mould, and the flowers wait for no one.

677
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:53,848
No sooner are you done picking, than they bloom again.

678
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:02,323
When the rains come, work continues into the early hours.

679
00:56:04,738 --> 00:56:12,985
Each day flew by, Pleasantly tired, I thought about the flower-pickers of old.

680
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:23,869
If I could've worked like this as a child, my school essays would've been really interesting.

681
00:56:39,998 --> 00:56:41,660
Mom, I need 5,000 yen.

682
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:43,038
5,000 yen?

683
00:56:43,058 --> 00:56:44,319
I can't give you that.

684
00:56:44,439 --> 00:56:48,003
You said you'd buy me new sneakers.

685
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:50,343
Are they that much?

686
00:56:51,351 --> 00:56:52,250
Nonsense.

687
00:56:52,353 --> 00:56:53,514
They're Pumas.

688
00:56:54,132 --> 00:56:55,313
- Pumas?

689
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:56,514
- It's a brand.

690
00:56:58,606 --> 00:57:00,988
I'm not sure.

691
00:57:01,008 --> 00:57:03,390
There must be cheaper ones.

692
00:57:03,505 --> 00:57:05,531
How about the ones you've got?

693
00:57:05,642 --> 00:57:08,078
Nobody wears them now.

694
00:57:08,313 --> 00:57:11,341
Everyone's getting Pumas.

695
00:57:11,451 --> 00:57:12,646
Who's everyone?

696
00:57:12,754 --> 00:57:16,818
Kako, Megu, Yachan, Nonchan.

697
00:57:16,927 --> 00:57:18,988
That's only four people.

698
00:57:19,265 --> 00:57:22,532
Everyone's wearing them!

699
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,392
No.

700
00:57:24,412 --> 00:57:26,157
You never do your chores.

701
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:30,717
Did you ask for a dress for your Barbie Doll?

702
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:35,789
Didn't you promise to ask only at Christmas and your birthday?

703
00:57:36,194 --> 00:57:38,527
You always spoil her.

704
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,462
Is that right, Taeko?

705
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:45,531
All of a sudden, the ten year-old me was back.

706
00:57:45,811 --> 00:57:47,677
But...

707
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:52,678
Yaeko got a kimono and it wasn't even her graduation.

708
00:57:53,023 --> 00:57:54,389
It's for tea-ceremony.

709
00:57:54,492 --> 00:58:00,758
You keep asking for lots of little stuff, we get one or two big things.

710
00:58:00,902 --> 00:58:01,665
Right?

711
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:03,000
Yep.

712
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,276
Stop that.

713
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:11,252
Always picky about food.

714
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,526
Dad loves the onions, right?

715
00:58:17,498 --> 00:58:22,063
Anyway, that kimono will be yours in the end.

716
00:58:22,507 --> 00:58:24,305
Always hand-me-downs.

717
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:26,232
- Some people don't get anything.

718
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,065
- Exactly.

719
00:58:28,183 --> 00:58:31,211
Then give me that enamel purse.

720
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:32,846
Didn't you give it to her yet?

721
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:35,065
You're too old for that.

722
00:58:35,085 --> 00:58:37,183
Give it to her.

723
00:58:45,078 --> 00:58:46,307
I don't want it.

724
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,611
Keep the stupid purse.

725
00:58:52,057 --> 00:58:54,458
Then I won't give it to you.

726
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:56,855
I'm not buying you a new one.

727
00:58:56,965 --> 00:58:57,796
Fine.

728
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,506
Good.

729
00:59:00,526 --> 00:59:02,288
I actually really like it.

730
00:59:02,675 --> 00:59:04,303
I hate it.

731
00:59:08,428 --> 00:59:09,991
Ready for dinner.

732
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:11,574
Take this away.

733
00:59:11,691 --> 00:59:14,126
See, has to be thrown away.

734
00:59:14,228 --> 00:59:16,198
What a waste.

735
00:59:17,611 --> 00:59:18,774
Don't throw it away!

736
00:59:18,794 --> 00:59:19,957
Please Mother.

737
00:59:20,071 --> 00:59:21,334
It's your fault.

738
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:24,440
Finish it yourself next time.

739
00:59:26,148 --> 00:59:28,675
You three are so selfish.

740
00:59:40,573 --> 00:59:44,740
Father, buy me an enamel purse.

741
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:49,415
Yaeko won't give me hers.

742
00:59:49,554 --> 00:59:51,387
You said you didn't want it.

743
00:59:53,461 --> 00:59:55,157
Yeah, but...

744
00:59:55,264 --> 00:59:57,928
You said it, you have to do it.

745
01:00:05,683 --> 01:00:07,845
Hurry up and get ready.

746
01:00:10,757 --> 01:00:13,125
I'll wear these!

747
01:00:14,864 --> 01:00:18,598
Why is Yaeko coming?

748
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:24,537
You said it was just the three of us.

749
01:00:25,393 --> 01:00:27,559
Because I finished my homework.

750
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:29,745
Is that a problem?

751
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:31,845
It's Chinese food.

752
01:00:31,865 --> 01:00:33,376
The more the merrier.

753
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:36,296
Grandma's not coming.

754
01:00:36,402 --> 01:00:39,100
She doesn't eat oily food.

755
01:00:39,407 --> 01:00:41,842
If you don't want to come, stay here.

756
01:01:06,987 --> 01:01:09,355
We're going Taeko.

757
01:01:10,727 --> 01:01:12,195
Come on slowpoke.

758
01:01:15,134 --> 01:01:17,468
I don't have a purse.

759
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:22,611
Lend her that enamel one.

760
01:01:47,523 --> 01:01:48,354
Here.

761
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:51,222
Ouch.

762
01:01:51,864 --> 01:01:53,264
Let's go.

763
01:01:53,633 --> 01:01:54,965
I'm not going.

764
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:56,442
Okay.

765
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:57,825
Let's go Mother.

766
01:01:58,275 --> 01:02:00,676
Stay with Grandma then.

767
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:09,183
Not coming Taeko?

768
01:02:09,661 --> 01:02:10,856
No I'm not.

769
01:02:28,993 --> 01:02:30,291
We're off then.

770
01:02:40,012 --> 01:02:41,605
I'm coming too!

771
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:55,937
No shoes!

772
01:03:00,748 --> 01:03:02,740
Father please.

773
01:03:27,794 --> 01:03:29,660
A button came off.

774
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:44,612
We didn't go out, of course.

775
01:03:44,723 --> 01:03:49,629
My face was swollen and a cold towel didn't stop the stinging.

776
01:03:50,066 --> 01:03:55,772
That night I couldn't sleep wondering why it was always me.

777
01:03:55,875 --> 01:04:01,343
Figuring I must've been adopted I cried myself to sleep.

778
01:04:02,086 --> 01:04:05,320
Was it the first time he hit you?

779
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:08,954
Yes, the first and only time.

780
01:04:10,668 --> 01:04:15,301
Dad slaps me often... well, sometimes.

781
01:04:15,409 --> 01:04:18,437
Maybe that's easier.

782
01:04:18,547 --> 01:04:22,316
When it's only once, you can't stop thinking why.

783
01:04:23,088 --> 01:04:27,654
It's hard to imagine you a selfish brat.

784
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,690
A spoiled brat.

785
01:04:30,802 --> 01:04:33,739
I wasn't just fussy about onions, either.

786
01:04:35,476 --> 01:04:38,709
Now I don't feel like I'm that bad.

787
01:04:38,815 --> 01:04:40,717
Wait a second!

788
01:04:40,829 --> 01:04:43,211
Your poor Mom.

789
01:04:43,231 --> 01:04:45,613
I shouldn't encourage you.

790
01:04:51,938 --> 01:04:54,534
I'm giving up on the Pumas.

791
01:04:54,643 --> 01:04:55,941
Good girl.

792
01:04:56,279 --> 01:05:00,343
Maybe I'll slip you some pocket money.

793
01:05:00,453 --> 01:05:01,751
Hooray!

794
01:05:24,093 --> 01:05:25,287
Hey!

795
01:05:27,432 --> 01:05:28,957
100 yen each.

796
01:05:35,446 --> 01:05:36,242
Taeko...

797
01:05:36,347 --> 01:05:37,576
Tomorrow...

798
01:05:37,849 --> 01:05:41,288
Let's go for a drive to Zao.

799
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:42,444
- Zao?

800
01:05:42,464 --> 01:05:43,309
- Yes.

801
01:05:44,227 --> 01:05:46,389
You went to Yamadera last year, right?

802
01:05:46,565 --> 01:05:48,591
The family said it was okay.

803
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,676
The views at Zao were beautiful.

804
01:06:18,018 --> 01:06:22,355
But Zao had become famous and touristy.

805
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,634
How come you re not married?

806
01:06:29,738 --> 01:06:33,905
Do you find that strange?

807
01:06:34,112 --> 01:06:36,582
Well, no, not really.

808
01:06:36,917 --> 01:06:39,683
Lots of women work now.

809
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:43,283
Most of my friends are single.

810
01:06:43,495 --> 01:06:45,259
Oh, is that right?

811
01:06:45,365 --> 01:06:46,731
That's right.

812
01:06:47,001 --> 01:06:48,333
I see.

813
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:49,829
It's true.

814
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:51,766
Right.

815
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,064
Really.

816
01:06:53,084 --> 01:06:54,128
It's very common.

817
01:07:00,658 --> 01:07:02,092
Toshio?

818
01:07:02,293 --> 01:07:06,027
In elementary school, could you do fractions?

819
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:12,736
When they said reverse the numerator and denominator, could you do it?

820
01:07:12,845 --> 01:07:15,680
I don't remember.

821
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:18,911
I wasn't bad at math though.

822
01:07:19,022 --> 01:07:20,388
I see.

823
01:07:20,658 --> 01:07:21,819
Lucky you.

824
01:07:21,927 --> 01:07:25,092
I bet you don't remember 'cause it was easy.

825
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:26,790
Maybe.

826
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,190
Why do you ask?

827
01:07:28,906 --> 01:07:34,207
It seems that people who could do it went on to have easy lives.

828
01:07:35,984 --> 01:07:44,821
One girl, completely average ...not even good at math, always could do it perfect right away.

829
01:07:44,966 --> 01:07:51,134
She grew up really normal and now has two kids.

830
01:07:53,749 --> 01:07:56,618
I was no good at it.

831
01:07:56,954 --> 01:07:59,925
Not smart enough to know when to quit.

832
01:08:04,366 --> 01:08:19,549
Room 5, Taeko Okajima. 25 points Before the test...

833
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:25,460
...we had art class.

834
01:08:26,938 --> 01:08:30,342
And... um... we did blow pictures.

835
01:08:30,978 --> 01:08:32,105
Blow pictures?

836
01:08:33,126 --> 01:08:35,075
Yes.

837
01:08:35,095 --> 01:08:37,044
We drop paint on the paper...

838
01:08:37,657 --> 01:08:41,322
and blow patterns in it.

839
01:08:42,933 --> 01:08:43,831
And?

840
01:08:45,336 --> 01:08:49,241
You blow like this, really hard, right?

841
01:08:49,844 --> 01:08:51,142
Yes?

842
01:08:51,624 --> 01:08:54,336
So, I got a headache.

843
01:08:54,356 --> 01:08:57,068
From blowing so hard.

844
01:08:57,891 --> 01:08:59,587
That's why you did so badly?

845
01:08:59,694 --> 01:09:02,494
That's right.

846
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:05,195
I see.

847
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,678
Do you know the answers now?

848
01:09:14,419 --> 01:09:16,217
The correct answers?

849
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:18,653
Well...

850
01:09:19,427 --> 01:09:21,795
Have Yaeko help you with them.

851
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:23,592
Yaeko?!

852
01:09:23,769 --> 01:09:25,100
That's right.

853
01:09:26,106 --> 01:09:27,870
Or Nanako, whichever.

854
01:09:31,282 --> 01:09:33,012
I'll ask Nanako.

855
01:09:54,364 --> 01:09:56,678
Nanako's not back yet.

856
01:09:56,698 --> 01:09:59,012
Can I wait til after dinner?

857
01:10:08,244 --> 01:10:10,942
I'll ask Yaeko...

858
01:10:27,778 --> 01:10:29,371
Mother!

859
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:31,090
Mother!

860
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:32,041
Mother!

861
01:10:33,888 --> 01:10:35,790
What is this?!

862
01:10:36,459 --> 01:10:37,791
How on earth...?

863
01:10:37,905 --> 01:10:39,883
Please teach her.

864
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:41,881
She doesn't seem to get it.

865
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:47,007
But this is beyond belief!

866
01:10:47,111 --> 01:10:48,773
That's why I'm asking you...

867
01:10:48,881 --> 01:10:50,782
Is she alright in the head?

868
01:10:50,884 --> 01:10:52,911
Just help her.

869
01:10:53,455 --> 01:10:56,051
Normally this is easy.

870
01:10:56,226 --> 01:10:58,092
But that child's not normal!

871
01:11:12,455 --> 01:11:16,918
Taeko, your sister's going to help.

872
01:11:18,398 --> 01:11:22,861
You had a headache from blowing, didn't you?

873
01:11:26,277 --> 01:11:27,540
Sit.

874
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:34,448
Say your times table from the top.

875
01:11:34,568 --> 01:11:36,148
I know that.

876
01:11:36,168 --> 01:11:37,748
I'm in fif th grade already!

877
01:11:38,432 --> 01:11:41,198
Then why so many mistakes?!

878
01:11:41,303 --> 01:11:43,899
It's dividing fractions.

879
01:11:50,218 --> 01:11:55,023
Just flip the top and the bottom and multiply.

880
01:11:55,127 --> 01:11:57,597
They taught you that, right?

881
01:11:59,334 --> 01:12:01,360
Then why do you get it wrong?

882
01:12:01,638 --> 01:12:04,769
Yaeko, one step at a time.

883
01:12:09,218 --> 01:12:12,348
What's dividing a fraction by a fraction anyway?

884
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:23,469
Two-thirds of an apple divided by a quarter means...

885
01:12:24,043 --> 01:12:30,045
how would this divide between four people, right?

886
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:38,766
So, it's one, two, three, four, five, six...

887
01:12:38,868 --> 01:12:40,996
one-sixth each, right?

888
01:12:43,152 --> 01:12:44,549
No, no, no, no.

889
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:45,966
That's multiplication.

890
01:12:46,381 --> 01:12:49,751
How come it's less when you multiply?

891
01:12:50,288 --> 01:12:54,159
Two-thirds of an apple divided by a quarter...

892
01:12:57,967 --> 01:12:58,957
Anyway!

893
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:03,007
Forget about apples...

894
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:07,607
just remember to inverse and multiply.

895
01:13:16,198 --> 01:13:18,293
Is her sister in Takarazuka?

896
01:13:18,413 --> 01:13:18,746
No, S.

897
01:13:18,766 --> 01:13:19,099
K.

898
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:19,452
D.

899
01:13:20,516 --> 01:13:22,226
- She got "D" in math.

900
01:13:22,246 --> 01:13:23,956
- "D"?

901
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:27,175
Yes, and just barely.

902
01:13:29,689 --> 01:13:33,218
If she got half right, it'd be worth scolding her.

903
01:13:33,328 --> 01:13:35,059
Right.

904
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,828
Should you get her IQ checked?

905
01:13:38,937 --> 01:13:41,635
They said it was fine when she started.

906
01:13:41,742 --> 01:13:43,405
Maybe she turned dumb?

907
01:13:43,512 --> 01:13:46,312
Remember she fell downstairs as a baby?

908
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:49,149
Right, in her walker!

909
01:13:49,389 --> 01:13:51,290
I thought she was dead.

910
01:13:51,392 --> 01:13:53,328
It was just a bump.

911
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,897
It's affecting her now.

912
01:13:54,998 --> 01:13:56,660
That's it!

913
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:59,563
Nonsense.

914
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:01,766
She's just no good at math.

915
01:14:01,877 --> 01:14:04,575
She chats too much in class.

916
01:14:04,715 --> 01:14:09,246
If she'd just listen,; even an idiot can do it.

917
01:14:09,356 --> 01:14:13,659
It's only two more years until Junior High.

918
01:14:13,774 --> 01:14:18,224
Two-thirds of this apple, divided by a quarter...

919
01:14:18,244 --> 01:14:22,694
I can't even picture it.

920
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:29,953
Two-thirds of this, into a quarter makes it...

921
01:14:35,468 --> 01:14:40,841
Even now, dividing fractions is difficult.

922
01:14:46,219 --> 01:14:50,784
We farmers give up too easily.

923
01:14:50,994 --> 01:14:56,128
We just yield to the flow and follow what they do in the cities.

924
01:14:56,236 --> 01:14:59,139
Let's rethink the real meaning of prosperity.

925
01:14:59,241 --> 01:15:03,237
Return to the old ways of farming.

926
01:15:04,517 --> 01:15:06,110
Wow...

927
01:15:08,023 --> 01:15:11,085
So, that explains the organic farming?

928
01:15:15,002 --> 01:15:18,064
I'm just quoting my friend.

929
01:15:18,608 --> 01:15:21,010
But I agree with it.

930
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:26,685
It's great the way you hold onto your memories of math class.

931
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:30,123
It wasn't meant to impress you.

932
01:15:30,361 --> 01:15:38,772
People say you work in a great place but I could never give myself up to it completely.

933
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:45,285
I really admire your devotion to farming.

934
01:15:47,056 --> 01:15:49,424
You re being sarcastic?

935
01:15:49,994 --> 01:15:52,294
Of course not!

936
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:54,926
There aren't many people like you.

937
01:15:59,044 --> 01:16:01,981
Farming's in total decline, right?

938
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:06,649
So we can't just carry on as normal.

939
01:16:06,756 --> 01:16:09,522
We've got to think about the future.

940
01:16:09,728 --> 01:16:16,702
We help each other out, cheer one another along, otherwise we can't keep it up.

941
01:16:22,684 --> 01:16:24,243
Taeko do you ski?

942
01:16:24,654 --> 01:16:28,491
I've been with friends a few times.

943
01:16:28,604 --> 01:16:30,616
Come next winter.

944
01:16:30,636 --> 01:16:32,648
I'll teach you.

945
01:16:32,768 --> 01:16:34,999
Are you good?

946
01:16:35,305 --> 01:16:39,769
No, but I'm an instructor there.

947
01:16:39,957 --> 01:16:41,536
An instructor?

948
01:16:41,556 --> 01:16:43,135
You must be great.

949
01:16:43,396 --> 01:16:45,010
All my friends are too.

950
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:46,644
It's nothing.

951
01:17:09,664 --> 01:17:15,300
At last, we're in the middle of nowhere.

952
01:17:17,177 --> 01:17:18,236
"Nowhere" huh?

953
01:17:18,355 --> 01:17:19,900
Sorry.

954
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,465
I didn't mean it like that.

955
01:17:22,386 --> 01:17:24,412
Interesting point though.

956
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:33,495
City people see the trees and rivers and are grateful for "nature".

957
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:38,980
But what you see here is all made by man.

958
01:17:39,882 --> 01:17:40,975
By man?

959
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:42,619
Farmers.

960
01:17:47,305 --> 01:17:48,270
- That wood?

961
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:49,255
- Yes.

962
01:17:49,909 --> 01:17:50,788
- Those trees?

963
01:17:50,808 --> 01:17:51,687
- Yes.

964
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,090
- That stream?

965
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:54,120
- Yes.

966
01:17:54,841 --> 01:18:05,757
Every bit has its history, not just the fields and rice paddies, someone's Great-Great Grandpa planted it, or cleared it, gathered firewood or picked mushrooms there.

967
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:08,159
I see.

968
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:13,666
Mankind battles nature and receives from it.

969
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:16,767
They evolve together, and create this scenery.

970
01:18:17,346 --> 01:18:21,445
So without man, this wouldn't exist?

971
01:18:23,056 --> 01:18:27,223
Farmers can't exist without nature.

972
01:18:28,064 --> 01:18:35,601
So they've always taken great care to give her a helping hand in return.

973
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:41,677
A collaboration between man and nature...

974
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:44,790
That's the heart of country life.

975
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:49,898
That's why I feel so at home.

976
01:18:50,669 --> 01:18:53,037
I didn't grow up here, but somehow always felt...

977
01:18:53,174 --> 01:18:57,774
my soul was at home here.

978
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:02,985
So that's it...

979
01:19:51,975 --> 01:19:54,468
My back aches.

980
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:59,285
What's so great about organic farming?

981
01:20:00,532 --> 01:20:02,863
Only the theory.

982
01:20:02,883 --> 01:20:05,214
Like I said...

983
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:08,825
giving nature a hand is hard work.

984
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:12,332
Things haven't changed in a hundred years.

985
01:20:12,643 --> 01:20:17,083
No, even "organic" rice uses weed-killer.

986
01:20:17,184 --> 01:20:22,090
There's not enough labor to weed by hand.

987
01:20:24,864 --> 01:20:27,357
You're really working hard.

988
01:20:28,771 --> 01:20:30,603
How about some tea?

989
01:20:31,008 --> 01:20:32,738
Fantastic.

990
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,511
I felt like a break.

991
01:20:43,395 --> 01:20:48,166
Toshio let me try a variety of things...

992
01:20:49,706 --> 01:20:53,577
...until I felt I knew all about country life.

993
01:21:22,696 --> 01:21:24,289
That's great...

994
01:21:43,441 --> 01:21:45,686
"Behold, the crows fly home.

995
01:21:45,706 --> 01:21:47,951
First one..."

996
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:53,476
At last I can say this in the right setting.

997
01:21:57,155 --> 01:22:00,285
It was my line in a school play.

998
01:22:00,394 --> 01:22:02,591
I was "Village Child A".

999
01:22:03,265 --> 01:22:05,234
Oh, I see.

1000
01:22:05,603 --> 01:22:09,736
I only ever had small roles too.

1001
01:22:09,843 --> 01:22:11,072
And you Naoko?

1002
01:22:11,179 --> 01:22:16,518
Only lead roles, since there are so few of us.

1003
01:22:16,622 --> 01:22:21,528
These days people leave and go to the cities.

1004
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:26,070
And now there are fewer kids.

1005
01:22:26,181 --> 01:22:28,677
I see.

1006
01:22:28,697 --> 01:22:31,193
But getting the big roles must be fun.

1007
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:33,249
Not really.

1008
01:22:33,269 --> 01:22:35,128
I prefer sports.

1009
01:22:35,148 --> 01:22:37,007
I'm a pretty fast runner.

1010
01:22:37,467 --> 01:22:39,212
Good for you.

1011
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,977
I was always mediocre.

1012
01:22:41,097 --> 01:22:48,641
The sports version of "Village Child A" Still, I'll never forget that line as long as I live.

1013
01:22:48,809 --> 01:22:53,307
It was going to make me a star.

1014
01:22:53,418 --> 01:22:54,385
A star?

1015
01:22:54,486 --> 01:22:55,476
Yes.

1016
01:22:55,621 --> 01:22:56,748
What kind of star?

1017
01:22:56,857 --> 01:22:58,189
That tiny role?

1018
01:22:58,693 --> 01:22:59,683
Yes.

1019
01:23:00,363 --> 01:23:02,457
Even though you weren't the lead?

1020
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:03,596
Yes.

1021
01:23:03,702 --> 01:23:05,967
Because I was the most enthusiastic.

1022
01:23:07,709 --> 01:23:09,200
Cause you were the cutest?

1023
01:23:09,745 --> 01:23:11,840
No, not that!

1024
01:23:12,517 --> 01:23:15,215
I rehearsed endlessly in front of the mirror.

1025
01:23:15,522 --> 01:23:18,618
Even for "Village Child A"...

1026
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:24,704
The line was so short, I felt something missing.

1027
01:23:24,981 --> 01:23:27,363
"Behold, the crows fly home.

1028
01:23:27,383 --> 01:23:29,765
First one..."

1029
01:23:29,889 --> 01:23:31,036
I know.

1030
01:23:31,056 --> 01:23:32,203
You made up more!

1031
01:23:32,651 --> 01:23:34,017
Exactly.

1032
01:23:35,824 --> 01:23:41,425
Look up there, the crows fly home.

1033
01:23:43,012 --> 01:23:44,073
- First one...

1034
01:23:44,093 --> 01:23:45,154
- Then two...

1035
01:23:45,282 --> 01:23:46,395
- Then three...

1036
01:23:46,415 --> 01:23:47,528
- Then four...

1037
01:23:48,989 --> 01:23:50,716
Farewell dear crows.

1038
01:23:50,736 --> 01:23:52,463
You take care now.

1039
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:58,186
And your teacher loved it.

1040
01:23:58,295 --> 01:23:59,091
Just the opposite.

1041
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:01,591
Very good everyone.

1042
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:07,476
But let's stick to the script.

1043
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:21,225
after all that.

1044
01:24:21,334 --> 01:24:25,433
It wasn't a good line, so I didn't mind.

1045
01:24:25,842 --> 01:24:29,109
I wasn't discouraged at all.

1046
01:24:29,415 --> 01:24:34,446
I realized that I could act even when there were no lines.

1047
01:24:39,432 --> 01:24:42,597
Behold, the crows fly home.

1048
01:24:47,623 --> 01:24:48,718
- First one.

1049
01:24:48,738 --> 01:24:49,833
- Then two.

1050
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,056
- Then three.

1051
01:24:51,076 --> 01:24:52,172
- Then four.

1052
01:25:13,657 --> 01:25:15,353
That was all.

1053
01:25:16,395 --> 01:25:21,062
It was worth the effort. "Village Child A" was a hit.

1054
01:25:21,169 --> 01:25:23,332
Believe it or not.

1055
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:27,118
People asked if I'd had lessons.

1056
01:25:27,138 --> 01:25:30,238
Teachers praised me...

1057
01:25:30,753 --> 01:25:34,020
Then something amazing happened.

1058
01:25:37,598 --> 01:25:39,032
Anyone home?

1059
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:39,994
Coming.

1060
01:25:40,102 --> 01:25:45,476
...and then the dynamite blew up right in my face!

1061
01:25:45,579 --> 01:25:47,172
...right in my face!

1062
01:25:47,892 --> 01:25:48,618
What?

1063
01:25:48,638 --> 01:25:49,364
Our Taeko?

1064
01:25:53,859 --> 01:25:59,095
We need a girl to star in our college play.

1065
01:26:00,938 --> 01:26:06,938
As a service to the community, please let your daughter perform.

1066
01:26:07,148 --> 01:26:08,480
A star!

1067
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:12,185
We'd rehearse Saturday afternoons.

1068
01:26:12,558 --> 01:26:15,154
We wouldn't take too long.

1069
01:26:15,262 --> 01:26:18,062
Well, but...

1070
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:21,703
Of course we'd bring her straight home.

1071
01:26:22,241 --> 01:26:23,971
I'll be in a real play.

1072
01:26:24,077 --> 01:26:28,176
Not with a bunch of kids but with real grown-ups!

1073
01:26:28,718 --> 01:26:29,913
I'll be a star!

1074
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:45,810
Oh, oh, oh, oh what a wonderful day Cock-a-doodle-doo!

1075
01:26:59,071 --> 01:27:00,505
Mother!

1076
01:27:01,451 --> 01:27:02,080
So?

1077
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:02,729
So?

1078
01:27:02,944 --> 01:27:06,677
A nice boy from the university wants you in their drama.

1079
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:10,414
You were so good in the school play.

1080
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,514
And?

1081
01:27:11,534 --> 01:27:12,248
And?

1082
01:27:13,128 --> 01:27:17,431
He practically begged me!

1083
01:27:24,414 --> 01:27:26,713
Wow that's great!

1084
01:27:26,817 --> 01:27:29,083
At least you're good at something.

1085
01:27:29,188 --> 01:27:31,920
She writes good essays too.

1086
01:27:32,026 --> 01:27:36,933
She's certainly better at that than she is at math.

1087
01:27:37,412 --> 01:27:38,223
That's right.

1088
01:27:38,243 --> 01:27:39,054
That's right.

1089
01:27:39,172 --> 01:27:44,443
I was lead in "The Poor Sparrow" but no one came for me.

1090
01:27:44,715 --> 01:27:46,479
You see, you see!

1091
01:27:46,919 --> 01:27:48,785
Are you going to do it?

1092
01:28:12,362 --> 01:28:15,561
This could lead to a career.

1093
01:28:16,837 --> 01:28:18,601
Join the Takarazuka Theater.

1094
01:28:18,706 --> 01:28:22,110
Start rehearsing now, it's perfect timing.

1095
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:25,282
Acting is out.

1096
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:29,182
Show business people are no good.

1097
01:28:29,959 --> 01:28:32,828
"Show business"... don't exaggerate...

1098
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:34,155
That's right.

1099
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:35,390
It's...

1100
01:28:35,501 --> 01:28:36,833
I said no.

1101
01:28:37,739 --> 01:28:38,398
Dinner.

1102
01:28:58,775 --> 01:29:01,301
Father's so stubborn.

1103
01:29:01,546 --> 01:29:05,348
Why did you have to mention a career?

1104
01:29:05,462 --> 01:29:07,025
- Can I bathe first?

1105
01:29:07,045 --> 01:29:08,608
- Sure.

1106
01:29:09,693 --> 01:29:11,424
Or Takarazuka...?

1107
01:29:12,074 --> 01:29:13,819
Or show business?

1108
01:29:13,839 --> 01:29:15,584
You know Dad...

1109
01:29:15,804 --> 01:29:20,107
Why did you say that Nanako?

1110
01:29:20,478 --> 01:29:22,242
That's enough.

1111
01:29:26,755 --> 01:29:36,262
Poor boy, poor boy, Don't you feel sorry for me?

1112
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:39,672
We won't take much of her time.

1113
01:29:39,945 --> 01:29:42,313
I know but...

1114
01:29:43,351 --> 01:29:45,583
I beg you.

1115
01:29:46,924 --> 01:29:50,191
She's rather shy...

1116
01:29:51,198 --> 01:29:54,533
the timid type...

1117
01:29:56,474 --> 01:30:01,141
Sorry you came so far for nothing.

1118
01:30:01,248 --> 01:30:06,451
Poor boy, poor boy...

1119
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:08,898
....

1120
01:30:08,918 --> 01:30:11,249
Such a long way from home...

1121
01:30:11,732 --> 01:30:30,595
Poor boy Aoki's going to play the part instead.

1122
01:30:31,099 --> 01:30:32,226
I see.

1123
01:30:34,071 --> 01:30:37,407
She's boasting to everyone.

1124
01:30:37,577 --> 01:30:38,544
I see.

1125
01:30:38,645 --> 01:30:46,549
Today her Mom met her at school to get her changed into a fancy dress.

1126
01:30:46,792 --> 01:30:49,888
A frilly thing out to here...

1127
01:30:51,434 --> 01:30:57,104
Don't tell anyone you got the first offer.

1128
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:03,151
Because that would hurt Aoki very much.

1129
01:31:08,162 --> 01:31:09,255
Do you understand?

1130
01:31:12,604 --> 01:31:13,502
Do you understand?

1131
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:52,272
Breaking through the waves Shooting through the clouds Where is it heading, Hyokkori Pumpkin Island?

1132
01:31:52,292 --> 01:32:00,464
Where will it take us?

1133
01:32:05,293 --> 01:32:28,832
Something special waits for us, just over the horizon There 'll be hard times, there 'll be sad times, but we'll never lose heart We hate to cry, so let's laugh instead Let's go!

1134
01:32:28,934 --> 01:32:34,204
Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!

1135
01:32:52,106 --> 01:32:54,542
Poor you.

1136
01:32:56,948 --> 01:33:00,886
I joined the drama group in high school.

1137
01:33:01,323 --> 01:33:05,456
I couldn't forget what had happened.

1138
01:33:05,897 --> 01:33:06,795
And then?

1139
01:33:07,566 --> 01:33:10,935
It was a lot of fun, acting and all...

1140
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:14,512
but it wasn't for me.

1141
01:33:14,532 --> 01:33:16,994
As for becoming a star...

1142
01:33:17,116 --> 01:33:19,210
that was a joke.

1143
01:33:19,353 --> 01:33:20,719
But...

1144
01:33:22,525 --> 01:33:27,295
I guess Dads are the same all over.

1145
01:33:29,236 --> 01:33:33,369
When I was in high school, I so wanted to live in Tokyo.

1146
01:33:36,616 --> 01:33:41,318
I even wrote to my cousin about schools there.

1147
01:33:42,259 --> 01:33:43,989
Did you really?

1148
01:33:45,307 --> 01:33:48,990
I gave up.

1149
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:52,693
But it annoyed me to hear other guys bragging about life in Tokyo.

1150
01:33:53,989 --> 01:33:55,904
Not anymore though.

1151
01:33:55,924 --> 01:33:57,839
I respect my dad...

1152
01:33:57,952 --> 01:34:00,012
He's an expert farmer.

1153
01:34:02,193 --> 01:34:04,857
But I know how you felt.

1154
01:34:04,964 --> 01:34:07,560
Mine's just a funny story.

1155
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:09,797
No it's the same, I understand.

1156
01:34:13,579 --> 01:34:18,885
But we'll never lose heart, we hate to cry, so let's laugh instead.

1157
01:34:19,422 --> 01:34:21,550
I also watched Hyokkori Pumpkin Island.

1158
01:34:21,927 --> 01:34:22,825
Really?

1159
01:34:23,463 --> 01:34:25,432
Machine Gun Dandy was so cool.

1160
01:34:25,532 --> 01:34:27,365
He was my hero!

1161
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:29,998
Of course.

1162
01:34:30,107 --> 01:34:33,670
Those songs were full of encouragement.

1163
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:36,376
What was that other one...?

1164
01:34:36,485 --> 01:34:54,109
"If today's no good, you'll have tomorrow" "If tomorrow's no good, you'll have the next day" "If that's no good, there'll be another" "There's always a tomorrow" What a weird song!

1165
01:34:56,519 --> 01:35:05,391
That song, about putting things off, Toshio took in a positive, affirmative way.

1166
01:35:06,168 --> 01:35:09,800
I liked his approach to life.

1167
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:26,633
You're going tomorrow?

1168
01:35:28,273 --> 01:35:33,373
Thank you for having me for so long.

1169
01:35:33,481 --> 01:35:35,417
Thank you, my dear.

1170
01:35:41,696 --> 01:35:45,226
Do you like it here?

1171
01:35:45,346 --> 01:35:47,529
Very much.

1172
01:35:47,549 --> 01:35:49,732
I feel so at home.

1173
01:35:49,843 --> 01:35:53,338
Glad to hear it.

1174
01:35:53,783 --> 01:35:56,982
I've lived here all my life.

1175
01:35:57,399 --> 01:36:00,231
Been to Tokyo just once.

1176
01:36:00,251 --> 01:36:03,083
For your sister's wedding.

1177
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:06,228
You think it's better than Tokyo?

1178
01:36:06,605 --> 01:36:08,540
Without a doubt.

1179
01:36:08,853 --> 01:36:11,633
Tokyo's packed with cars, buildings...

1180
01:36:11,653 --> 01:36:14,433
People shouldn't live like that.

1181
01:36:14,619 --> 01:36:17,852
This is a different world.

1182
01:36:17,958 --> 01:36:22,227
You really like it here then?

1183
01:36:22,342 --> 01:36:24,473
Yes.

1184
01:36:24,493 --> 01:36:26,624
The nice surroundings, the kind people...

1185
01:36:30,146 --> 01:36:31,774
Taeko.

1186
01:36:32,626 --> 01:36:34,439
Why don't you live here?

1187
01:36:34,459 --> 01:36:36,272
With Toshio?

1188
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:49,874
Since his brother moved to Tokyo, why don't you stay here and marry Toshio?

1189
01:36:49,979 --> 01:36:51,277
Granny!

1190
01:36:51,382 --> 01:36:54,683
Mother... you've gone too far!

1191
01:36:54,821 --> 01:36:57,291
Taeko's shocked.

1192
01:36:57,392 --> 01:37:00,761
Please think it over.

1193
01:37:01,576 --> 01:37:02,620
Don't pay any attention.

1194
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:03,684
She's joking.

1195
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:06,134
Joking, right, Granny?

1196
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:07,562
No.

1197
01:37:07,582 --> 01:37:08,894
I'm serious.

1198
01:37:09,011 --> 01:37:11,675
Don't deny you wouldn't like it.

1199
01:37:11,783 --> 01:37:16,018
It's not a matter of what we'd like...

1200
01:37:16,124 --> 01:37:18,890
Of course we'd love it.

1201
01:37:18,995 --> 01:37:24,494
But Taeko's a city person.

1202
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:25,630
Of course.

1203
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:34,321
But she loves it here, she works so hard on the land, it's a joy to watch.

1204
01:37:34,488 --> 01:37:38,825
There'd be nothing better than her marrying Toshio.

1205
01:37:38,939 --> 01:37:40,900
You're being rude.

1206
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,881
You're embarrasing her.

1207
01:37:43,581 --> 01:37:46,196
She's got a decent job in Tokyo.

1208
01:37:46,216 --> 01:37:48,831
Besides, she's older than him.

1209
01:37:48,947 --> 01:37:52,942
There are jobs in Yamagata too.

1210
01:37:54,422 --> 01:37:57,656
Please don't be angry.

1211
01:37:57,995 --> 01:38:02,492
Most of the young wives work these days, so...

1212
01:38:02,603 --> 01:38:05,905
What're you talking about?

1213
01:38:06,343 --> 01:38:11,181
She's only been here twice on holiday.

1214
01:38:11,418 --> 01:38:13,980
Suddenly bringing this up... you're upsetting her.

1215
01:38:14,089 --> 01:38:16,184
So you're against it?

1216
01:38:16,303 --> 01:38:18,566
I didn't say that.

1217
01:38:18,586 --> 01:38:20,849
I said let's be realistic.

1218
01:38:20,968 --> 01:38:25,340
We don't even know how Toshio feels.

1219
01:38:25,442 --> 01:38:28,414
One look at him and it's obvious.

1220
01:38:28,514 --> 01:38:34,286
Don't dismiss it before we've asked her.

1221
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:36,585
Taeko!

1222
01:38:42,237 --> 01:38:43,968
Let her be.

1223
01:38:46,488 --> 01:38:48,717
See what you did.

1224
01:38:48,737 --> 01:38:50,966
You can't rush these things.

1225
01:38:51,754 --> 01:38:54,782
I don't think I was wrong.

1226
01:39:09,518 --> 01:39:14,049
I'd never even thought of being a farmer's wife.

1227
01:39:14,994 --> 01:39:20,794
I was strangely moved, even imagining it might be possible.

1228
01:39:22,073 --> 01:39:28,839
If only I could've replied: "I'd love to... ." like in a movie.

1229
01:39:29,952 --> 01:39:31,511
But I couldn't.

1230
01:39:32,924 --> 01:39:39,660
Suddenly my love of the country, and my play-farming, seemed so phony.

1231
01:39:41,005 --> 01:39:48,817
Declaring my love for country life based on a ten day vacation, now felt so embarrassing.

1232
01:39:50,488 --> 01:39:53,118
Then with no warning....

1233
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,956
everyone seeing right through me.

1234
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:00,299
It was unbearable.

1235
01:40:07,383 --> 01:40:08,908
I ain't shaking hands with you.

1236
01:40:12,024 --> 01:40:14,859
That shirt he wore today....

1237
01:40:14,962 --> 01:40:15,691
What about it?

1238
01:40:15,798 --> 01:40:18,530
Tanaka 's old shirt.

1239
01:40:18,702 --> 01:40:20,000
Don't tell anyone.

1240
01:40:20,105 --> 01:40:25,809
When it's his turn to feed the ducks, he takes the bread home.

1241
01:40:25,915 --> 01:40:29,284
Did you see his hands?

1242
01:40:29,387 --> 01:40:31,186
Glad he's not sitting next to me.

1243
01:40:31,858 --> 01:40:33,326
Poor Taeko.

1244
01:40:33,427 --> 01:40:35,863
Have him switch places.

1245
01:40:35,965 --> 01:40:39,563
He should sit with the boys.

1246
01:40:39,672 --> 01:40:41,231
Right Taeko?

1247
01:40:42,109 --> 01:40:45,206
I don't mind.

1248
01:40:45,448 --> 01:40:47,679
You shouldn't talk like that.

1249
01:40:47,952 --> 01:40:49,512
You don't mind?

1250
01:40:49,622 --> 01:40:51,250
Don't be a goody-goody.

1251
01:40:51,725 --> 01:40:54,696
Don't you dare tell anyone what we said.

1252
01:40:59,439 --> 01:41:01,032
I'll beat you up!

1253
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:09,683
Don't go!

1254
01:41:22,611 --> 01:41:24,341
What are you doing out here?

1255
01:41:25,059 --> 01:41:26,604
Nothing.

1256
01:41:26,624 --> 01:41:28,169
Taking a walk.

1257
01:41:28,298 --> 01:41:30,543
You're getting wet.

1258
01:41:30,563 --> 01:41:32,808
Quick, get in.

1259
01:41:49,290 --> 01:41:51,020
A little souvenir.

1260
01:41:51,962 --> 01:41:53,521
Some of Mom's pickles.

1261
01:42:00,409 --> 01:42:02,674
Please don't go back yet.

1262
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:04,111
Why not?

1263
01:42:04,216 --> 01:42:07,415
Just drive... anywhere.

1264
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:09,423
Something wrong?

1265
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:14,800
I knew a boy named Abe.

1266
01:42:16,413 --> 01:42:18,511
He came from another school.

1267
01:42:18,531 --> 01:42:20,629
He sat next to me.

1268
01:42:22,313 --> 01:42:27,578
He once said, "I ain't shaking hands with you."

1269
01:42:52,642 --> 01:42:55,576
His family was poor.

1270
01:42:55,596 --> 01:42:58,530
He never had sports gear.

1271
01:42:59,444 --> 01:43:04,111
Always picking his nose or wiping it on his sleeve...

1272
01:43:04,218 --> 01:43:13,531
And if I complained or even dared frown at him, he'd threaten to hit me.

1273
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:18,861
I hated it.

1274
01:43:18,881 --> 01:43:22,562
I longed for the end of the term, so we could change seats.

1275
01:43:24,152 --> 01:43:33,464
I hated holding hands in dance class, hated having to lend him my homework.

1276
01:43:36,073 --> 01:43:41,343
The girls gossiped and called him names.

1277
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:47,157
But I wouldn't join in.

1278
01:43:47,626 --> 01:43:52,430
I thought it was terrible to talk behind his back.

1279
01:43:54,438 --> 01:43:55,496
But one day...

1280
01:43:56,441 --> 01:44:01,006
He was transferred in the middle of the term.

1281
01:44:02,050 --> 01:44:06,752
The teacher made us all shake hands and say goodbye.

1282
01:44:08,295 --> 01:44:11,528
A feeling of disgust swept the room.

1283
01:44:14,071 --> 01:44:18,204
His hands were filthy.

1284
01:44:20,181 --> 01:44:27,984
Walking around, shaking hands with us, he looked so nervous.

1285
01:44:30,699 --> 01:44:35,470
Back at his own desk, only I was left.

1286
01:44:38,246 --> 01:44:47,083
When I held out my hand he said, "I ain't shaking hands with you."

1287
01:44:50,199 --> 01:44:52,601
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

1288
01:45:00,817 --> 01:45:04,482
I hated him the most.

1289
01:45:06,494 --> 01:45:09,761
He knew that.

1290
01:45:11,068 --> 01:45:13,436
That's why he didn't shake my hand.

1291
01:45:20,985 --> 01:45:23,114
What happened at the farmhouse?

1292
01:45:23,790 --> 01:45:28,492
Ever since I was little...

1293
01:45:30,435 --> 01:45:32,529
I just pretend to be nice.

1294
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:35,008
Nothing's changed.

1295
01:45:46,138 --> 01:45:47,916
You're strange, today.

1296
01:45:47,936 --> 01:45:49,714
Not the usual you.

1297
01:45:52,572 --> 01:45:54,872
I don't know what happened, but...

1298
01:45:55,043 --> 01:45:58,880
It's nothing to do with that.

1299
01:46:03,090 --> 01:46:04,558
I'm sorry.

1300
01:46:05,962 --> 01:46:11,131
I just feel bad about what happened.

1301
01:46:13,675 --> 01:46:17,978
I think that boy was stupid.

1302
01:46:18,316 --> 01:46:23,154
Maybe he didn't shake your hand because he liked you.

1303
01:46:23,258 --> 01:46:27,823
No, he liked the class president.

1304
01:46:27,966 --> 01:46:29,935
He was always acting tough with me.

1305
01:46:30,036 --> 01:46:40,416
Hands in pockets, spitting, swearing, swaggering along, ...showing off.

1306
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:42,046
Exactly.

1307
01:46:42,334 --> 01:46:45,482
I know how he feels.

1308
01:46:45,502 --> 01:46:48,650
When I was little, I used to bully the girl I liked.

1309
01:46:48,768 --> 01:46:50,567
That's not it.

1310
01:46:50,672 --> 01:46:55,112
He shook hands with everyone but me.

1311
01:46:55,613 --> 01:46:58,448
There's the problem.

1312
01:46:59,353 --> 01:47:02,119
Girls never understand how boys feel.

1313
01:47:02,859 --> 01:47:04,761
As if you know...

1314
01:47:05,196 --> 01:47:07,393
Let me guess, then...

1315
01:47:08,201 --> 01:47:11,536
He wasn't that tough.

1316
01:47:12,085 --> 01:47:14,752
He couldn't bully any boys.

1317
01:47:14,772 --> 01:47:17,439
He had no friends.

1318
01:47:20,156 --> 01:47:25,028
You sat next to him, an easy target.

1319
01:47:25,664 --> 01:47:28,659
He needed you to be tough with.

1320
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:32,708
No way he wanted to shake hands with everyone.

1321
01:47:32,811 --> 01:47:38,218
He could only prove how tough he was with you.

1322
01:48:03,729 --> 01:48:05,756
Don't be filthy!

1323
01:48:50,142 --> 01:48:57,985
I felt so guilty and so sorry for him that I began copying him.

1324
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:02,061
Too late though, huh?

1325
01:49:02,263 --> 01:49:08,271
I couldn't take back the pain I caused him.

1326
01:49:17,088 --> 01:49:20,083
It's stopped raining.

1327
01:49:20,728 --> 01:49:22,356
Oh, yes.

1328
01:49:27,139 --> 01:49:28,732
The moon's out.

1329
01:49:39,092 --> 01:49:42,963
Sometimes at night you see raccoons here.

1330
01:49:45,236 --> 01:49:46,465
Shall we go back?

1331
01:49:46,571 --> 01:49:50,670
They must be worried about me.

1332
01:49:53,851 --> 01:49:57,448
This'll be the talk of the town.

1333
01:49:57,934 --> 01:49:59,696
I'm sorry.

1334
01:49:59,716 --> 01:50:01,478
You've been so kind.

1335
01:50:02,332 --> 01:50:05,063
I wonder what happened at the house, though?

1336
01:50:05,171 --> 01:50:09,975
Please, for my sake, don't ask anyone.

1337
01:50:13,685 --> 01:50:15,916
Shall I play that music?

1338
01:50:54,688 --> 01:51:03,967
I began to think of my feelings for him, and of his feelings for me, for the very first time.

1339
01:51:07,944 --> 01:51:14,218
How come he seemed to sort out my mixed-up thoughts?

1340
01:51:14,956 --> 01:51:19,521
How come I let him get so close?

1341
01:51:21,066 --> 01:51:25,130
Somehow he seemed older than me.

1342
01:51:26,375 --> 01:51:32,546
He was the one I wanted to shake hands with.

1343
01:51:35,257 --> 01:51:36,851
Just shake hands?

1344
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:11,117
What was this feeling?

1345
01:52:12,488 --> 01:52:16,928
My mind raced as I sat beside him.

1346
01:52:43,941 --> 01:52:46,002
Have you got everything?

1347
01:52:46,112 --> 01:52:47,842
Yes, I'm fine.

1348
01:52:48,048 --> 01:52:50,245
We'll see you in the winter.

1349
01:52:50,353 --> 01:52:54,223
I'll do my farming homework.

1350
01:52:54,325 --> 01:52:56,591
What about skiing?

1351
01:52:56,996 --> 01:52:59,364
That just takes practice.

1352
01:52:59,901 --> 01:53:03,101
Consider what I said, Taeko.

1353
01:53:03,375 --> 01:53:04,673
What's that?

1354
01:53:04,777 --> 01:53:05,505
What?

1355
01:53:05,912 --> 01:53:09,714
That's our secret.

1356
01:53:10,353 --> 01:53:13,654
Something was strange yesterday.

1357
01:53:13,769 --> 01:53:16,902
Sorry.

1358
01:53:16,922 --> 01:53:20,055
Next time I'll be fine, I'll leave the ten year-old me, at home.

1359
01:53:33,426 --> 01:53:35,122
Wait for me!

1360
01:53:36,364 --> 01:53:38,197
Take care Naoko.

1361
01:53:47,516 --> 01:53:48,882
Goodbye.

1362
01:54:29,188 --> 01:54:43,169
Some say love, it is a river that drowns the tender reed.

1363
01:54:44,948 --> 01:54:59,597
Some say love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed.

1364
01:55:01,008 --> 01:55:15,627
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need.

1365
01:55:17,136 --> 01:55:32,250
I say love, it is a flower, and you its only seed.

1366
01:55:37,237 --> 01:55:51,690
It's the heart, afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance.

1367
01:55:52,530 --> 01:56:07,011
It's the dream, afraid of waking, that never takes a chance.

1368
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:14,858
It's the one who won't be taken.

1369
01:56:16,071 --> 01:56:23,038
Who cannot seem to give.

1370
01:56:24,117 --> 01:56:39,838
And the soul, afraid of dyin', that never learns to live.

1371
01:56:43,817 --> 01:57:29,453
When the night has been too Ionely and the road has been too long, And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong, Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows.

1372
01:57:30,965 --> 01:57:48,053
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love, in the Spring becomes the Rose.
