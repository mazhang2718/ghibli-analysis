1
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:44,050
HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE Miss Sophie, I've closed up the shop.

2
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:46,677
You should come too, Sophie.

3
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:48,356
I'll just finish this.

4
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:49,836
Go have some fun.

5
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:51,932
All right, then, I'm off.

6
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:54,226
I'm going.

7
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:57,313
Look, it's Howl's castle.

8
00:01:57,531 --> 00:01:57,970
What?

9
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,429
Howl?

10
00:01:58,449 --> 00:01:58,888
Where, where?

11
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:00,941
Look how close it is.

12
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:03,027
Oh, no!

13
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:05,154
I wonder if Howl's in town.

14
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:14,246
It took off.

15
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:17,166
No, just hiding from all the soldiers.

16
00:02:17,385 --> 00:02:18,678
Say, did you hear?

17
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:19,991
Remember Martha, from South Haven?

18
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:22,296
They say Howl tore her heart out.

19
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:23,214
How scary...

20
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:26,217
Don't worry, he's not going to want yours.

21
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:28,886
Hurry up.

22
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:32,264
Really?

23
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:34,934
Oh, cut it out...

24
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:37,932
Hey there little mouse, lost your way?

25
00:04:38,442 --> 00:04:39,256
Oh, no...

26
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:40,090
I'm fine.

27
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:42,363
Then how about a cup of tea?

28
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,968
Care to join me?

29
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:48,567
- No thank you, I'm busy - She sure is a cute little mouse.

30
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:49,808
Say, how old are you?

31
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:50,850
You live around here?

32
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:52,738
Let me pass!

33
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:56,241
See, it's those whiskers of yours.

34
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,702
She's even cuter when she's mad.

35
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:00,245
Hey, there, I'm sorry.

36
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:02,623
Where've you been?

37
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,469
- Who are you?

38
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:05,658
- I'm with her.

39
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:08,629
Why don't you two take a little walk?

40
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:17,471
Don't hold it against them.

41
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:19,890
They're harmless.

42
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:21,632
Where to?

43
00:05:21,652 --> 00:05:23,175
I'll be your escort.

44
00:05:23,602 --> 00:05:25,813
No, really, I'm only going to Cesari's.

45
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:27,471
Act normal.

46
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:28,514
I'm being followed.

47
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:29,900
Just walk.

48
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:53,048
Sorry, I got you involved.

49
00:05:57,302 --> 00:05:57,886
This way.

50
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:06,478
Hold on.

51
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:14,987
Drop your legs, keep walking.

52
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,786
That's right, don't be frightened.

53
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,761
Very nice.

54
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:56,486
I'll draw them off.

55
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:58,322
Wait here until the coast is clear.

56
00:06:59,031 --> 00:06:59,990
Yes.

57
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:02,159
That's my girl.

58
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:16,350
- Any chocolate Letties?

59
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,705
- Look this way, Lettie.

60
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:18,916
- Hey, make room.

61
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:19,917
- Let's go for a walk, Lettie.

62
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:20,969
My sister?

63
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:24,431
Come back soon, Lettie.

64
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:29,311
Sophie?

65
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:34,358
How did you land on the veranda like that?

66
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:36,328
Have you become an angel?

67
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:37,558
It feels like I'm in a dream...

68
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:39,905
Lettie, why not use the office?

69
00:07:40,113 --> 00:07:43,450
Thanks, but I should really be working.

70
00:07:44,795 --> 00:07:46,485
What?

71
00:07:46,505 --> 00:07:48,195
You sure he wasn't a wizard?

72
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,207
He was so kind...

73
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:53,293
He rescued me...

74
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:56,088
Don't tell me he's stolen your heart.

75
00:07:56,922 --> 00:08:00,801
If that was the wizard Howl, he'd have eaten it right up.

76
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:04,805
Don't worry, Howl's only after beauties.

77
00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:06,682
There you go again.

78
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,060
Listen to me, we live in dangerous times.

79
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:11,655
They say even the Witch of the Waste.

80
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:13,052
Is back on the prowl.

81
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:16,191
Sophie?

82
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:18,860
Oh, you...

83
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:23,532
Lettie, the Madeleines are done.

84
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:25,867
Okay, be right there.

85
00:08:26,076 --> 00:08:27,285
All right.

86
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:30,706
I'm going home.

87
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:32,958
It's a relief to know you're doing well.

88
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:36,044
Hello, Lettie.

89
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:37,295
Nice to see you.

90
00:08:37,796 --> 00:08:41,258
Listen, are you going to spend your whole life in that shop?

91
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:44,970
It meant so much to Papa.

92
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:46,388
Besides, I'm the eldest.

93
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:48,974
That's not what I meant.

94
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:50,600
Are you sure you want to be a hatter?

95
00:08:51,143 --> 00:08:52,060
Well, I...

96
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,594
- Bye, Lettie!

97
00:08:53,614 --> 00:08:54,929
- Come by the shop next time.

98
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:55,939
Sure.

99
00:08:56,148 --> 00:08:57,107
I'll be on my way.

100
00:08:57,315 --> 00:09:00,986
Sophie, you've got to look out for yourself.

101
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:11,306
Sorry, the shop's closed.

102
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:13,892
I thought I'd locked the door.

103
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:20,899
What a cheap shop, full of cheap little hats.

104
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,028
And you're quite cheap-looking yourself.

105
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:29,032
This is just a simple hat shop.

106
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:37,249
I think you had better leave.

107
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,753
You're very brave, taking on the Witch of the Waste.

108
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,964
The Witch of the Waste?

109
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,933
You won't be able to tell anyone about that spell.

110
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:57,394
My regards to Howl.

111
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,817
Is this really me!

112
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:48,194
I've got to stay calm.

113
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:06,379
I've got to calm down.

114
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:09,466
It's no use panicking, Sophie.

115
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:13,636
I'll be fine, I'll be fine.

116
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:19,517
I've got to calm down.

117
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:32,322
I'm back!

118
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,324
Welcome home, Ma'am!

119
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,024
How do you like it?

120
00:12:36,044 --> 00:12:37,526
It's all the rage in Kingsbury.

121
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:38,776
- Amazing!

122
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:39,818
- It suits you.

123
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:41,697
Don't you think it's wonderful?

124
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,199
Sophie!

125
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:47,472
Mrs.

126
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:49,995
Hatter, Sophie hasn't come down to work yet I wonder what's the matter?

127
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,093
Sophie!

128
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:02,685
Don't come in!

129
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:05,104
I've got an awful cold!

130
00:13:05,313 --> 00:13:06,856
I don't want you to catch it.

131
00:13:07,815 --> 00:13:09,651
You sound just awful...

132
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:11,736
Like some 90 year-old woman.

133
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:14,614
I'll stay in bed today.

134
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:16,084
You sure?

135
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:17,356
All right, then.

136
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:21,704
Here we go...

137
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:34,676
You'll be fine, old lady.

138
00:13:34,884 --> 00:13:38,972
You're still healthy, and these clothes finally suit you.

139
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:43,726
But I can't stay here.

140
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:55,905
Ouch, ouch!

141
00:13:56,406 --> 00:13:58,658
It's not easy being old.

142
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:11,421
They're saying this war is going to be terrible...

143
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,393
Like a hand, granny?

144
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,355
Such a gentleman, but I'll manage.

145
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:33,151
Sure, old lady, but where are you off to?

146
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:35,778
Just a bit farther than where you're going.

147
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:42,577
I don't recommend it, granny.

148
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:45,329
Nothing but witches and wizards ahead.

149
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:47,290
Thank you.

150
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,293
Going to the Folding Valley, at this hour?

151
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:52,795
Says her youngest sister's there.

152
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,937
I've hardly made any progress at all.

153
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:15,109
Thank goodness I've still got my teeth.

154
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:24,494
That'll make a good cane.

155
00:15:24,744 --> 00:15:26,621
Up we go.

156
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,171
Might be a bit too thick.

157
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:45,348
Ouch, ouch!

158
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,642
What a stubborn branch.

159
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:52,563
Never underestimate Grandma Sophie.

160
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:54,398
Heave!

161
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:06,577
A scarecrow, eh?

162
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:09,455
I thought you were working for the Witch.

163
00:16:09,872 --> 00:16:12,667
But how do you stand by yourself?

164
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:17,380
Your head's a turnip.

165
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:21,133
I've always hated turnips.

166
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:23,844
At least you're not upside down anymore.

167
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:25,680
So long.

168
00:16:32,937 --> 00:16:34,647
It's so cold.

169
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:37,358
The town's still so close.

170
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:44,323
Don't follow me!

171
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:47,493
You don't owe me a thing.

172
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:49,912
You must be a magical whatever-you-are.

173
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:52,915
I've had enough of witches and spells!

174
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:56,294
Just go stand wherever you like!

175
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:25,114
This is a perfect cane Thank you kindly While you're at it, could you bring me a house to sleep in?

176
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:38,961
Seems you get more cunning with age.

177
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:51,807
What a huge battleship.

178
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:58,564
I never realized how weak you feel when you get old.

179
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:16,499
I smell smoke.

180
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:19,335
Maybe there's a cabin.

181
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:41,649
Turnip-head, isn't that Howl's Castle?

182
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:45,820
This is hardly what I meant when I asked for shelter!

183
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:58,332
What is this?

184
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,834
You call this a castle?

185
00:19:20,187 --> 00:19:22,147
Is that the way in?

186
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:26,068
Just wait up there!

187
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:29,905
Hey, there!

188
00:19:31,198 --> 00:19:33,909
Are you going to let me on, or not!

189
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:40,374
My shawl!

190
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:55,192
It seems warm enough inside, Turnip.

191
00:19:55,212 --> 00:19:57,007
I'm going in.

192
00:19:57,224 --> 00:19:58,309
Thank you.

193
00:19:58,517 --> 00:20:02,313
Even Howl wouldn't want an ancient heart like mine.

194
00:20:05,232 --> 00:20:06,859
This time, it's really goodbye.

195
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:11,989
You may be a turnip, but you're a good turnip May you find happiness.

196
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:00,662
What is this place?

197
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:03,373
Just looks like a dilapidated heap.

198
00:21:12,174 --> 00:21:28,565
Well, one nice thing about getting old is that nothing surprises you anymore That's some spell you're under.

199
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:32,569
It won't be easy to break.

200
00:21:34,238 --> 00:21:35,572
The fire talked!

201
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:38,075
And you can't even tell anyone about it.

202
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:40,119
You're Howl?

203
00:21:40,337 --> 00:21:42,528
Wrong.

204
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:44,739
I'm the fire demon, Calcifer!

205
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:49,461
Well, then, Calcifer, can you break the spell I'm under?

206
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:56,510
Easy If you break the spell that chains me to this place, I'll break your spell in a flash.

207
00:21:57,469 --> 00:22:00,097
In other words, bargain with a demon.

208
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:02,683
You sure you can keep that promise?

209
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,352
Demons don't make promises.

210
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:08,355
I suggest you look elsewhere.

211
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,816
But I'm an exploited demon!

212
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:14,361
I'm chained here by a contract with Howl, who works me to death.

213
00:22:14,653 --> 00:22:17,614
I'm the one who keeps this castle moving.

214
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:21,285
My, you've got it rough.

215
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:25,831
If you figure out the secret contract, the spell will break.

216
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,834
If you do that, I'll break your spell, too.

217
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:31,472
All right.

218
00:22:31,492 --> 00:22:33,369
A bargain, eh?

219
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,970
Granny!

220
00:22:40,178 --> 00:22:41,555
Granny!

221
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:47,238
Boy...

222
00:22:47,258 --> 00:22:48,218
I've got my doubts about her.

223
00:23:42,616 --> 00:23:44,159
Hey, who's this?

224
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:45,952
Porthaven!

225
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:48,163
When did she get in?

226
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:56,713
Stand by!

227
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:02,677
Why, Mayor, sir!

228
00:24:02,896 --> 00:24:04,773
The sun is already high.

229
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:06,670
Is Master Jenkins at home?

230
00:24:07,182 --> 00:24:08,975
The Master is out.

231
00:24:09,184 --> 00:24:11,686
I answer in his stead.

232
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:15,148
An invitation from His Majesty.

233
00:24:15,357 --> 00:24:16,525
It has come to war.

234
00:24:16,983 --> 00:24:22,489
His Majesty desires every wizard and magician, even the witches, to aid our homeland.

235
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:24,314
His presence is imperative.

236
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:25,941
That is all.

237
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:30,163
War, how awful.

238
00:24:31,164 --> 00:24:33,041
And who might you be?

239
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,418
Calcifer let me in.

240
00:24:35,637 --> 00:24:37,181
Don't look at me.

241
00:24:37,201 --> 00:24:38,745
She wandered in from the Wastes.

242
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:40,382
The Wastes?

243
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,124
That's strange.

244
00:24:42,144 --> 00:24:43,668
You're not a witch, are you?

245
00:24:44,594 --> 00:24:46,680
A witch could never get in.

246
00:24:47,305 --> 00:24:48,974
Porthaven, again!

247
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:51,393
A customer?

248
00:24:53,353 --> 00:24:54,938
Stand by.

249
00:24:57,816 --> 00:24:59,317
State your purpose.

250
00:24:59,526 --> 00:25:01,069
Mama sent me.

251
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:04,197
The usual spell?

252
00:25:05,657 --> 00:25:07,784
Behave yourself, now.

253
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:26,136
It's not the Wastes.

254
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:29,139
Granny, are you a witch, too?

255
00:25:29,764 --> 00:25:33,894
That's right, I'm the scariest witch in the land.

256
00:25:34,144 --> 00:25:36,980
Sprinkle this powder on your ship and the winds will favor it.

257
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:38,273
Sure.

258
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,193
Many thanks.

259
00:25:44,237 --> 00:25:46,489
I can't have you making up things.

260
00:25:46,698 --> 00:25:48,366
You should give up that disguise.

261
00:25:48,575 --> 00:25:51,536
It's not a disguise, it's magic.

262
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:55,040
The Kingsbury door.

263
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:57,667
Stand by.

264
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:06,051
Is this the residence of Wizard Pendragon?

265
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:07,260
It is, indeed.

266
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:10,597
I bear an invitation from His Majesty.

267
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:15,018
Please inform Master Pendragon that he is required at the Palace.

268
00:26:15,977 --> 00:26:18,063
Our thanks to you.

269
00:26:32,744 --> 00:26:38,166
A city fit for a king Get back in or you'll lose your nose.

270
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:45,548
Stop wandering around!

271
00:27:21,636 --> 00:27:23,159
That's enough!

272
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:24,702
I'm going to get really mad.

273
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:27,757
This is a magic house, isn't it?

274
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:28,758
Oh, boy!

275
00:27:28,977 --> 00:27:30,667
- Where does the black one lead?

276
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:32,377
- Only Master Howl knows.

277
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:35,473
I'm having my breakfast.

278
00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:47,026
But you've got bacon and eggs.

279
00:27:48,027 --> 00:27:51,197
We can't use the fire when Master Howl's away.

280
00:27:54,784 --> 00:27:56,619
I'll cook for you.

281
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:58,163
But you can't.

282
00:27:58,371 --> 00:28:01,583
Calcifer only obeys Master Howl.

283
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,377
That's right, I won't cook for you.

284
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:07,463
Oh, here's my hat.

285
00:28:10,685 --> 00:28:12,042
All right, Calcifer.

286
00:28:12,062 --> 00:28:13,419
Be a good fire, now.

287
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:16,097
Forget it, I'm a demon!

288
00:28:16,306 --> 00:28:18,766
I answer to no one.

289
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,395
You'll do as I say, or I'll pour water on you.

290
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:25,398
Or would you rather I told Howl about our bargain?

291
00:28:26,868 --> 00:28:28,141
Hey!

292
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:29,434
Hey!

293
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:30,727
I never should've let this old lady in.

294
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:32,822
So, what'll it be?

295
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:39,329
That's right, there's a good fire.

296
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:42,447
Hey!

297
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:43,281
Hey!

298
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:44,115
I'll burn the bacon.

299
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,711
Calcifer's doing what she says.

300
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,245
I'd like some tea, too.

301
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:49,580
Have you got a kettle?

302
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:50,882
Sure!

303
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:02,185
Welcome home, Master Howl.

304
00:29:02,393 --> 00:29:04,395
You have letters from the king.

305
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:07,190
To Jenkins and to Pendragon.

306
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:20,787
Calcifer, you're so obedient.

307
00:29:21,287 --> 00:29:22,789
She bullied me.

308
00:29:23,748 --> 00:29:26,167
Not an easy thing to do.

309
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:28,044
Who exactly are you?

310
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:31,214
I'm Grandma Sophie.

311
00:29:31,422 --> 00:29:34,050
You see, I'm your new cleaning lady.

312
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:35,718
Give me that.

313
00:29:39,806 --> 00:29:42,850
Pass me two more bacon slices and six more eggs.

314
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,758
And who hired you to clean?

315
00:30:16,592 --> 00:30:18,219
Why, I hired myself.

316
00:30:18,428 --> 00:30:20,680
I've never seen such a filthy house.

317
00:30:22,765 --> 00:30:24,559
Markl, plates.

318
00:30:28,146 --> 00:30:30,523
You're all ganging up on me!

319
00:30:30,815 --> 00:30:32,400
Please join us, Sophie.

320
00:30:37,947 --> 00:30:39,532
Sit over here.

321
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,256
Pick one.

322
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:57,758
Everything else is dirty.

323
00:31:00,845 --> 00:31:02,763
I've got my work cut out for me.

324
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:06,100
Markl.

325
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:07,268
Yes.

326
00:31:08,895 --> 00:31:09,979
Sophie.

327
00:31:10,188 --> 00:31:11,397
Thank you.

328
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:15,484
Brethren, let us partake of our daily bread.

329
00:31:15,703 --> 00:31:17,414
Our daily bread.

330
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:19,145
Haven't had a real breakfast in a long while.

331
00:31:26,037 --> 00:31:28,915
So many manners to teach...

332
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:32,752
So, what's that in your pocket?

333
00:31:44,513 --> 00:31:45,514
I wonder what it is.

334
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:46,974
Let me.

335
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:54,430
It's scorched into the table!

336
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,806
Master Howl, this is...

337
00:31:56,901 --> 00:31:58,402
Ancient sorcery.

338
00:31:58,611 --> 00:31:59,820
And powerful, too.

339
00:32:00,363 --> 00:32:01,656
The Witch of the Waste?

340
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:06,494
"He who catches a falling star, oh heartless man.

341
00:32:06,702 --> 00:32:08,913
Your heart shall be mine."

342
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:17,619
Well, so much for the tab.

343
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:26,127
Le Wow, it's gone!

344
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:28,683
The scorch mark has vanished, but not the spell.

345
00:32:29,392 --> 00:32:31,978
Brethren, continue your meal.

346
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,273
Calcifer, move the castle 100 kilometers.

347
00:32:41,831 --> 00:32:43,354
- And send hot water to the bath.

348
00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:44,897
- Not that, too!

349
00:32:47,493 --> 00:32:49,870
Do you work for the Witch of the Waste?

350
00:32:51,215 --> 00:32:53,218
Don't be stupid!

351
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,241
The witch...

352
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:00,141
Actually... the witch...

353
00:33:00,161 --> 00:33:01,579
I...

354
00:33:06,772 --> 00:33:08,254
Damn that Witch of the Waste!

355
00:33:08,274 --> 00:33:09,756
Wait 'til I get my hands on her!

356
00:33:09,974 --> 00:33:11,976
Let me finish eating this.

357
00:33:16,147 --> 00:33:19,567
Bugs, you'd better scurry away or I'll sweep you out!

358
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:24,113
Every last one of you, mocking me!

359
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:33,122
There's a spell I need.

360
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,290
Later.

361
00:33:34,498 --> 00:33:36,542
A witch rages within.

362
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:44,633
Sophie!

363
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:48,169
Sophie!

364
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:49,671
I'm going out.

365
00:33:50,681 --> 00:33:52,933
I'll die without some fresh wood!

366
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:55,394
What, what are you doing?

367
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:57,365
I'll fall, I'll fall!

368
00:33:57,385 --> 00:33:58,971
I'm in peril!

369
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,317
I'm sweeping the ashes.

370
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:02,401
Won't be a minute.

371
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,487
I'm in danger!

372
00:34:04,695 --> 00:34:06,238
I'm in danger...

373
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:08,824
I'll go out!

374
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:10,409
Oh, no!

375
00:34:13,496 --> 00:34:16,332
I'm slipping...

376
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:24,632
Hurry, Sophie!

377
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:49,907
Try not to torment my friend.

378
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:57,456
Master Howl, are you going out?

379
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:04,338
Markl, tell our cleaning lady not to get too carried away.

380
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:11,011
What'd you do, Sophie?

381
00:35:12,054 --> 00:35:13,514
She abused me!

382
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:16,892
If I die, Howl goes with me.

383
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:18,519
I'm the cleaning lady.

384
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:20,896
It's my job to clean.

385
00:35:22,356 --> 00:35:24,817
No, not the 2nd floor!

386
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:28,320
If I were you, I'd put your precious things away in a hurry.

387
00:35:29,613 --> 00:35:31,407
Save my room for later.

388
00:35:34,618 --> 00:35:37,705
My little outburst gave me back my strength.

389
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,669
What a strange house!

390
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,790
Amazing!

391
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:24,084
Calcifer, Calcifer!

392
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:26,378
Are you moving the castle?

393
00:36:26,597 --> 00:36:27,828
What a lot of fuss!

394
00:36:27,848 --> 00:36:29,079
Of course I am.

395
00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:30,591
You're incredible, Calcifer!

396
00:36:31,185 --> 00:36:32,687
Your magic's first class.

397
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:34,209
I misjudged you completely!

398
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:38,348
You think so?

399
00:36:38,557 --> 00:36:40,476
You really think so!

400
00:36:46,982 --> 00:36:49,151
Oh, no, not yet!

401
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:22,684
How beautiful.

402
00:37:22,893 --> 00:37:24,978
It's called Star Lake.

403
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:31,860
Something's stuck in there.

404
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,226
Oh, dear.

405
00:37:33,246 --> 00:37:34,393
Lend me a hand, Markl.

406
00:37:34,613 --> 00:37:35,656
Sure.

407
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:42,955
And up!

408
00:37:43,163 --> 00:37:44,623
A scarecrow!

409
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:46,667
He's called Turnip, the Turnip-head.

410
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:49,670
You sure like being upside down.

411
00:37:58,762 --> 00:38:01,056
The odd creature seems to have taken a liking to me.

412
00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:03,058
He followed me here.

413
00:38:03,267 --> 00:38:05,477
Are you sure you're not a witch, Sophie?

414
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:09,147
That's right, I'm the cleanest witch in the land.

415
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,263
Turnip, don't pull it so tight.

416
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,983
Seems like he likes doing the wash.

417
00:38:53,191 --> 00:38:55,444
They'll dry in no time.

418
00:38:57,946 --> 00:39:00,240
Turnip must belong to the demons.

419
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:01,992
Calcifer doesn't seem to mind him.

420
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,120
You're right, maybe he's a demon of the dead.

421
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:09,916
But he led me to this wonderful place.

422
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:55,045
I've put away all the laundry, Sophie.

423
00:39:55,305 --> 00:39:56,974
Why, thank you.

424
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,663
We'd better be getting back.

425
00:39:58,882 --> 00:40:04,179
How mysterious, I've never felt such peace.

426
00:41:23,008 --> 00:41:24,134
Stinks!

427
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:26,970
You reek of burnt flesh and steel.

428
00:41:46,781 --> 00:41:49,743
Keep flying and one day you won't be able to change yourself back.

429
00:41:54,382 --> 00:41:55,592
Isn't it great!

430
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:56,822
Sophie did this for me.

431
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,880
The fighting is fierce.

432
00:42:02,088 --> 00:42:05,633
The country's ablaze, from the southern coast to the northern border.

433
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:08,386
I hate the fire in gunpowder.

434
00:42:08,605 --> 00:42:12,005
They have no manners - My own kind attacked me.

435
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:15,425
- The Witch of the Waste?

436
00:42:15,643 --> 00:42:18,980
Hack wizards masquerading as monsters.

437
00:42:19,689 --> 00:42:24,819
They'll cry plenty later on, when they can't regain human form.

438
00:42:25,445 --> 00:42:28,448
No, they'll just forget they ever knew how to cry.

439
00:42:28,656 --> 00:42:31,242
Aren't you supposed to report to the king yourself?

440
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:32,702
Yes, well...

441
00:42:32,911 --> 00:42:36,331
Hot water for my bath Oh, no, not again.

442
00:43:09,405 --> 00:43:10,615
Is that Howl?

443
00:43:10,824 --> 00:43:12,951
Yeah, wasting my hot water again.

444
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:21,209
I'm sure Howl won't eat any breakfast.

445
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:22,293
No matter.

446
00:43:22,502 --> 00:43:24,045
Morning.

447
00:43:27,173 --> 00:43:29,133
It's lovely shopping in the morning.

448
00:43:29,342 --> 00:43:31,094
I've never seen the ocean!

449
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:33,805
Such beautiful, sparkling water!

450
00:43:34,013 --> 00:43:35,932
Same as it always is.

451
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:47,110
I myself hate potatoes.

452
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:48,486
Pay up.

453
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:49,988
Thank you.

454
00:43:50,321 --> 00:43:51,114
Thanks.

455
00:43:53,074 --> 00:43:55,493
Fish, all fresh off the boat.

456
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,652
- That one's tasty.

457
00:43:57,672 --> 00:43:59,404
- I myself hate fish.

458
00:43:59,706 --> 00:44:01,791
The fleet's come home!

459
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,387
- Is that the smoke?

460
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,784
- There's been another battle.

461
00:44:05,054 --> 00:44:05,973
Really?

462
00:44:05,993 --> 00:44:06,912
Sorry, lady, later.

463
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:08,673
That ship's on fire!

464
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:33,948
Sophie, let's go get a closer look.

465
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,690
No, I've no stomach for such things.

466
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,233
Let's go home.

467
00:44:38,077 --> 00:44:40,538
Our most advanced battleship, reduced to this.

468
00:44:45,376 --> 00:44:47,462
Markl, there are Blob Men nearby.

469
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:49,213
Don't move.

470
00:44:49,464 --> 00:44:51,549
They work for the Witch of the Waste.

471
00:44:57,555 --> 00:44:58,598
They're gone.

472
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:01,017
Don't people notice those terrible monsters?

473
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:07,784
Look!

474
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:08,639
Up there!

475
00:45:08,983 --> 00:45:10,735
That's what dropped those bombs!

476
00:45:10,943 --> 00:45:12,695
An enemy airship, Sophie!

477
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:20,495
Sophie, flyers!

478
00:45:20,963 --> 00:45:22,382
Ignore the flyers!

479
00:45:22,402 --> 00:45:23,821
They're enemy propaganda!

480
00:45:28,795 --> 00:45:30,046
Are you OK, Sophie?

481
00:45:36,677 --> 00:45:39,555
A glass of water, please Sure.

482
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,855
Sophie, what did you do to the bathroom shelves?

483
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,190
Look!

484
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,285
My hair's turned this weird color!

485
00:46:01,494 --> 00:46:03,204
What... what beautiful hair.

486
00:46:03,412 --> 00:46:04,413
Take a good look!

487
00:46:04,997 --> 00:46:08,042
You mixed up everything on the shelves and ruined the spells!

488
00:46:09,418 --> 00:46:11,796
I didn't mix up anything, I simply cleaned up.

489
00:46:12,296 --> 00:46:13,798
Cleaning, always cleaning.

490
00:46:14,006 --> 00:46:17,510
I told you not to get too carried away!

491
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,011
It's hopeless!

492
00:46:20,138 --> 00:46:22,682
How humiliating.

493
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:25,935
It's not so very bad.

494
00:46:34,193 --> 00:46:36,737
This new shade's quite lovely in its way.

495
00:46:37,446 --> 00:46:38,364
I'm done for.

496
00:46:38,573 --> 00:46:41,742
What's the point in living, if you aren't beautiful?

497
00:46:53,598 --> 00:46:54,850
Stop, Howl!

498
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,122
Cut it out!

499
00:46:56,716 --> 00:46:58,551
He's calling on the spirits of Darkness.

500
00:46:58,759 --> 00:47:01,679
He did this last time a girl ditched him.

501
00:47:05,057 --> 00:47:07,101
Please, Howl, that's enough.

502
00:47:07,894 --> 00:47:11,022
You can just dye your hair again.

503
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:23,993
I've had enough of you, Howl!

504
00:47:24,201 --> 00:47:27,038
I've never once been beautiful!

505
00:47:28,914 --> 00:47:30,625
I've had enough of this place!

506
00:48:10,341 --> 00:48:13,533
Thank you, Turnip You're a kind scarecrow Please come back, Sophie.

507
00:48:13,553 --> 00:48:16,745
Howl's in trouble!

508
00:48:17,348 --> 00:48:18,830
Cut it out, Howl!

509
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:20,332
I'm going out!

510
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,760
Sophie!

511
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:25,221
Get over here!

512
00:48:27,598 --> 00:48:28,724
My, he's dramatic.

513
00:48:28,933 --> 00:48:30,017
Is he dead?

514
00:48:30,236 --> 00:48:31,718
Don't worry.

515
00:48:31,738 --> 00:48:33,220
A tantrum never killed anyone.

516
00:48:33,437 --> 00:48:35,064
Help me, Markl.

517
00:48:39,443 --> 00:48:41,570
Get that hot water running, Markl!

518
00:48:42,029 --> 00:48:44,698
C'mon, you can still walk.

519
00:48:56,168 --> 00:48:58,045
You look after him now, Markl.

520
00:48:58,254 --> 00:48:59,296
Sure.

521
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:02,800
I'll have to clean all over again.

522
00:49:26,115 --> 00:49:27,658
I'm coming in.

523
00:49:35,843 --> 00:49:37,220
Here's some hot milk.

524
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,617
Drink up.

525
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:43,727
I'll leave it here.

526
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,583
Drink it while it's hot.

527
00:49:49,346 --> 00:49:51,098
Don't leave me, Sophie.

528
00:49:59,231 --> 00:50:00,774
Try a little milk?

529
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,954
The Witch of the Waste is searching for my house.

530
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:18,709
You're right, I saw her cronies down at the port.

531
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:21,962
The truth is, I'm a coward.

532
00:50:22,171 --> 00:50:25,674
All this junk is just sorcery to keep her away.

533
00:50:25,883 --> 00:50:27,468
I'm scared to death.

534
00:50:29,261 --> 00:50:32,473
Tell me, why is the Witch of the Waste after you?

535
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:37,353
She seemed quite interesting, so I approached her.

536
00:50:37,561 --> 00:50:40,981
But she terrified me and I ran away.

537
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:47,196
Now the king's ordered me to report to him.

538
00:50:47,404 --> 00:50:49,782
As Jenkins and as Pendragon...

539
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:52,409
How many names do you use, Howl?

540
00:50:52,618 --> 00:50:54,912
Enough to guarantee my freedom.

541
00:50:56,288 --> 00:50:58,499
Can't you refuse the king?

542
00:50:58,707 --> 00:50:59,833
See that...

543
00:51:00,584 --> 00:51:04,546
The oath I took at the Sorcery Academy.

544
00:51:06,975 --> 00:51:08,185
Say, Howl.

545
00:51:08,205 --> 00:51:09,415
Why not visit the king?

546
00:51:09,927 --> 00:51:11,136
What!

547
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:13,430
Just say it to his face.

548
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:17,267
"Stop this foolish war I refuse to help you."

549
00:51:19,812 --> 00:51:22,189
Sophie, you don't know what they're like.

550
00:51:22,981 --> 00:51:23,941
But he's the king, right?

551
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:27,361
A king thinks only of what's best for his people.

552
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:29,696
I know!

553
00:51:29,988 --> 00:51:32,116
You'll go in my place, Sophie!

554
00:51:34,201 --> 00:51:36,703
Pretend you're Pendragon's mother.

555
00:51:36,954 --> 00:51:40,124
Just tell him your son is an idle good-for-nothing.

556
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:43,127
Maybe Madam Suliman will even give up on me.

557
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,504
Madam Suliman?

558
00:51:48,924 --> 00:51:50,634
You're wearing that hat?

559
00:51:50,926 --> 00:51:53,137
After all the magic I spent making your dress pretty...

560
00:51:53,345 --> 00:51:54,304
Off I go.

561
00:51:54,513 --> 00:51:55,556
Sure!

562
00:51:55,889 --> 00:51:57,724
See you later!

563
00:52:05,941 --> 00:52:08,318
This charm assures your safe return.

564
00:52:10,404 --> 00:52:13,240
Don't worry, I'll follow you in disguise.

565
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:14,314
There.

566
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:14,981
Off you go!

567
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:25,836
I'm sure this will never work.

568
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,015
I don't suppose he's following me, disguised as a crow.

569
00:52:45,063 --> 00:52:54,865
I'm sure Howl would pick a more dramatic disguise Not that...

570
00:53:06,668 --> 00:53:09,254
The Palace is so far away.

571
00:53:51,139 --> 00:53:52,600
Howl?

572
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,081
Don't tell me you're Howl.

573
00:54:00,138 --> 00:54:02,933
Disguising yourself as an old dog, of all things.

574
00:54:03,141 --> 00:54:05,268
Do you know how exhausting it is to be old?

575
00:54:08,657 --> 00:54:10,159
How nice to see you.

576
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:11,681
The little hatter, right?

577
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:13,652
The Witch of the Waste!

578
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,780
Thank you so much for delivering my note to Howl.

579
00:54:19,449 --> 00:54:21,284
How's Howl doing?

580
00:54:21,743 --> 00:54:23,453
Quite terrified.

581
00:54:23,662 --> 00:54:26,748
Thanks to him, I've become a cleaning lady.

582
00:54:27,874 --> 00:54:29,626
My, how delightful.

583
00:54:30,669 --> 00:54:33,880
By the way, what brings you to see the king?

584
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:35,768
Job hunting.

585
00:54:35,788 --> 00:54:37,457
I'm sick of working for Howl.

586
00:54:37,676 --> 00:54:38,635
And yourself?

587
00:54:39,344 --> 00:54:41,930
The king invited me.

588
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:46,643
It seems that idiot, Suliman, finally needs my power.

589
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,272
Why don't you break the spell you put on me?

590
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,232
That's impossible.

591
00:54:52,441 --> 00:54:56,486
My gifts lie in casting spells, not breaking them.

592
00:54:56,695 --> 00:54:58,947
See you later, then.

593
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:01,127
Hey, wait a minute!

594
00:55:01,147 --> 00:55:02,816
Just wait!

595
00:55:04,161 --> 00:55:06,663
If you weren't here, I'd have hit her with my cane.

596
00:55:24,723 --> 00:55:26,016
What's wrong with you?

597
00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:29,728
Madam, vehicles are prohibited beyond this point.

598
00:55:29,936 --> 00:55:31,354
Please continue on foot.

599
00:55:31,938 --> 00:55:33,356
That Suliman!

600
00:55:33,565 --> 00:55:37,402
Using magic to force me to climb these stairs.

601
00:55:48,423 --> 00:55:49,591
We'll catch up.

602
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:50,779
Pay her no mind.

603
00:56:16,024 --> 00:56:18,944
Heavy, why are you so heavy?

604
00:56:28,964 --> 00:56:30,209
You...

605
00:56:30,229 --> 00:56:31,474
Hey...

606
00:56:31,494 --> 00:56:32,739
Wait.

607
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:34,501
What is it?

608
00:56:34,709 --> 00:56:38,797
Suddenly remembered... how to break my spell?

609
00:56:39,005 --> 00:56:42,592
I told you...

610
00:56:42,926 --> 00:56:43,760
I don't know how.

611
00:56:44,135 --> 00:56:45,929
Then, start studying up.

612
00:56:50,725 --> 00:56:52,769
I don't get it.

613
00:56:52,978 --> 00:56:56,106
Where does she get all that energy?

614
00:57:04,406 --> 00:57:06,199
I have to put you down.

615
00:57:12,674 --> 00:57:14,468
Why don't you call it a day?

616
00:57:14,488 --> 00:57:16,282
You can't make it.

617
00:57:17,043 --> 00:57:21,840
It's been 50 years now, since they drove me out of here...

618
00:57:22,215 --> 00:57:26,970
I've been longing for this day, ever since...

619
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,888
Good luck to you, then.

620
00:57:29,097 --> 00:57:32,225
Still, I'm not nice enough to help you out.

621
00:57:32,892 --> 00:57:34,394
Come, Howl.

622
00:57:35,687 --> 00:57:37,605
You heartless wench!

623
00:57:37,814 --> 00:57:40,316
Next time I'll turn you feeble, too!

624
00:58:01,379 --> 00:58:03,381
Hurry up!

625
00:58:04,299 --> 00:58:06,426
Madam, follow me.

626
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,763
First, you should help her.

627
00:58:09,971 --> 00:58:12,849
We are forbidden to assist anyone.

628
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:16,186
But the king himself invited her.

629
00:58:16,394 --> 00:58:18,646
Hang in there!

630
00:58:19,564 --> 00:58:21,232
Just a little farther!

631
00:58:22,192 --> 00:58:24,486
And you call yourself a witch?

632
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,530
Who asked you?

633
00:58:30,241 --> 00:58:32,076
You suddenly look older.

634
00:58:33,203 --> 00:58:36,372
Madam Pendragon and the Witch of the Waste!

635
00:58:37,957 --> 00:58:39,459
Pull yourself together.

636
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:41,961
Isn't this what you've been waiting for?

637
00:58:45,215 --> 00:58:48,468
Madam Pendragon and the Witch of the Waste!

638
00:58:48,686 --> 00:58:50,689
Pendragon...

639
00:58:50,709 --> 00:58:52,712
That name sounds familiar.

640
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:54,651
Of course it does.

641
00:58:54,671 --> 00:58:56,381
That was the name of my hat shop.

642
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:57,602
It was?

643
00:58:58,228 --> 00:58:59,979
Please wait here.

644
00:59:06,486 --> 00:59:07,570
A chair!

645
00:59:07,946 --> 00:59:09,739
It's mine!

646
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:23,419
Howl, get back here!

647
00:59:31,636 --> 00:59:33,179
Madam, this way please.

648
01:00:33,614 --> 01:00:35,616
I understand you're Howl's mother.

649
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:37,650
Yes.

650
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:38,609
My name is Pendragon.

651
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,486
I'm sure you're weary.

652
01:00:40,506 --> 01:00:41,612
Please have a seat.

653
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:43,332
Yes.

654
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:56,637
I am Madam Suliman, His Majesty's witch.

655
01:01:02,894 --> 01:01:04,145
Um, that dog is...

656
01:01:04,937 --> 01:01:06,397
Ah, you mean Heen?

657
01:01:06,616 --> 01:01:08,285
He does my errands.

658
01:01:08,305 --> 01:01:09,974
I asked him to escort you.

659
01:01:14,363 --> 01:01:16,491
Howl won't join us, then?

660
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:21,120
You see, he sends his mother to make excuses.

661
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:23,998
I'm sure he'd be utterly useless to His Majesty.

662
01:01:25,374 --> 01:01:27,835
What a shame.

663
01:01:28,044 --> 01:01:31,172
He was my last apprentice...

664
01:01:32,215 --> 01:01:35,343
A student of such marvelous gifts.

665
01:01:35,593 --> 01:01:39,472
I rejoiced in finally finding a worthy heir.

666
01:01:41,807 --> 01:01:47,355
But then, a demon stole his heart, and he abandoned me.

667
01:01:47,563 --> 01:01:51,692
He turned his magic to purely selfish uses.

668
01:01:53,955 --> 01:01:54,602
Mrs.

669
01:01:54,622 --> 01:01:55,269
Pendragon.

670
01:01:55,738 --> 01:01:57,532
That boy is dangerous.

671
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:01,869
His power is too great for one with no heart.

672
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,041
If he follows that path he'll wind up like the Witch of the Waste.

673
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,042
Bring her!

674
01:02:14,757 --> 01:02:16,259
What happened?

675
01:02:18,511 --> 01:02:21,430
I just restored her to her real age.

676
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:23,182
All her powers are gone.

677
01:02:23,849 --> 01:02:27,728
Once upon a time, she was a magnificent witch.

678
01:02:28,354 --> 01:02:31,023
She made a bargain with a demon.

679
01:02:31,232 --> 01:02:34,318
Who consumed her, body and soul, long, long ago.

680
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:40,449
Our kingdom can no longer afford to turn a blind eye to disreputable wizards and witches.

681
01:02:40,658 --> 01:02:46,956
If Howl comes here to serve the kingdom, I will teach him how to break with the demon.

682
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:51,252
If not, I'll strip him of his powers as I have taken hers.

683
01:02:52,545 --> 01:02:53,421
Now just a minute.

684
01:02:55,214 --> 01:02:58,092
Now I understand why Howl refused to come here.

685
01:02:58,759 --> 01:03:00,136
Something's not right.

686
01:03:00,354 --> 01:03:03,129
Forcing your aged guests to climb stairs, dragging them into strange rooms...

687
01:03:03,149 --> 01:03:05,924
It's like a trap.

688
01:03:06,475 --> 01:03:08,311
You call Howl heartless!

689
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:12,273
Yes, he's selfish and cowardly and unpredictable.

690
01:03:12,491 --> 01:03:14,223
But he's straight as an arrow.

691
01:03:14,243 --> 01:03:15,975
He only wants to be free.

692
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:19,280
Howl won't turn into an evil monster.

693
01:03:19,488 --> 01:03:22,116
He'll battle the demon on his own.

694
01:03:22,324 --> 01:03:23,993
I believe in him.

695
01:03:24,754 --> 01:03:25,582
Mrs.

696
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:26,430
Pendragon...

697
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:27,278
You're in love with Howl.

698
01:03:28,299 --> 01:03:29,718
Howl...

699
01:03:29,738 --> 01:03:31,157
Howl's coming?

700
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:34,628
I want Howl's heart, I want it!

701
01:03:34,847 --> 01:03:36,558
That's enough from you.

702
01:03:36,578 --> 01:03:38,289
Howl's not coming.

703
01:03:40,051 --> 01:03:42,011
Howl will most certainly come.

704
01:03:43,054 --> 01:03:45,556
Now, I've found his weakness.

705
01:03:52,354 --> 01:03:53,314
Your Majesty.

706
01:03:53,522 --> 01:03:55,066
As you are.

707
01:03:55,274 --> 01:03:56,650
How are you feeling?

708
01:03:56,869 --> 01:03:59,185
Thank you for asking Meetings bore me.

709
01:03:59,205 --> 01:04:01,521
I flew out for a breather.

710
01:04:02,281 --> 01:04:03,491
How lovely.

711
01:04:03,699 --> 01:04:05,201
These are...?

712
01:04:05,576 --> 01:04:07,828
This is Wizard Howl's mother.

713
01:04:08,037 --> 01:04:09,330
I see.

714
01:04:13,334 --> 01:04:17,671
I appreciate it, but I don't intend to win any war with magic.

715
01:04:18,547 --> 01:04:21,300
It's true that Suliman's powers shield our palace from bombs.

716
01:04:21,509 --> 01:04:22,927
But they just fall on neighboring towns.

717
01:04:23,145 --> 01:04:24,377
That's how magic works.

718
01:04:24,397 --> 01:04:25,629
Right, Suliman?

719
01:04:25,846 --> 01:04:28,307
Such eloquence today, Your Majesty.

720
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:30,518
Suliman!

721
01:04:30,903 --> 01:04:31,550
This is the final battle.

722
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:32,217
This time, we'll beat them to a pulp.

723
01:04:35,407 --> 01:04:37,306
Suliman, you've outdone yourself with that double.

724
01:04:37,326 --> 01:04:39,225
Await good news.

725
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:46,367
Thank you kindly.

726
01:04:46,575 --> 01:04:47,701
Have my generals assembled?

727
01:04:48,577 --> 01:04:50,329
It's been awhile, Howl.

728
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:57,169
Delighted to see you doing so well.

729
01:04:57,378 --> 01:04:59,380
I saw right through you.

730
01:04:59,588 --> 01:05:01,674
Not a very clever disguise.

731
01:05:01,882 --> 01:05:03,634
I've kept my oath.

732
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:06,303
I've no wish to fight you.

733
01:05:06,762 --> 01:05:08,097
I'll take my mother.

734
01:05:08,389 --> 01:05:10,057
I won't let you go.

735
01:05:31,704 --> 01:05:33,664
Don't look down, you'll be dragged down.

736
01:05:34,415 --> 01:05:38,210
It's time I showed your mother what you really are.

737
01:06:32,608 --> 01:06:33,380
Howl, don't!

738
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,172
It's a trap!

739
01:06:47,529 --> 01:06:48,614
Hold tight!

740
01:06:56,497 --> 01:06:58,123
Sophie, sit up front.

741
01:06:59,917 --> 01:07:03,796
Oh, no, Sophie, you brought the whole gang along.

742
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:06,381
Nice doggie.

743
01:07:07,049 --> 01:07:10,094
You're just Suliman's spy.

744
01:07:10,302 --> 01:07:12,930
Oh, well, too late to toss you now.

745
01:07:13,138 --> 01:07:14,515
Sophie, you steer.

746
01:07:14,733 --> 01:07:15,902
What!

747
01:07:15,922 --> 01:07:17,091
I can't possibly!

748
01:07:17,309 --> 01:07:18,685
They're after us.

749
01:07:23,826 --> 01:07:25,411
I'll tackle them.

750
01:07:25,431 --> 01:07:27,016
Fly straight to the castle in the Wastes.

751
01:07:27,246 --> 01:07:28,101
What!

752
01:07:28,121 --> 01:07:28,976
That's impossible!

753
01:07:29,196 --> 01:07:32,157
Don't worry, the ring will guide you.

754
01:07:32,366 --> 01:07:34,535
Summon Calcifer with your heart.

755
01:07:34,743 --> 01:07:36,203
Summon Calcifer?

756
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:40,666
It's glowing!

757
01:07:42,135 --> 01:07:43,575
Follow the light.

758
01:07:43,595 --> 01:07:45,035
You'll be there by nightfall.

759
01:07:45,254 --> 01:07:48,674
Why send me to Suliman if you were coming yourself?

760
01:07:48,882 --> 01:07:51,343
Your presence gave me the courage for it.

761
01:07:51,552 --> 01:07:53,720
She's too terrible to face on my own.

762
01:07:54,481 --> 01:07:56,421
You've saved me.

763
01:07:56,441 --> 01:07:58,381
I was in grave danger back there.

764
01:08:00,435 --> 01:08:01,895
Don't let go!

765
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:10,153
- You're good - Stop joking!

766
01:08:12,781 --> 01:08:14,408
We've got a lead now.

767
01:08:14,825 --> 01:08:17,494
I can give you 5 minutes of invisibility, now's your chance.

768
01:08:21,206 --> 01:08:22,499
Howl!

769
01:08:34,803 --> 01:08:36,638
No, thank you.

770
01:08:37,149 --> 01:08:38,818
Thank you.

771
01:08:38,838 --> 01:08:40,507
That's the most fun I've had in ages.

772
01:08:41,101 --> 01:08:44,021
I supposed Howl thinks he's escaped...

773
01:08:44,438 --> 01:08:47,065
His mother's awfully young.

774
01:09:38,043 --> 01:09:39,086
We're not far.

775
01:09:39,106 --> 01:09:40,149
That's my hometown.

776
01:09:44,007 --> 01:09:45,489
Don't look so friendly.

777
01:09:45,509 --> 01:09:46,991
I don't trust you.

778
01:10:11,201 --> 01:10:12,098
The castle.

779
01:10:12,118 --> 01:10:13,015
They've come to meet us!

780
01:10:17,906 --> 01:10:20,033
Sophie!

781
01:10:20,492 --> 01:10:22,035
Markl, help!

782
01:10:22,244 --> 01:10:24,037
I don't know how to stop this thing!

783
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:37,926
Sophie!

784
01:10:38,927 --> 01:10:40,387
Doggie.

785
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:43,348
Markl!

786
01:10:44,432 --> 01:10:45,600
I'm home.

787
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:47,936
Sophie, are you hurt?

788
01:10:49,104 --> 01:10:50,147
You're home!

789
01:10:50,355 --> 01:10:53,066
Thank you for coming to meet us.

790
01:11:24,014 --> 01:11:26,141
Oh, no, you've gone too far.

791
01:11:44,951 --> 01:11:46,911
I wonder if Howl's back.

792
01:12:41,466 --> 01:12:42,592
Howl?

793
01:13:45,206 --> 01:13:45,957
Howl?

794
01:13:45,977 --> 01:13:46,728
Is it you?

795
01:13:50,336 --> 01:13:51,213
Are you hurt?

796
01:13:51,233 --> 01:13:52,110
In pain?

797
01:13:53,371 --> 01:13:55,123
Stay away.

798
01:13:55,456 --> 01:13:57,417
I want to help you.

799
01:13:57,625 --> 01:13:59,460
I want to break the spell you're under.

800
01:14:00,753 --> 01:14:03,965
You can't even break your own spell!

801
01:14:04,424 --> 01:14:06,467
But I love you!

802
01:14:06,926 --> 01:14:08,720
Too late.

803
01:14:12,932 --> 01:14:14,183
Howl!

804
01:14:27,405 --> 01:14:28,948
Howl must be back.

805
01:14:29,157 --> 01:14:33,494
Sophie, you'd better figure out how to break my spell quick.

806
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,080
We're both running out of time.

807
01:14:36,466 --> 01:14:37,759
Meaning Howl will turn into a monster?

808
01:14:37,779 --> 01:14:39,072
Is it true?

809
01:14:39,292 --> 01:14:41,377
I can't tell you that.

810
01:14:41,586 --> 01:14:42,712
I'm a demon.

811
01:14:44,672 --> 01:14:49,969
Calcifer, Suliman told me, Howl has given you something very precious.

812
01:14:50,188 --> 01:14:51,127
What is it?

813
01:14:51,147 --> 01:14:52,086
Where is it?

814
01:14:52,305 --> 01:14:54,933
That's confidential information.

815
01:14:55,141 --> 01:14:57,602
And if I threaten to dump water over you?

816
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:59,072
How dare you!

817
01:14:59,092 --> 01:15:00,344
Howl will die with me!

818
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:21,834
Good morning, Turnip.

819
01:15:22,043 --> 01:15:23,961
We've got to be brave.

820
01:15:27,298 --> 01:15:29,300
Ready, Sophie!

821
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,146
Ok!

822
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:32,752
Open wider, Calcifer!

823
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,442
Here goes!

824
01:15:35,462 --> 01:15:36,964
Push!

825
01:15:37,183 --> 01:15:38,726
Heave!

826
01:15:46,734 --> 01:15:51,406
I... said... move!

827
01:15:51,656 --> 01:15:52,990
Come on!

828
01:16:14,846 --> 01:16:18,683
They call it a castle, but once you get inside, it's a junk heap.

829
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:23,229
It's time to eat!

830
01:16:29,735 --> 01:16:31,279
Here, old girl.

831
01:16:32,155 --> 01:16:35,241
But, Sophie she's the Witch of the Waste.

832
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:36,993
No need to worry.

833
01:16:37,201 --> 01:16:39,203
Why's she staring at me?

834
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:41,747
Such a pretty fire.

835
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:45,543
Howl!

836
01:16:45,751 --> 01:16:46,878
Hello, everyone.

837
01:16:47,096 --> 01:16:48,620
- Welcome home.

838
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,164
- Master Howl, can we keep this puppy?

839
01:16:50,923 --> 01:16:53,801
An old Witch and Madam Suliman's dog.

840
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:56,179
Why'd you let them in, Calcifer?

841
01:16:56,929 --> 01:16:57,805
Don't look at me!

842
01:16:58,014 --> 01:17:00,433
They blew in with Sophie.

843
01:17:03,436 --> 01:17:05,188
Sophie, always dramatic...

844
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:08,107
So you're Turnip.

845
01:17:10,526 --> 01:17:12,612
You're under quite a spell, too.

846
01:17:13,571 --> 01:17:15,865
Seems everyone in our little family is complicated...

847
01:17:16,073 --> 01:17:18,075
He's so handsome.

848
01:17:18,794 --> 01:17:20,234
This is a busy day.

849
01:17:20,254 --> 01:17:21,694
We're moving.

850
01:17:22,121 --> 01:17:22,997
Moving?

851
01:17:23,216 --> 01:17:24,698
Oh, good.

852
01:17:24,718 --> 01:17:26,200
There aren't any shops, here in the middle of nowhere.

853
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:30,129
Madam Suliman can track us down in no time, here.

854
01:17:30,514 --> 01:17:32,476
But you'll have to stay behind.

855
01:17:32,496 --> 01:17:34,458
The magic in your spell's too risky.

856
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,141
All right, that's done.

857
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:45,019
Take it away, Calcifer.

858
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:01,619
Excellent.

859
01:18:01,827 --> 01:18:03,287
Stay right where you are.

860
01:18:06,832 --> 01:18:08,709
Be gentle...

861
01:18:12,213 --> 01:18:13,297
Here goes.

862
01:18:57,893 --> 01:18:59,228
We've moved.

863
01:18:59,248 --> 01:19:00,583
You can get up now.

864
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:03,962
Amazing, Master!

865
01:19:03,982 --> 01:19:05,004
It's so grand!

866
01:19:05,766 --> 01:19:08,394
What a pretty fire.

867
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:23,868
This is...

868
01:19:24,086 --> 01:19:25,776
I added a bathroom.

869
01:19:25,796 --> 01:19:27,486
For our growing family.

870
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,551
Sophie, come here!

871
01:19:29,571 --> 01:19:31,282
Sophie!

872
01:19:34,221 --> 01:19:35,640
I added a bedroom, too.

873
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:37,079
Go in.

874
01:19:47,725 --> 01:19:49,310
This is... why?

875
01:19:49,737 --> 01:19:51,219
I thought it would suit you.

876
01:19:51,239 --> 01:19:52,721
Do you like it?

877
01:19:54,315 --> 01:19:57,568
Yes, it's perfect for a housekeeper.

878
01:19:57,786 --> 01:19:58,712
I got you new clothes, too.

879
01:19:58,732 --> 01:19:59,658
Open them later.

880
01:19:59,678 --> 01:20:00,604
Next.

881
01:20:01,624 --> 01:20:02,466
Sophie!

882
01:20:02,486 --> 01:20:03,328
Come here!

883
01:20:03,348 --> 01:20:04,190
Quick!

884
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:06,577
A courtyard!

885
01:20:06,785 --> 01:20:08,204
There's a shop, too.

886
01:20:08,954 --> 01:20:10,539
Let's go, Heen!

887
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,844
See that new color on the dial?

888
01:20:12,864 --> 01:20:14,408
There's a new exit.

889
01:20:17,806 --> 01:20:19,121
My gift to you, Sophie.

890
01:20:19,141 --> 01:20:20,456
Step outside.

891
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:47,785
It's my secret garden.

892
01:20:48,494 --> 01:20:49,995
Beautiful.

893
01:20:52,373 --> 01:20:54,625
Did you make it with your magic?

894
01:20:55,042 --> 01:20:57,795
Only a little, to help the flowers.

895
01:21:07,012 --> 01:21:09,473
Thank you, Howl!

896
01:21:09,682 --> 01:21:11,016
It's like I'm dreaming.

897
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:35,290
Sophie.

898
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,951
How mysterious.

899
01:21:38,971 --> 01:21:41,203
I feel I've been here before.

900
01:21:41,422 --> 01:21:43,298
I could cry with happiness.

901
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:44,717
Come.

902
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:54,184
Look.

903
01:21:59,732 --> 01:22:01,108
A sweet little house!

904
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:03,110
My favorite hideaway.

905
01:22:03,902 --> 01:22:07,489
When I was little I spent my summers there alone.

906
01:22:09,032 --> 01:22:10,367
Alone?

907
01:22:11,076 --> 01:22:14,705
My Uncle, the Wizard, left it to me in secret.

908
01:22:15,122 --> 01:22:17,583
Make yourself at home there, Sophie.

909
01:22:21,545 --> 01:22:22,379
What's wrong?

910
01:22:23,213 --> 01:22:24,214
I'm scared.

911
01:22:24,423 --> 01:22:27,259
I'm afraid you'll go off and disappear somewhere, once I'm inside.

912
01:22:30,095 --> 01:22:32,306
Howl, tell me the truth.

913
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:35,267
I don't mind if you're a monster.

914
01:22:41,064 --> 01:22:44,526
I want to make sure that you'll all live comfortably.

915
01:22:44,943 --> 01:22:49,031
Why not a flower shop, with all these flowers?

916
01:22:49,448 --> 01:22:51,742
You'd be good at it, Sophie.

917
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:54,077
And then, you'd go away?

918
01:22:55,996 --> 01:22:58,916
I want to help you, Howl.

919
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:03,045
I'm not beautiful and I'm only good at cleaning...

920
01:23:03,587 --> 01:23:06,131
Sophie, you are beautiful.

921
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:13,847
The good thing about being old is that you've so little to lose...

922
01:23:27,653 --> 01:23:29,488
Why's that flying here?

923
01:23:29,696 --> 01:23:30,405
A battleship?

924
01:23:30,614 --> 01:23:31,949
On its way to burn cities and people.

925
01:23:32,542 --> 01:23:33,468
- The enemy's?

926
01:23:33,488 --> 01:23:34,414
Ours?

927
01:23:34,434 --> 01:23:35,360
- What difference does it make?

928
01:23:48,382 --> 01:23:49,466
Murderers.

929
01:23:57,182 --> 01:23:59,893
Look at all those bombs.

930
01:24:15,993 --> 01:24:17,119
It stopped.

931
01:24:17,327 --> 01:24:18,829
Did you do that?

932
01:24:19,047 --> 01:24:20,237
I'm just tinkering.

933
01:24:20,257 --> 01:24:21,447
It won't crash.

934
01:24:25,043 --> 01:24:25,836
Howl!

935
01:24:26,211 --> 01:24:28,630
Oops, looks like they're onto us.

936
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,902
Madam Suliman's deputies.

937
01:24:39,922 --> 01:24:41,424
Let's go back.

938
01:24:41,653 --> 01:24:42,696
Run!

939
01:24:42,716 --> 01:24:43,759
Move those legs!

940
01:24:58,035 --> 01:24:59,161
Hurry on in!

941
01:24:59,379 --> 01:25:00,276
No!

942
01:25:00,296 --> 01:25:01,193
Don't let go!

943
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:12,174
What happened, Sophie?

944
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:15,093
I've had it with this place!

945
01:25:25,103 --> 01:25:26,897
Good night, Sophie.

946
01:25:27,105 --> 01:25:28,315
Good night.

947
01:25:30,317 --> 01:25:32,569
Don't worry about Master Howl, Sophie.

948
01:25:32,778 --> 01:25:34,738
Sometimes, he's gone for days on end.

949
01:25:35,781 --> 01:25:37,240
Thank you, Markl.

950
01:25:37,709 --> 01:25:38,877
- Need the toilet?

951
01:25:38,897 --> 01:25:40,065
- I'm fine.

952
01:25:40,285 --> 01:25:42,204
Good night.

953
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:43,371
You're in love.

954
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:49,628
Sighing away like that.

955
01:26:01,473 --> 01:26:03,141
I thought so.

956
01:26:03,475 --> 01:26:05,769
Were you ever in love?

957
01:26:05,987 --> 01:26:07,344
Of course I was.

958
01:26:07,364 --> 01:26:08,721
I'm still in love.

959
01:26:08,939 --> 01:26:09,856
What?

960
01:26:10,357 --> 01:26:13,568
Men, why ever should we want them...

961
01:26:13,777 --> 01:26:15,862
But a young man's heart is so delicious!

962
01:26:16,488 --> 01:26:17,864
Unbelievable.

963
01:26:18,448 --> 01:26:20,951
And so adorable, too.

964
01:26:24,381 --> 01:26:25,758
- What is that?

965
01:26:25,778 --> 01:26:27,155
- Air raid siren.

966
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:29,084
Air raid?

967
01:26:30,627 --> 01:26:31,753
It's not for here.

968
01:26:31,962 --> 01:26:34,631
But best not go out tonight.

969
01:26:36,299 --> 01:26:40,679
Suliman's creatures are searching high and low for our house.

970
01:26:43,807 --> 01:27:25,432
What a good fire, hiding us so well Sophie, a stranger got in!

971
01:27:33,148 --> 01:27:33,982
Mother?

972
01:27:34,441 --> 01:27:36,443
Sophie!

973
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:40,249
Where have you been?

974
01:27:40,269 --> 01:27:41,688
I searched for you everywhere!

975
01:27:42,198 --> 01:27:44,701
But, oh, look how you've aged!

976
01:27:45,368 --> 01:27:47,412
It's all my fault!

977
01:27:49,289 --> 01:27:51,791
I'm so sorry, Sophie!

978
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,835
Mother...

979
01:27:56,379 --> 01:27:58,673
I barely recognize the house.

980
01:27:58,882 --> 01:28:00,633
Who is that?

981
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:02,677
Oh, your landlady.

982
01:28:02,886 --> 01:28:05,972
Sophie, I've got a new husband!

983
01:28:06,473 --> 01:28:07,849
He's such a wonderful man.

984
01:28:08,068 --> 01:28:09,424
And he's rich, too!

985
01:28:09,444 --> 01:28:10,800
We can all live together again.

986
01:28:11,227 --> 01:28:13,563
You'll never have to clean again.

987
01:28:14,314 --> 01:28:17,358
But I'm happy here...

988
01:28:17,567 --> 01:28:18,985
Really?

989
01:28:19,194 --> 01:28:20,070
Oops, I forgot!

990
01:28:20,413 --> 01:28:21,707
My car's waiting.

991
01:28:21,727 --> 01:28:23,021
I've got to run.

992
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:30,789
I'm so glad I found you again.

993
01:28:30,997 --> 01:28:32,999
We'll really catch up next time.

994
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:35,335
In the meantime, you take care.

995
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:42,050
A peeping-bug, eh?

996
01:28:42,258 --> 01:28:45,011
The oldest trick in the book, Suliman.

997
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:46,679
All yours, Cal.

998
01:28:56,356 --> 01:28:58,650
May you find happiness, Mother.

999
01:28:58,868 --> 01:29:00,100
Thank you.

1000
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,352
You too, Sophie.

1001
01:29:05,458 --> 01:29:07,002
I've done what I was told.

1002
01:29:07,022 --> 01:29:08,566
Take me back to my husband.

1003
01:29:08,785 --> 01:29:11,579
Yes, I'm sure Madam Suliman will be pleased.

1004
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:15,583
Forgive me, Sophie...

1005
01:29:19,754 --> 01:29:21,047
Look at all these people.

1006
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:23,435
They're all running away.

1007
01:29:23,455 --> 01:29:25,040
The town will be empty.

1008
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,428
Do you wish to run, too?

1009
01:29:28,555 --> 01:29:30,557
That's what that lady spoke of...

1010
01:29:31,109 --> 01:29:32,694
So, she did.

1011
01:29:32,714 --> 01:29:34,299
I'm glad we made up.

1012
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:36,646
Don't go, Sophie!

1013
01:29:37,699 --> 01:29:39,284
I love you, Sophie.

1014
01:29:39,304 --> 01:29:40,889
Please stay.

1015
01:29:42,453 --> 01:29:43,830
I love you, too, Markl.

1016
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:45,227
Don't worry, I won't go.

1017
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:46,656
Really!

1018
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:49,075
Are we a family?

1019
01:29:49,325 --> 01:29:53,121
Yes, we're family Oh, good!

1020
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:03,923
I'll never let Suliman get hold of Howl.

1021
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:23,109
But the paper says we won.

1022
01:30:23,318 --> 01:30:26,070
Only fools swallow such lies.

1023
01:30:27,206 --> 01:30:28,917
How strange.

1024
01:30:28,937 --> 01:30:30,648
I can't get Calcifer going.

1025
01:30:31,409 --> 01:30:33,119
Grandma, will you stop that?

1026
01:30:33,411 --> 01:30:34,912
Such an awful stink.

1027
01:30:35,121 --> 01:30:38,041
Why deny an old lady her pleasures.

1028
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:46,632
Open the window, Markl I wouldn't open that now...

1029
01:30:48,426 --> 01:30:52,972
In Calcifer's present state, he can't possibly keep them out.

1030
01:30:55,016 --> 01:30:56,100
Markl!

1031
01:31:06,944 --> 01:31:08,237
Close it quick!

1032
01:31:14,837 --> 01:31:16,089
Look after Grandma, Markl.

1033
01:31:16,109 --> 01:31:17,361
I'll check on the shop.

1034
01:31:36,307 --> 01:31:37,892
How dare you, now?

1035
01:31:38,101 --> 01:31:40,353
If you've energy to spare, put out the fires.

1036
01:32:04,794 --> 01:32:05,545
Howl!

1037
01:32:19,308 --> 01:32:20,726
Dramatic as usual...

1038
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:34,907
Howl!

1039
01:32:37,253 --> 01:32:37,712
I'm sorry.

1040
01:32:37,732 --> 01:32:38,191
I had too many enemies, tonight.

1041
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:43,124
Howl, oh, Howl!

1042
01:33:00,151 --> 01:33:01,173
Master Howl!

1043
01:33:01,193 --> 01:33:02,215
Sophie!

1044
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:07,940
Calcifer, be strong.

1045
01:33:12,778 --> 01:33:16,907
Madam, was that a gift from Suliman?

1046
01:33:17,366 --> 01:33:20,244
That granny fed me something nasty!

1047
01:33:21,037 --> 01:33:23,247
Why, if it isn't Howl!

1048
01:33:23,998 --> 01:33:27,585
I feel we need a nice long chat.

1049
01:33:28,252 --> 01:33:29,670
Likewise, Madam.

1050
01:33:29,879 --> 01:33:31,964
But we've no time, now.

1051
01:33:32,558 --> 01:33:34,602
How unlike you.

1052
01:33:34,622 --> 01:33:36,666
You're not running away.

1053
01:33:36,927 --> 01:33:38,512
Until later, then.

1054
01:33:39,523 --> 01:33:41,005
Stay here, Sophie.

1055
01:33:41,025 --> 01:33:42,507
Calcifer will protect you.

1056
01:33:42,725 --> 01:33:44,518
I'll see to things outside.

1057
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:47,480
Wait, Howl!

1058
01:33:47,698 --> 01:33:48,908
Don't go!

1059
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:50,138
Please stay.

1060
01:33:50,785 --> 01:33:52,392
Another round of bombs is coming.

1061
01:33:52,412 --> 01:33:54,019
Even Calcifer can't stop those.

1062
01:33:54,622 --> 01:33:55,478
Let's run away!

1063
01:33:55,498 --> 01:33:56,354
Don't fight.

1064
01:33:56,906 --> 01:33:59,367
I'm through running away.

1065
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:03,162
I've finally found someone I want to protect...

1066
01:34:03,371 --> 01:34:04,497
You.

1067
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:10,211
Howl!

1068
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:36,255
That's our town.

1069
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:42,011
There's Howl.

1070
01:35:51,729 --> 01:35:52,479
Howl!

1071
01:36:02,583 --> 01:36:03,439
Sophie!

1072
01:36:03,459 --> 01:36:04,315
Turnip...

1073
01:36:08,329 --> 01:36:09,955
Markl, come inside!

1074
01:36:10,341 --> 01:36:11,252
Move?

1075
01:36:11,272 --> 01:36:12,183
You're nuts.

1076
01:36:12,203 --> 01:36:13,114
There's nothing there.

1077
01:36:13,459 --> 01:36:16,587
No, as long as we stay here, Howl will keep fighting.

1078
01:36:17,181 --> 01:36:18,766
He's better off a coward.

1079
01:36:18,786 --> 01:36:20,371
Grandma, get up.

1080
01:36:20,591 --> 01:36:21,967
Going for a stroll?

1081
01:36:22,509 --> 01:36:24,345
Suliman will find us, right away!

1082
01:36:24,772 --> 01:36:26,399
She already has.

1083
01:36:26,419 --> 01:36:28,046
At this rate, Howl will never make it back alive.

1084
01:36:28,265 --> 01:36:29,475
Sophie!

1085
01:36:29,683 --> 01:36:30,851
The castle's falling apart.

1086
01:36:31,153 --> 01:36:32,155
That's all right.

1087
01:36:32,175 --> 01:36:33,177
Markl, take Grandma.

1088
01:36:33,395 --> 01:36:34,313
Sure.

1089
01:36:36,649 --> 01:36:37,983
You, too, hop up now.

1090
01:36:38,535 --> 01:36:40,246
I can't!

1091
01:36:40,266 --> 01:36:41,977
My contract says I can't leave the fireplace.

1092
01:36:42,571 --> 01:36:44,990
If you two can't solve this, I'll do it for you.

1093
01:36:45,366 --> 01:36:46,909
Watch it!

1094
01:36:47,378 --> 01:36:48,338
Cut it out!

1095
01:36:48,358 --> 01:36:49,318
Cut it out!

1096
01:36:50,496 --> 01:36:52,539
If I leave, the house will collapse.

1097
01:36:52,748 --> 01:36:53,540
Fine!

1098
01:36:57,544 --> 01:36:58,837
We're out.

1099
01:36:59,213 --> 01:37:01,006
I'd better go last.

1100
01:37:02,257 --> 01:37:05,427
Even I don't know what'll happen...

1101
01:37:34,289 --> 01:37:36,500
I told you, it would collapse.

1102
01:37:36,708 --> 01:37:37,876
Rain!

1103
01:37:40,587 --> 01:37:42,047
Is that heading for town?

1104
01:37:42,256 --> 01:37:43,799
Look after Grandma, Markl.

1105
01:37:44,007 --> 01:37:45,759
Turnip, find us a way in.

1106
01:37:46,937 --> 01:37:48,064
Don't worry, Grandma.

1107
01:37:48,084 --> 01:37:49,211
I'll take care of you.

1108
01:37:52,266 --> 01:37:54,393
Markl, we can get in here.

1109
01:38:04,163 --> 01:38:05,435
The roof's leaking.

1110
01:38:05,455 --> 01:38:06,727
I'll go out.

1111
01:38:07,322 --> 01:38:08,574
Wait here.

1112
01:38:08,782 --> 01:38:10,951
It's wet here...

1113
01:38:16,832 --> 01:38:18,083
Hurry!

1114
01:38:20,294 --> 01:38:21,795
Too damp!

1115
01:38:25,591 --> 01:38:27,217
Bring Grandma here, Markl.

1116
01:38:27,676 --> 01:38:29,344
The castle's empty.

1117
01:38:29,803 --> 01:38:33,348
I told you, if we'd stayed put, Howl and I could've handled it.

1118
01:38:35,485 --> 01:38:36,779
Calcifer, please.

1119
01:38:36,799 --> 01:38:38,093
You're my last hope.

1120
01:38:38,822 --> 01:38:40,137
I want to go to Howl.

1121
01:38:40,157 --> 01:38:41,472
Move the castle.

1122
01:38:42,784 --> 01:38:44,474
I know you can do it.

1123
01:38:44,494 --> 01:38:46,184
You're so strong.

1124
01:38:46,778 --> 01:38:49,990
But there's no chimney here...

1125
01:38:50,282 --> 01:38:51,533
And the wood's damp...

1126
01:38:52,326 --> 01:38:56,622
As the saying goes, "The best blaze brightest in adversity".

1127
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:59,458
I've heard that, but...

1128
01:38:59,666 --> 01:39:00,709
You really think so?

1129
01:39:00,959 --> 01:39:02,836
You're so pretty, Cal.

1130
01:39:03,045 --> 01:39:04,129
Sit here, Grandma.

1131
01:39:04,755 --> 01:39:07,215
Then, give me something of yours, Sophie.

1132
01:39:07,549 --> 01:39:08,467
Of mine?

1133
01:39:08,685 --> 01:39:09,875
I can't do it alone.

1134
01:39:09,895 --> 01:39:11,085
How about your eyes?

1135
01:39:11,303 --> 01:39:12,387
My eyes?

1136
01:39:12,721 --> 01:39:13,972
This?

1137
01:40:19,589 --> 01:40:20,821
Amazing, Calcifer!

1138
01:40:20,841 --> 01:40:22,073
You are the best!

1139
01:40:22,874 --> 01:40:25,419
Imagine what I could do with your eyes and your heart.

1140
01:40:25,762 --> 01:40:27,139
Heart!

1141
01:40:27,159 --> 01:40:28,536
You have a heart?

1142
01:40:31,591 --> 01:40:33,051
Oh, my!

1143
01:40:45,615 --> 01:40:46,763
There's Howl.

1144
01:40:46,783 --> 01:40:47,931
He's trapped!

1145
01:40:53,447 --> 01:40:55,115
Hurry, Calcifer!

1146
01:40:55,824 --> 01:40:57,242
Don't!

1147
01:40:58,034 --> 01:40:58,952
Grandma!

1148
01:40:59,703 --> 01:41:00,912
Stop it!

1149
01:41:01,872 --> 01:41:03,748
Howl's heart!

1150
01:41:05,083 --> 01:41:06,001
Cut it out!

1151
01:41:15,886 --> 01:41:16,761
Grandma!

1152
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:20,891
It's hot, hot!

1153
01:41:21,433 --> 01:41:22,684
Let go!

1154
01:41:23,226 --> 01:41:24,728
You'll die, Grandma!

1155
01:41:24,936 --> 01:41:26,938
No, it's mine!

1156
01:41:45,332 --> 01:41:46,791
Sophie!

1157
01:41:50,545 --> 01:41:51,671
Sophie!

1158
01:41:52,515 --> 01:41:54,142
She's so mean.

1159
01:41:54,162 --> 01:41:55,789
That's mine.

1160
01:42:39,145 --> 01:42:40,856
Oh, no, Heen, look what I've done.

1161
01:42:40,876 --> 01:42:42,587
I poured water on Calcifer.

1162
01:42:45,767 --> 01:42:48,520
What if I've killed Howl, too?

1163
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:16,433
It's moving...

1164
01:43:16,453 --> 01:43:17,746
Is Howl alive?

1165
01:43:17,966 --> 01:43:19,759
Show me where he is.

1166
01:43:41,531 --> 01:43:43,074
The castle door...

1167
01:45:01,402 --> 01:45:02,362
Heen...

1168
01:45:37,939 --> 01:45:38,773
Howl...

1169
01:45:57,583 --> 01:46:00,003
This must be Howl's childhood...

1170
01:47:19,258 --> 01:47:20,073
Howl!

1171
01:47:20,093 --> 01:47:20,908
Calcifer!

1172
01:47:23,179 --> 01:47:24,271
It's Sophie!

1173
01:47:24,291 --> 01:47:25,383
Wait for me!

1174
01:47:25,403 --> 01:47:26,495
I promise I'll come back for you!

1175
01:47:28,216 --> 01:47:30,092
Wait for me in the future!

1176
01:48:03,302 --> 01:48:04,679
I'll walk there.

1177
01:48:04,699 --> 01:48:06,076
Heen, I'll walk.

1178
01:48:06,587 --> 01:48:08,089
I can't stop crying.

1179
01:48:32,655 --> 01:48:33,948
Howl.

1180
01:48:40,496 --> 01:48:43,374
I'm sorry I took so long.

1181
01:48:43,666 --> 01:48:46,294
You've been waiting all this time.

1182
01:48:50,965 --> 01:48:53,467
Take me to Calcifer.

1183
01:49:56,572 --> 01:49:57,490
Is he dead?

1184
01:49:57,698 --> 01:49:59,366
No, he's fine.

1185
01:50:03,913 --> 01:50:05,206
Grandma...

1186
01:50:05,424 --> 01:50:07,156
Don't look at me.

1187
01:50:07,176 --> 01:50:08,908
I don't have anything.

1188
01:50:09,418 --> 01:50:10,252
Please.

1189
01:50:12,838 --> 01:50:14,215
Grandma.

1190
01:50:17,051 --> 01:50:19,553
You want it that badly?

1191
01:50:19,762 --> 01:50:20,805
Yes.

1192
01:50:21,774 --> 01:50:23,735
Oh, well, in that case...

1193
01:50:23,755 --> 01:50:25,716
You'd better take good care of it.

1194
01:50:26,352 --> 01:50:27,645
There.

1195
01:50:28,938 --> 01:50:31,190
Thank you, Grandma.

1196
01:50:47,331 --> 01:50:48,582
Calcifer.

1197
01:50:49,969 --> 01:50:51,262
Sophie...

1198
01:50:51,282 --> 01:50:52,575
I'm all worn out.

1199
01:50:52,795 --> 01:50:56,090
If I give Howl's heart back, will it kill you?

1200
01:50:56,298 --> 01:50:58,676
Probably not, if you do it, Sophie.

1201
01:50:59,552 --> 01:51:03,639
After all, we both survived the water you dumped on me.

1202
01:51:03,847 --> 01:51:05,266
I'd better try, then.

1203
01:51:08,727 --> 01:51:11,939
It's all warm and fluttery like a little bird.

1204
01:51:12,147 --> 01:51:14,191
It's still only a child's heart.

1205
01:51:15,317 --> 01:51:21,448
May Calcifer live a thousand years, and may Howl recover his heart...

1206
01:51:33,335 --> 01:51:34,211
I'm alive!

1207
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:35,879
I'm free!

1208
01:51:42,553 --> 01:51:44,430
He moved, he's alive!

1209
01:51:48,934 --> 01:51:50,644
You broke Calcifer's spell!

1210
01:52:05,701 --> 01:52:06,493
Turnip!

1211
01:52:19,757 --> 01:52:21,091
Turnip, are you Ok?

1212
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:23,052
I'll get you a new stick, right away.

1213
01:52:25,846 --> 01:52:27,765
Thank you, Turnip.

1214
01:52:35,814 --> 01:52:37,232
Thank you, Sophie.

1215
01:52:38,484 --> 01:52:40,652
I'm a prince from the next kingdom.

1216
01:52:40,861 --> 01:52:42,863
A cruel spell turned me into a scarecrow.

1217
01:52:43,238 --> 01:52:46,408
A spell that only your beloved's kiss could break.

1218
01:52:46,627 --> 01:52:48,859
Exactly.

1219
01:52:48,879 --> 01:52:51,111
And if Sophie hadn't saved me, I would have died.

1220
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:53,832
My, you're good-looking.

1221
01:52:54,051 --> 01:52:55,344
What a racket!

1222
01:52:55,364 --> 01:52:56,657
What's the fuss?

1223
01:52:57,679 --> 01:52:58,764
I feel terrible.

1224
01:52:58,784 --> 01:52:59,869
Like I'm trapped under a stone.

1225
01:53:00,422 --> 01:53:02,633
Oh, yes, a heart's a heavy burden.

1226
01:53:03,175 --> 01:53:06,553
Oh, Sophie, your hair is just like starlight.

1227
01:53:07,095 --> 01:53:08,096
It's so beautiful.

1228
01:53:08,315 --> 01:53:09,421
I love you, Howl!

1229
01:53:09,441 --> 01:53:10,547
How wonderful!

1230
01:53:12,976 --> 01:53:15,312
So, now you see how Sophie feels.

1231
01:53:15,521 --> 01:53:19,483
You'd best go home and make them stop this war.

1232
01:53:19,691 --> 01:53:20,901
That's exactly what I shall do.

1233
01:53:21,610 --> 01:53:24,571
When the war is over, I shall return.

1234
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:27,157
"A fickle heart is the only constant in this world."

1235
01:53:27,991 --> 01:53:43,090
My, you have a way with words I'll wait for your return, then Why should you contact me now?

1236
01:53:43,298 --> 01:53:45,092
What on earth have you been up to?

1237
01:53:48,470 --> 01:53:50,639
A happy ending, I see.

1238
01:53:50,889 --> 01:53:52,516
You two-timer.

1239
01:53:59,398 --> 01:54:01,233
Well, there it is.

1240
01:54:01,650 --> 01:54:05,112
Bring the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense.

1241
01:54:05,862 --> 01:54:09,366
Let's put an end to this foolish war.

1242
01:54:10,325 --> 01:54:11,785
It's Calcifer!

1243
01:54:12,661 --> 01:54:14,830
You didn't have to come back.

1244
01:54:17,676 --> 01:54:19,325
I really missed you all.

1245
01:54:19,345 --> 01:54:20,994
Besides, it looks like rain...

1246
01:54:21,211 --> 01:54:23,213
Thank you, Calcifer.

1247
01:54:39,062 --> 01:59:05,829
Though we slipped apart Like sunlight through the leaves The promise of love Will live on eternally Even though I'm alone now My tomorrows are boundless Like the kindness you showed me Hidden in the night Somehow I lost you Among all my memories In a brook's gentle laughter In the scent of a flower In the depth of the sky You will live on eternally From the Novel By Diana Wynne Jones Music By Joe HISAISHI Theme Song Performed By Chieko BAISHO Production Studio Ghibli Producer Toshio SUZUKI Written and Directed By Hayao MIYAZAKI The End
