2
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:24,400
He would make his way into the mountain forest and cut wild bamboo, from which he made all sorts of useful things...

3
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,215
His name was Sanuki no Miyatsuko.

4
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,700
One day he noticed a light shining from inside a bamboo stalk...

5
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,559
Curious the bamboo cutter approached it.

6
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,700
As he approached it, the light flowed into the ground...

7
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,045
creating something he had never seen before.

8
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,000
What is this?

9
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,140
Bamboo shoot sprouting so early?

10
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,190
Even before the plums?

11
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,300
What is this?

12
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,085
Have mercy on me!

13
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:28,858
Hello...

14
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:34,000
May I ask please, who might you be, my lady?

15
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,217
Oh my!

16
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:07,094
She is such a beautiful little princess!

17
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:09,972
It's a miracle!

18
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:12,516
This must be a blessing from Heaven, I'm sure of it!

19
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,817
You're back early.

20
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:05,944
Something wrong?

21
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:16,705
Ah!

22
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:17,747
What a beautiful little doll!

23
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:18,999
No quiet, you'll wake her.

24
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,125
She's sleeping.

25
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:20,765
Ah!

26
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:21,279
Shh.

27
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:21,793
Shh.

28
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,936
She just appeared to me in the grove.

29
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,187
Appeared?

30
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,523
Definetly a blessing from Heaven!

31
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,414
Hey!

32
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:38,228
Heaven gave it to me!

33
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:39,291
Oh?

34
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:40,230
Well I'm the one who'll raise her.

35
00:04:40,374 --> 00:04:42,172
Raise her?

36
00:04:42,192 --> 00:04:43,990
She's already a perfect little princess.

37
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,642
No no no!

38
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:47,194
Don't be silly, there is more to raising a child than you think.

39
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:48,747
Right?

40
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:55,412
Here let me take her...

41
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:56,289
Oh!

42
00:05:11,655 --> 00:05:13,462
Don't just sit there!

43
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:15,289
Go find a lenght of cloth or something warm I can wrap her in!

44
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,890
Don't be upset, sweetheart.

45
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,390
We're gonna take very good care of you.

46
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,890
I promise.

47
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,029
Will this work?

48
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,463
There, there!

49
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:25,779
You're gonna be just fine.

50
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:27,095
That's a good girl!

51
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:27,895
What's happening?

52
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:28,598
What's going on?

53
00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:30,341
Can't you see?

54
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:31,988
She wants me to be the person who raises her!

55
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,500
Bring me one of the good baskets, please.

56
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,057
Alright!

57
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:40,524
This is really strange, you know.

58
00:05:40,544 --> 00:05:41,991
I mean think about it...

59
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,677
What if she's a woodland spirit or something?

60
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,637
What does she look like to you?

61
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,431
A little baby, of course.

62
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,390
That's right!

63
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,800
But she was a beautiful princess just a moment ago!

64
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:57,024
Well I have to believe thats Heaven showing us what a beautiful princess she's going to become someday when she's all grown up.

65
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:57,983
You're right!

66
00:05:58,118 --> 00:05:59,996
Of course.

67
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:01,894
So that means we have to raise the baby properly right from the start.

68
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,729
Yes, that must be it.

69
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:05,439
I see I'm glad you understand.

70
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,826
I'll be right there helping!

71
00:06:07,961 --> 00:06:08,859
Wait!

72
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,777
We have to find a breast for her.

73
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,747
That's why I'm taking her to a wet nurse.

74
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,042
Yes, I heard there was a new baby in the woodworker settlement.

75
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,168
Is that what this is for?

76
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,379
Yes, we had to bring a gift.

77
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,340
What's wrong?

78
00:06:35,948 --> 00:06:37,325
Hey!

79
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:38,722
Hey what are you doing?

80
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:42,643
Oh you poor thing!

81
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:44,270
I guess you were really hungry.

82
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:45,581
How did you do that?

83
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,414
You see?

84
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:49,149
She's very content, she's drinking it right down.

85
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,602
Yeah!

86
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,622
I can't begin to explain it, but I have milk!

87
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,817
She's laughing!

88
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,153
She's laughing!

89
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:26,082
Ah!

90
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:27,396
I might be imagining it but she feels heavier.

91
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,313
No!

92
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,105
That can't be!

93
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,550
What's the matter?

94
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,801
She just got even heavier!

95
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:48,876
What?

96
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:49,836
Let me see.

97
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,599
She seems to be growing right before our very eyes.

98
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,149
Look!

99
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:13,651
The plum blossoms!

100
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,464
I think she's got a little heavier!

101
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,049
You see?

102
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,500
She's certainly healthy!

103
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,800
And from that day forward the Bamboo Cutter and his wife...

104
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:39,895
carefully raised this miraculous child, as if she were their very own.

105
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:42,448
Careful!

106
00:09:42,468 --> 00:09:44,242
You do not want to touch those.

107
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:52,669
Look!

108
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:53,590
There's a baby in there!

109
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,596
Can you make it?

110
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,015
Stop pushing!

111
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,818
See?

112
00:09:58,838 --> 00:09:59,506
There she is!

113
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:20,860
Hey!

114
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,652
She's looking over here!

115
00:10:21,798 --> 00:10:22,112
Yeah!

116
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:22,446
She is!

117
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:23,832
No she's not!

118
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,268
What's the matter?

119
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,327
Oh!

120
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,578
Hey!

121
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,475
Princess!  Princess!

122
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,357
She's standing!

123
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,400
She's begun to walk!

124
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,370
Oh!

125
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,370
Hey now!

126
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,261
Alright...

127
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,502
Hah!

128
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:01,294
That kid's weird!

129
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,514
She can walk now!

130
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:03,192
Yeah!

131
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:03,755
She was just crawling.

132
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,434
I think she just got bigger too!

133
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:06,862
She grows fast!

134
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:08,050
Like bamboo!

135
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:09,052
That'll be her name!

136
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:09,928
Little Bamboo!

137
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,106
That's perfect!

138
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,441
Little Bamboo!

139
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,109
Little Bamboo!

140
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,277
Little Bamboo!

141
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:16,574
What do you mean Little Bamboo?

142
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:17,756
She's Princess!

143
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:18,938
Princess!

144
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,782
Little Bamboo!

145
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,909
Little Bamboo!

146
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,786
Little Bamboo!

147
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:36,684
Princess!

148
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:37,664
Come here!

149
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,926
Princess... come here!

150
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,304
Princess... come here!

151
00:12:44,768 --> 00:12:46,043
Atta girl!

152
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:47,338
Come here Little Bamboo!

153
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:48,633
Be quiet!

154
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,020
Little Bamboo!

155
00:12:50,197 --> 00:12:51,240
Princess!

156
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,303
Come here!

157
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,316
Princess... come here!

158
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:55,515
Little Bamboo!

159
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:56,391
Princess... come here!

160
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,278
Little Bamboo!

161
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,822
Princess, Princess... come here Little Bamboo!

162
00:13:00,957 --> 00:13:03,388
...come here, Princess!

163
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,839
C'mon Princess!

164
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,776
Princess!

165
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:07,612
Come here!

166
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:08,695
Princess!

167
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:09,487
Come here!

168
00:02:11,010 --> 00:07:42,445
 00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,707 00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,910 131   That's my girl!

169
00:07:42,465 --> 00:13:13,900
Yeah!

170
00:13:56,605 --> 00:13:57,427
You wanna come with me?

171
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:58,269
C'mon!

172
00:14:16,665 --> 00:14:19,150
We'll have these bamboo shoots for dinner.

173
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:20,163
Dinner!

174
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:21,060
Dinner!

175
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,957
Bamboo shoot!

176
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:22,854
Bamboo shoot!

177
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,700
Alright now!

178
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,827
Stand back Princess.

179
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,400
There's lots of them!

180
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,129
Yeah!

181
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,900
Come here!

182
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,140
Stupid!

183
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,600
You don't mess with wild boar piglets!

184
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,072
Huh?

185
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,294
You're really a strange kid!

186
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:51,983
It looks like you just got bigger!

187
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,163
That kid's weird, Sutemaru.

188
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,599
Woh!

189
00:15:56,619 --> 00:15:57,378
Look at her!

190
00:15:57,398 --> 00:15:58,157
She's grown again!

191
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,669
She's just like a bamboo shoot.

192
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:01,920
Yeah you're right!

193
00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:02,849
Bamboo shoot!

194
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:03,663
For dinner!

195
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:05,100
Bamboo shoot!

196
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,996
Bamboo shoot!

197
00:16:06,142 --> 00:16:07,156
Bamboo shoot!

198
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:08,190
Little Bamboo!

199
00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:19,135
* Go round, go round * * Waterwheel, go round * * Go round, and call Mr.

200
00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:25,725
Sun * * Birds, bugs, beasts, grass, flowers and trees * * Spring, summer, autumn, winter * * bring 'em all on * * Go round, go round * * Waterwheel go round * * Go round and call Mr.

201
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:32,315
Sun * * Spring, summer, autumn, winter * * bring 'em all on * * Spring, summer, autumn, winter * * bring 'em all on * Birds!

202
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:38,905
Bugs!

203
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:45,495
Beasts!

204
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,155
Grass!

205
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:46,690
Flowers!

206
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,611
Flowers!

207
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,332
And trees!

208
00:02:42,010 --> 00:06:15,775
 00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,509 00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:50,385 162    00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:50,385 00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,636 163   * Go round and call Mr.

209
00:06:15,795 --> 00:09:49,560
Sun *  00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,056 Hey!

210
00:09:49,580 --> 00:13:23,345
Tell me something?

211
00:13:23,365 --> 00:16:57,130
How come you know this song?

212
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,518
I just know it!

213
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:25,045
* Go round, go round * * Waterwheel go round * * Distant time, come round * * Oh distant time * Come round, call back my heart Come round, call back my heart Birds, bugs, beasts, grass, flowers...

214
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:36,121
...and trees Teach people how to feel  00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:32,847 If I hear that you pine for me...

215
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:49,115
I will want to return to you, I will want to return to you...

216
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,574
Those aren't the words.

217
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:55,523
Hey!

218
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:56,357
She's crying!

219
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,702
Yeah she is!

220
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,163
What's wrong?

221
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,083
I don't know.

222
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,293
She's so weird!

223
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:08,933
Look!

224
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:09,955
That's where our houses are.

225
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,425
And that's your bamboo grove.

226
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:16,627
Yeah!

227
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:17,669
Bamboo shoots!

228
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:20,975
It's time to go!

229
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:22,975
C'mon!

230
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,108
Princess!

231
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,692
Princess!

232
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,800
Where are you?

233
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,089
Where... where are you?

234
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:36,188
Where could she have gone?

235
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,506
What is that?

236
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,655
What's this?

237
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:00,925
I'll be back later!

238
00:03:16,010 --> 00:11:39,578
 00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,076 00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,176 196   Be careful now!

239
00:11:39,598 --> 00:20:03,166
I will!

240
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,633
I'm a little worried, those boys are rough.

241
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:07,448
She might get hurt playing with them.

242
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:08,886
They're fine, don't worry.

243
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:10,200
It's good for her.

244
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:14,422
Yeah, it's just that up in the bamboo grove...

245
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:23,317
Ah... no, it's nothin' No no, that's lacquer!

246
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:31,805
You'll get a rash!

247
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,274
Lacquer?

248
00:20:38,243 --> 00:20:40,156
That smells good!

249
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,909
He's gonna make bowls out of those.

250
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,327
Really?

251
00:00:207,000 --> 00:20:52,919
 00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,749 00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,919 207   That's my father, my brother and my mother.

252
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:07,270
Goodbye!

253
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:07,784
Bye!

254
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:08,298
Bring us a present!

255
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,490
Bye!

256
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,490
Bring us back a present!

257
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,941
This is the Bamboo Cutter's daughter.

258
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:17,986
Little Bamboo.

259
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:26,568
Little Bamboo!

260
00:21:26,588 --> 00:21:28,070
It's okay, c'mon jump!

261
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,683
It's really hot!

262
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,185
I'm thirsty.

263
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:07,045
I bet those...

264
00:22:07,065 --> 00:22:08,442
I bet those are so sweet.

265
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:09,912
They are?

266
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,362
Hey!

267
00:22:11,382 --> 00:22:11,904
Come back!

268
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,551
Let's go!

269
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,012
Someone's coming!

270
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,277
Leave it!

271
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,428
I'll save this for the others.

272
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,988
Delicious!

273
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,823
Delicious!

274
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:46,819
Then when I saw these beautiful robes shooting up in the air, I finally realized...

275
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,155
what Heaven wishes to be done.

276
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,866
What Heaven wishes to be done?

277
00:24:53,085 --> 00:24:55,756
Think of Princess a way of life, that is appropriate to this robe.

278
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:58,447
Raise her as a Princess of noble rank.

279
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,042
That is what Heaven expects of us!

280
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,836
What are you saying?

281
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,143
With this gold I was given.

282
00:25:08,163 --> 00:25:10,416
I am going to build the Princess a fine mansion in the capital.

283
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,226
You're taking her to the capital?

284
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,185
I must.

285
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,396
Out here in these mountains she's  nothing but a country girl.

286
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:25,434
Up in the capital she'll become a noble  princess...

287
00:25:25,454 --> 00:25:28,190
She'll have the opportunity to meet other nobility...

288
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,238
And I believe she'll be happier.

289
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:34,300
Well, in any case, that is the command of the Heavens.

290
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,410
I don't know about this...

291
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:37,828
Well I do.

292
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:41,249
Anyway, tomorrow I will travel to the capital.

293
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,186
From the next day on, the old Bamboo Cutter went to the capital city often...

294
00:26:11,311 --> 00:26:16,240
with the front of his kimono filled with gold.

295
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:24,083
The summer season passed, and the time of the autumn harvest came round.

296
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:30,758
* Blow wind, blow, blow * * Blow, blow hard, oh wind * Little Bamboo!

297
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:34,774
Can you please take him?

298
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:38,790
Sure!

299
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:45,933
* Bring the fruit of the mountains * * Chestnuts, chestnuts... * * Mushrooms, mountain, mountain grapes * Pick up!

300
00:26:45,953 --> 00:26:52,976
Pick up!

301
00:26:57,918 --> 00:26:59,087
Pick up!

302
00:26:59,107 --> 00:27:00,276
Pick up!

303
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,677
I'm gonna get this all over you!

304
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,171
Look!

305
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:21,963
A pheasant!

306
00:27:22,985 --> 00:27:24,195
It's heading for you!

307
00:27:24,215 --> 00:27:25,425
Little Bamboo!

308
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:26,719
Little Bamboo!

309
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:27,887
Chase it to the left!

310
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,148
I got it!

311
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,037
It's coming your way Sutemaru!

312
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,000
You're not getting away!

313
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,892
Sutemaru!

314
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:05,696
Sutemaru!

315
00:28:05,716 --> 00:28:06,385
Sutemaru!

316
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:10,897
Sutemaru are you okay?

317
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:15,225
Sutemaru!

318
00:28:15,245 --> 00:28:16,017
Sutemaru!

319
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,703
I got it.

320
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,538
I got it!

321
00:28:25,881 --> 00:28:27,358
Yeah he got it!

322
00:28:27,378 --> 00:28:28,855
That's awazing!

323
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:29,917
Are you okay?

324
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,419
I'm coming down to help you.

325
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,914
It wont hold!

326
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:44,631
Sutemaru!

327
00:28:44,651 --> 00:28:45,798
I'm really sorry!

328
00:28:45,818 --> 00:28:46,965
Are you okay?

329
00:28:47,486 --> 00:28:49,218
Stupid!

330
00:28:49,238 --> 00:28:50,970
Those rocks are too loose to climb!

331
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:53,774
I'm sorry.

332
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,110
Go find a long piece of ivy and bring it here!

333
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,486
Yeah okay!

334
00:28:58,873 --> 00:29:00,020
Oh!

335
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,187
Hey you're bleeding!

336
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,659
It's nothing a little bit of spit won't fix.

337
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:04,966
No!

338
00:29:04,986 --> 00:29:05,490
Wait!

339
00:00:276,000 --> 00:29:22,762
 00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:07,955 00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,762 276   There you go.

340
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,308
Little Bamboo...

341
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,186
Have you gotten bigger again?

342
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:31,531
Yeah?

343
00:29:31,551 --> 00:29:32,761
You think so?

344
00:29:33,783 --> 00:29:35,926
I do.

345
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:38,089
I have this feeling you're gonna keep on growing...

346
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,614
and go somewhere different, and leave us behind.

347
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,493
I don't know why you would say that?

348
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:50,456
Your Little Bamboo will always be here with you, forever and ever.

349
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:53,417
And I'll always be a part of your gang, forever and ever, too.

350
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,085
Sutemaru!

351
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,504
Is this one alright?

352
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,297
Looks good.

353
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,595
Tie it to a tree!

354
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,679
We did!

355
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:06,806
Good!

356
00:30:10,152 --> 00:30:10,632
Here.

357
00:30:10,652 --> 00:30:11,132
Thanks.

358
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,618
Hey, look at this!

359
00:30:16,638 --> 00:30:18,057
There's mushrooms here!

360
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,194
Look, Sutemaru!

361
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:21,695
They look delicious!

362
00:30:21,831 --> 00:30:23,813
There are so many of them growing here!

363
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,815
Tomorrow we can make stew for everyone!

364
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,253
Yeah!

365
00:30:27,273 --> 00:30:28,316
I'll get the pheasant ready!

366
00:30:28,671 --> 00:30:29,485
Yeah!

367
00:30:29,505 --> 00:30:30,319
Pheasant stew!

368
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,266
Pheasant!

369
00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:33,712
Pheasant!

370
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:35,158
Pheasant stew!

371
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,900
Sorry I'm late.

372
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,666
Sutemaru caught a pheasant.

373
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:53,342
And we found some mushrooms.

374
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,896
Oh, and mountain grapes!

375
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,110
Where are you going?

376
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:02,444
The capital.

377
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,904
The capital?

378
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:06,407
Me, too?

379
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,409
Right now?

380
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,796
Yes.

381
00:31:09,816 --> 00:31:11,068
Just leave the basket on the ground.

382
00:31:11,255 --> 00:31:12,753
What?

383
00:31:12,773 --> 00:31:14,271
But we're making pheasant stew tomorrow.

384
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,789
I promised Sutemaru that we...

385
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,251
Just put it down.

386
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,551
Now, let's go.

387
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,450
Can we come back tomorrow in time for stew?

388
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:56,749
But for the Princess and for Sutemaru, that tomorrow never came.

389
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,499
The young lady is awake.

390
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,506
Good morning, my lady.

391
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,200
If you please...

392
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:53,876
Ah!

393
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:55,231
Well, well, Princess!

394
00:33:55,367 --> 00:34:02,963
And can I ask you, if Your Highness' mood, would you be in the best of spirituals today?

395
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,794
Is that you Momma?

396
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,343
And Papa?

397
00:05:21,010 --> 00:19:54,294
 00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:24,972 00:34:23,777 --> 00:34:27,608 321   You both look so funny!

398
00:19:54,314 --> 00:34:27,598
Why are you dressed like that?

399
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,693
I suppose we aren't doing this right!

400
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:30,944
I am!

401
00:34:31,413 --> 00:34:33,117
My Princess!

402
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,841
Get yourself a change of range.

403
00:34:34,861 --> 00:34:36,565
I mean, a range of chobes!

404
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:39,119
Sorry.

405
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,400
Get a change of robe!

406
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,837
All of these robes are yours, Your Highness.

407
00:34:48,937 --> 00:34:49,937
Wow!

408
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,637
These smell good!

409
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,075
They're beautiful!

410
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:12,485
They're like falling rainbows!

411
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,743
She's having a great time, she seems to like them.

412
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,245
Well, of course!

413
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,665
As of today, this will be our new home.

414
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,263
This mansion is ours?

415
00:35:30,283 --> 00:35:31,826
That's right.

416
00:00:337,000 --> 00:35:44,068
 00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,338 00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:44,068 337   This is fantastic!

417
00:36:09,068 --> 00:36:12,629
Poppa, I can swim in there... can't I?

418
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,302
You most certainly will not swim in there.

419
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:26,768
A noble princess would never frolic, nor even consider part taking in such unlady like antics.

420
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,396
Your Highness...

421
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:34,000
I have thusly summoned Lady Sagami here from the palace to educate you...

422
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,326
in the ways of nobility.

423
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:38,562
Her job is to make you a noble princess!

424
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,574
Noble princess?

425
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,743
From the palace?

426
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:47,863
My Lord!

427
00:36:47,883 --> 00:36:50,407
This child is clearly in desperate need of my instruction.

428
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:58,200
Naturally, I would have liked to have started earlier but I, Sagami, will mould her into a truely fine young lady.

429
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,100
And so the Princess, under Lady Sagami's tutelage...

430
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,767
began to learn the heirs and graces of a noble lady.

431
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:08,602
Watch this carefully.

432
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:11,684
Keep your back like so, as straight as an arrow.

433
00:37:11,704 --> 00:37:14,557
Swish up perfectly, like this.

434
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,444
Swish?

435
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,782
That is approximately correct.

436
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:26,453
The truth is, a noble princess stands only on rare occasions.

437
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,900
But... how do I move if I want to pick up something?

438
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Like this...

439
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:37,130
Come to a kneeling position and schuffle your knees, to move gracefully.

440
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,539
Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.

441
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,087
Notice nothing else moves.

442
00:37:46,608 --> 00:37:48,278
Your Highness!

443
00:37:48,298 --> 00:37:49,968
We are far from done!

444
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,865
Wow!

445
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,000
It is a beautiful scroll, is it not?

446
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:02,989
A proper way of looking at it, is like this, so the story flows.

447
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,920
Look!

448
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,650
Now it's really flowing!

449
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,924
How about a small reward?

450
00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:23,604
Oh!

451
00:38:23,624 --> 00:38:25,501
It makes me so proud to see you practicing your letters...

452
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:30,865
I'm happy to see my teachings are reaching you.

453
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,941
Your Highness!

454
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:46,440
Yes!

455
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,775
Now once more, together.

456
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:54,875
Hey, that was fun!

457
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,543
Your Highness!

458
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,567
How's practice coming along?

459
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,715
Is everything going smoothly?

460
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,717
Ah, My Lord!

461
00:39:10,978 --> 00:39:13,560
I trust you are well, Father.

462
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,062
Oh, my!

463
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,194
You've become so elegant I hardly recognize you.

464
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:27,157
How about the koto lessons, are they coming along as well?

465
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:31,370
We've only just begun... she only knows a few notes!

466
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,385
My, how beautiful!

467
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:58,772
It's very suspicious and I'm starting to wonder if someone else has trained her before...

468
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:02,780
In front of you, she performs perfectly but with me, she's all games!

469
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:03,819
Oh!

470
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:04,768
That's right!

471
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,781
Her Highness' a being who has come straight down from Heaven.

472
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:11,952
She was never supposed to stay in the mountains like some kind of common girl.

473
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:20,500
With her father watching proudly, the Princess devoted herself to Lady Sagami's training.

474
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,491
What is happening here?

475
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,453
Why are you still behaving like some kind of a servant!

476
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:58,123
You are, if nothing else, the mother to a noble princess.

477
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:01,334
But this is the only way I feel at ease living in this house.

478
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,338
And it's because you feel that way the princess never changes her...

479
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,052
Princess, what's wrong?

480
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,514
You're extremely quiet today.

481
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,683
Come over here and listen husband...

482
00:41:25,327 --> 00:41:26,495
What?

483
00:41:26,515 --> 00:41:27,683
Really?

484
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,029
Yes.

485
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:31,625
That's wonderful news!

486
00:41:31,645 --> 00:41:33,522
We'll have to hold a great banquet!

487
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:34,784
A banquet?

488
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,120
A celebration of your coming of age.

489
00:41:37,255 --> 00:41:38,779
Well, of course!

490
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,323
This is the happiest of occasions!

491
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:43,126
If we're having a party,  can we can invite my friends?

492
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,713
I'd love to see them all!

493
00:41:47,015 --> 00:41:48,935
Your friends from the village!

494
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:50,875
That would be wonderful for you.

495
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,552
Don't be stupid!

496
00:41:52,687 --> 00:41:54,778
You don't understand anything!

497
00:41:54,798 --> 00:41:56,889
Do you realize how important this is?

498
00:41:57,516 --> 00:42:01,728
We live in a much different world than those hillbillies back in our old village!

499
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,400
This banquet will make you  a truly noble princess!

500
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:12,097
So right after the new year we'll have a celebration!  With putting up with hair, and the naming ritual.

501
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,323
But Poppa...

502
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:14,481
Ah!

503
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:15,524
This is wonderful!

504
00:42:15,544 --> 00:42:16,567
I mean, it's wonderful!

505
00:42:16,711 --> 00:42:18,624
Wait!

506
00:42:18,644 --> 00:42:20,557
I'll ask Inbe no Akita.

507
00:42:20,577 --> 00:42:22,490
He'll serve as the name father.

508
00:42:23,685 --> 00:42:24,991
Hello?

509
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:26,317
Is anybody there?

510
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:28,698
Lady Sagami?

511
00:42:28,718 --> 00:42:30,504
Lady Sagami?

512
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:34,761
What a bore.

513
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:29,300
* Birds, bugs, beasts * * Grass, flowers and trees * * Teach people how to feel * Momma, would you give a part of the garden to me?

514
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,100
Why?

515
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,944
It would be fun to plant some of the things I like.

516
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,655
Yes, yes of course if it makes you happy.

517
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,241
You can do whatever you want with it.

518
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,493
Thank you, Momma.

519
00:44:02,776 --> 00:44:03,695
No!

520
00:44:03,715 --> 00:44:04,634
Get away!

521
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:12,817
You will never be a noble princess looking as you do now.

522
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,400
Without eyebrows the sweat will run into my eyes!

523
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,819
Don't be ridiculous.

524
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,148
For a noble princess there is nothing that will maker her perspire!

525
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:20,800
Come...

526
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,390
Why would I want black teeth?

527
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,890
I wouldn't open my mouth then!

528
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,705
And I won't be able to laugh anymore!

529
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:30,043
You won't have to worry about that!  For a noble princess does not open her mouth to laugh.

530
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,378
That's stupid!

531
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:36,216
Even a noble princess must sweat and sometimes want to laugh out loud!

532
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:40,200
Surely they wanna cry, or get mad and wanna scream!

533
00:44:38,353 --> 00:44:40,612
 00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,136 Oh no!

534
00:44:40,632 --> 00:44:42,891
A noble princess should never show...

535
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,892
Then a noble princess is not human!

536
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:52,500
Princess!

537
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,652
The poor thing was all tied up!

538
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:01,074
Your Highness!

539
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:06,579
This way, Lord Akita and thank you for coming.

540
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:38,486
Princess!

541
00:45:43,518 --> 00:45:45,367
This is extremely embarassing!

542
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:47,236
I'm afraid she's still but a child.

543
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,955
No... not at all.

544
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,417
She looks like an adorable little princess.

545
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,925
She hasn't been properly made up yet.  I am truly ashamed and I must apologize to you!

546
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,396
No!

547
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:03,752
Please don't give it another thought.

548
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,500
If I see her face as it really is...

549
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:11,478
the better I can divine of a truly appropriate name for the Princess.

550
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,271
Those are very welcome words.

551
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:18,151
I have every confidence that you will bestow upon the princess a very fine name.

552
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:24,323
Please Your Highness, come out and greet this gentlemen who will give you your name.

553
00:46:50,485 --> 00:46:52,137
How do you do, my lord?

554
00:46:52,157 --> 00:46:53,809
It's an honor to meet you.

555
00:46:54,646 --> 00:47:00,693
Your Highness, if you wouldn't mind, perhaps you could perform something, on the koto for our esteemable guest.

556
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,390
Beautiful!

557
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:36,729
The Shining Princess of the Supple Bamboo...

558
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,899
The Shining Princess...

559
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,693
of the Supple Bamboo?

560
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:42,902
Yes.

561
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,739
She has a form as graceful as supple bamboo...

562
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:48,714
and a beauty that radiates out from her!

563
00:47:48,734 --> 00:47:50,490
Superb!

564
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:55,333
So then I add a name for "Princess of the Shining Light" And thus I suggest to you the name "Princess Kaguya" Yes!

565
00:47:55,353 --> 00:48:00,076
How beautiful!

566
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:05,758
I'm so proud, Lord Akita, that is the most wonderful name I've ever heard!

567
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:08,094
Thank you very much.

568
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:55,600
As is the custom, the naming ceremony was followed by putting up the hair and dawning the trailing skirt.

569
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,400
Soon after, large numbers were invited to the great banquet...

570
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,483
to celebrate the naming of Princess Kaguya.

571
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,246
Congratulations sir!

572
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:20,900
Princess Kaguya...  a truly fine name.

573
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:30,277
This is wonderful, right?

574
00:49:30,297 --> 00:49:32,082
Just wonderful.

575
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:48,027
There are many good gentlemen who have come to the banquet!

576
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:53,366
Then the purpose of this banquet is to celebrate the taking of my name?

577
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,535
Of course it is, mam.

578
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,372
Yes, but... all I'm doing is sitting here.

579
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:03,668
It's like...  I'm not even at my own party.

580
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,000
Thank you very much!

581
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:36,576
The banquet to celebrate the naming of Princess Kaguya, went on for three days, and three nights.

582
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:42,373
Here to Princess Kaguya to celebrate the putting up of her hair!

583
00:50:42,508 --> 00:50:43,427
A fine thing!

584
00:50:43,447 --> 00:50:44,366
Yes?

585
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:47,616
A fine thing!

586
00:50:47,636 --> 00:50:50,742
Yes?

587
00:50:50,762 --> 00:50:53,868
A fine thing!

588
00:50:53,888 --> 00:50:56,994
Yes?

589
00:50:57,899 --> 00:50:59,685
Really my friend!

590
00:50:59,705 --> 00:51:01,491
This is all a bit pretentious, don't you think?

591
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:01,800
What?

592
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:04,868
The Princess... the so called Princess C'mon you know what we mean?

593
00:51:04,888 --> 00:51:07,846
Princess Kaguya or whoever...

594
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:11,200
Her flower of a face enshrined behind that blind.

595
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,800
Clearly there wouldn't be any harm in allowing us to see her if she's as beautiful as they say?

596
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:16,323
Yeah!

597
00:51:16,343 --> 00:51:16,756
Why not?

598
00:51:16,776 --> 00:51:17,189
I agree!

599
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,870
No no!

600
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:22,450
I'm afraid that would be out of the question.  What's happening here?

601
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:25,030
We've come to celebrate her naming, and we don't even get to say hello?

602
00:51:25,151 --> 00:51:26,248
I'm sorry!

603
00:51:26,268 --> 00:51:27,365
But that's just the way things are done!

604
00:51:27,512 --> 00:51:29,056
What do you mean?

605
00:51:29,076 --> 00:51:30,620
The way things are done!

606
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:31,547
No wait!

607
00:51:31,682 --> 00:51:33,017
There's no noble princess here!

608
00:51:33,037 --> 00:51:34,372
Yeah!

609
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:35,894
You're right!

610
00:51:35,914 --> 00:51:37,289
Who are you saying Her Highess is?

611
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:39,193
Her Highest?

612
00:51:39,213 --> 00:51:40,996
How much did it cost?

613
00:51:41,016 --> 00:51:42,799
A naming ceremony for this Princess?

614
00:51:42,944 --> 00:51:44,307
Who cares about that?

615
00:51:44,327 --> 00:51:45,690
Atleast show her to us!

616
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,500
Maybe she looks like some kind of goblin!

617
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,816
Or worse!

618
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:49,140
Excuse me?

619
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,290
Where did the people who were living down below go?

620
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,208
I wouldn't know.

621
00:54:54,844 --> 00:54:57,097
They packed themselves up...

622
00:54:57,117 --> 00:54:59,370
Took off on a journey to find better wood.

623
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,715
Better wood?

624
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,050
They probably won't be back for ten years.

625
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,885
Ten years?

626
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,800
If you use up all the trees, the mountain is ruined.

627
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:13,600
But if you leave the mountain its power, and go on a journey...

628
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,144
it comes back to life.

629
00:55:16,164 --> 00:55:18,598
Trees need a good ten years, then you can work them again!

630
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:21,700
It's like that for charcoal burning too.

631
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:27,074
I see... but the mountain looks dead already.

632
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:30,244
The leaves used to be so full and bright here...

633
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:37,084
Everything comes back eventually.

634
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:43,549
See for yourself.

635
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:48,095
The trees are already getting ready for spring.

636
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:51,599
Getting ready?

637
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:53,934
So spring will come back again?

638
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,300
Sure it will.

639
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,600
It's like a circle, just when you think one ends, another begins again.

640
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,468
You can always count on it.

641
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:04,278
So who might you be?

642
00:56:32,108 --> 00:56:34,110
I've seen this before.

643
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,132
I've seen it.

644
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:32,426
From that day forward, it was as if Princess Kaguya...

645
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:37,000
was another person, devoting herself to her studies...

646
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:41,435
and passing her days in silence.

647
00:58:50,913 --> 00:58:52,891
Hey look!

648
00:58:52,911 --> 00:58:54,889
Look at this huge pile of gifts from the nobility!

649
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,786
The high born have now accepted you!

650
00:58:58,888 --> 00:59:00,657
See?

651
00:59:00,677 --> 00:59:02,446
They obviously consider you to be one of them!

652
00:59:10,099 --> 00:59:11,585
You know what?

653
00:59:11,605 --> 00:59:13,091
This bird deserves a much better space...

654
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,600
How about, for old time's sake, I weave you a fine bamboo cage to keep him in?

655
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,400
Now what do you think about that, huh?

656
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,977
Thank you, Father.

657
00:59:29,618 --> 00:59:30,462
Ha-ha!

658
00:59:30,482 --> 00:59:31,326
Wonderful!

659
00:59:31,346 --> 00:59:32,190
It's wonderful!

660
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,068
I mean, wonderful!

661
00:59:34,088 --> 00:59:35,646
Wonderful!

662
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:38,659
I'll just leave the bird right here.

663
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,700
Thanks be to Heaven!

664
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:22,300
As time went on, rumours of the Princess' beauty grew.

665
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,800
The streets outside the mansion became cramped with people...

666
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:32,576
hoping to catch a glimpse, of the mysterious Princess Kaguya.

667
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,200
Are you a servant of Princess Kaguya?

668
01:00:40,522 --> 01:00:41,441
If your are, give her this for me!

669
01:00:41,461 --> 01:00:42,380
Give this to her!

670
01:00:42,524 --> 01:00:43,276
No!

671
01:00:43,296 --> 01:00:44,048
You must give this to her!

672
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:45,559
First!

673
01:00:45,669 --> 01:00:46,439
See that she gets this!

674
01:00:46,459 --> 01:00:47,229
Please!

675
01:00:47,249 --> 01:00:48,019
She needs this gift!

676
01:00:48,129 --> 01:00:50,984
You must take this to her, right away!

677
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:56,779
There's another crowd of gentlemen suitors in the streets.

678
01:00:58,707 --> 01:01:01,210
They've were very persistant.

679
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:03,733
They gave me all these letters and demanded that I pass on to you.

680
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:07,748
And so I am, and since it seems to be impossible for...

681
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:11,919
you to go outside the mansion, I thought I'd bring you some cherry blossoms.

682
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:14,588
Thank you!

683
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:48,288
I hear you have summoned me, Prince Ishitsukuri?

684
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,629
Yes, it's about that rich upstart's daughter whom you named...

685
01:01:55,764 --> 01:01:57,167
Oh!

686
01:01:57,187 --> 01:01:58,590
You're taking about Princess Kaguya?

687
01:01:58,710 --> 01:01:59,407
Shh!

688
01:01:59,427 --> 01:02:00,124
Keep your voice down!

689
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:02,469
Did you say Princess Kaguya?

690
01:02:02,604 --> 01:02:04,044
Woh!

691
01:02:04,064 --> 01:02:05,504
Princess Kaguya?

692
01:02:05,524 --> 01:02:06,964
I've heard the rumours about her.

693
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:09,351
They say that she's very beautiful.

694
01:02:09,945 --> 01:02:11,051
You fool!

695
01:02:11,071 --> 01:02:12,177
You had to raise your voice didn't you?

696
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:15,983
But don't matter how beautiful they say she is...  she is still of humble birth.

697
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:19,153
So she is not a woman appropriate for any of us.

698
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:24,300
Even you have to admit Akita, that Princess Kaguya is a very presumptuous name...

699
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:26,063
to be given the likes of a commoners daughter.

700
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:27,736
No matter how much you paid for it.

701
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,621
Not so, Lord Minister.

702
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:33,834
This beautiful girl is not Miyatsuko's true daughter.

703
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:36,336
She was found in a bamboo stalk.

704
01:02:36,472 --> 01:02:37,202
What?

705
01:02:37,222 --> 01:02:37,952
A bamboo stalk?

706
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,914
Now that's interesting!

707
01:02:39,934 --> 01:02:41,708
She could be some kind of forest spirit!

708
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:46,263
After seeing her with my own eyes... that is entirely possible, my Lord.

709
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:47,514
Really?

710
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:51,810
I must confess, that the moment I stood before Princess Kaguya...

711
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:55,600
this old man's body began to tremble...

712
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:59,400
as if a dry fountain had come flowing back to life!

713
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:05,400
Even remebering her now, words fail to express her glimmering beauty, and my heart...

714
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:09,953
surges as I remember every moment looking at her!

715
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:20,506
Out of the way!

716
01:03:30,025 --> 01:03:30,860
I swear!

717
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:31,715
I will win this race!

718
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,144
I must get to her first!

719
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:37,523
That glimmering beauty will be mine, I tell you, nothing will stop me!

720
01:03:37,699 --> 01:03:38,784
The one who will win her is me!

721
01:03:38,804 --> 01:03:39,889
I swear!

722
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:42,069
She will be my wife!

723
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:55,100
Lady Sagami!  You have to see these!

724
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,458
What is it, my lord?

725
01:03:56,718 --> 01:03:57,553
Just look at these!

726
01:03:57,573 --> 01:03:58,408
Look at them all!

727
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:02,400
Five of the most high-born men in the land have come calling for one simple reason...

728
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,800
they wanna marry the Princess!

729
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:05,900
Oh, my!

730
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:06,790
Oh!

731
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:07,590
Wonderful!

732
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:08,390
Wonderful!

733
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:09,190
All these princes are interested in her...

734
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,265
and even the Minister of the Right!

735
01:04:11,567 --> 01:04:13,486
But how do we choose among them?

736
01:04:13,506 --> 01:04:15,425
It's going to be a very difficult challenge!

737
01:04:15,527 --> 01:04:20,107
And to make matters worse, they are all waiting impatiently in formal dress even as we speak!

738
01:04:20,242 --> 01:04:21,744
I will take care of this.

739
01:04:21,764 --> 01:04:23,266
Leave Her Highness to me.

740
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:25,946
You go entertain them, and whatever you do, keep them happy!

741
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:27,281
Alright, my lady!

742
01:04:27,416 --> 01:04:28,286
Oh and thank you!

743
01:04:28,306 --> 01:04:29,176
Thank you!

744
01:04:29,196 --> 01:04:30,066
Thank you!

745
01:04:31,962 --> 01:04:32,964
Wonderful!

746
01:04:32,984 --> 01:04:33,986
Wonderful!

747
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:37,624
I just knew that banquet was worth putting on!

748
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,779
These are five proposals from five of the most...

749
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:45,132
important nobles in the land.

750
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:48,802
Whichever one you choose, you cannot go wrong!

751
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:51,250
But I've never even met them!

752
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:51,943
Oh!

753
01:04:51,963 --> 01:04:52,546
Please don't worry!

754
01:04:52,691 --> 01:04:55,820
This is very simple!

755
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,969
You'll pick a proposal from one of these noble gentlemen, and then you'll meet him on your wedding day.

756
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:06,525
It hardly matters because with any of these fine princely men, you'll be happy forever... and ever!

757
00:00:602,000 --> 01:05:08,822
 01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,778 01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:08,822 602   I'm supposed to feel happy?

758
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:13,660
I have no intension of marrying anyone yet.

759
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:15,329
Have you lost your mind!

760
01:05:15,454 --> 01:05:20,292
Once you have become a noble princess, you must marry a suitable gentleman as quickly as possible!

761
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:23,003
That is the very defintion of happiness!

762
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:24,838
Why would you even think twice?

763
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:29,009
With any of these men, your happiness would be completely guaranteed.

764
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:31,136
I do not want any of it!

765
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:33,513
So please tell those men to leave.

766
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:39,353
Do you really want to hurt your father like this?

767
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:44,483
Do you understand that he is as happy for you, as he would be for himself?

768
01:05:55,844 --> 01:05:58,427
Everything has been made ready for you.

769
01:05:58,447 --> 01:06:01,030
If you would be so kind to come this way...

770
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:30,070
Now please, express your proposal to the Princess in order.

771
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:35,075
I am Prince Kuramochi.

772
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,576
Princess...

773
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:43,583
as you know my true feelings have been clearly stated in the letter that has been given to you...

774
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:50,300
Your Highness, Princess Kaguya, if I were so fortunate...

775
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,762
that you became my wife, it would be as if I plucked a branch of the tree of jewels...

776
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:58,098
that grows on the Mountain of Horai...

777
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:01,435
whose trunk is of gold and it's fruits are the whitest of pearls.

778
01:07:01,727 --> 01:07:07,274
Princess Kaguya, you are an exquiste treasure that is as unattainable...

779
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:08,275
precious as that...

780
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:10,496
I'm Prince Ishitsukuri!

781
01:07:10,516 --> 01:07:12,602
Princess Kaguya, if you consent to be my wife...

782
01:07:12,748 --> 01:07:14,834
I will worship you morning and night.

783
01:07:14,854 --> 01:07:16,940
My forehead pressed to the ground in utter devotion...

784
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:21,955
you are a treasure I would revear as much as the stone begging bowl of Lord Buddha himself.

785
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,625
You would worship her as if she were some cold stone bowl?

786
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:29,921
Princess Kaguya, to me you are as a robe of fire-rat fur.

787
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:33,759
From which when thrown in the fire, all the impurities is burned away...

788
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:38,803
but which itself is not consumed, only shining more brightly as the flames grow higher...

789
01:07:38,938 --> 01:07:41,157
you are utterly rare.

790
01:07:41,177 --> 01:07:43,396
Untouched and innocent.

791
01:07:43,416 --> 01:07:45,635
As illusive as this treasure about, which they speak of finding in China.

792
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:49,983
You have the goal to compare Princess Kaguya to a rat-skin?

793
01:07:50,118 --> 01:07:53,372
Princess, to me...

794
01:07:53,392 --> 01:07:56,646
Councilor Otomo you are a fine glistening jewel, a jewel that shines intensly from above.

795
01:07:56,782 --> 01:08:01,787
A gem with more radiance than the five colored jewel that shines on the dragon's neck!

796
01:08:01,963 --> 01:08:02,381
Oh!

797
01:08:02,401 --> 01:08:02,819
No, no, no!

798
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,500
For me, Princess Kaguya...

799
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:10,504
is something more precious and natural, like the warm cowry shell amulets, swallows use as a charm...

800
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:12,851
for safe birth.

801
01:08:12,871 --> 01:08:15,083
That is a true treasure!

802
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:16,343
A true treasure...

803
01:08:16,485 --> 01:08:18,665
You think a boring everyday seashell is a treasure?

804
01:08:18,685 --> 01:08:20,865
You must be crazy!

805
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:24,650
Well... well, a dragon's neck stinks you know!

806
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,686
It's on the neck!

807
01:08:50,679 --> 01:08:52,014
What a beautiful sound!

808
01:08:52,034 --> 01:08:53,369
She is truly gifted!

809
01:08:54,349 --> 01:08:56,686
Gentlemen!

810
01:08:56,706 --> 01:08:59,043
I'm most grateful for the sentiments you expressed...

811
01:08:59,178 --> 01:09:02,500
to someone you have never seen or met.

812
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,850
Yet there is something else I require...

813
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:09,896
These rare treasures that are difficult to obtain...

814
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:13,358
I ask... that you bring them to me.

815
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:22,742
Then, and only then, will I be able to clearly and fully  understand how you treasure me in your hearts...

816
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:28,415
Prince Kuramochi, present to me a jewel branch from Mount Horai.

817
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:32,500
Prince Ishitsukuri, the stone begging bowl of Lord Buddha.

818
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:33,090
How?

819
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:33,590
But...

820
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:38,300
Lord Minister of the Right Abe, bring a robe made of fire-rat fur.

821
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,300
Excuse me?

822
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:44,800
Grand Counselor Otomo, obtain the jewel from the great dragon's neck.

823
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:50,100
Middle Counselor Isonokami,  please bring me the swallow's cowry shell...

824
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:50,992
The amulet of easy child birth...

825
01:09:51,012 --> 01:09:51,794
Wait!

826
01:09:51,814 --> 01:09:52,596
Wait... but that!

827
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:54,274
No, no no no...

828
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:57,900
All these items would be impossible to find, even if they do exist!

829
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,100
Princess, these five gentlemen were only using them as comparisons!

830
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:02,900
Yes.

831
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,455
All these gentlemen compared me to very rare treasures.

832
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:12,751
Therefore, whomever can present me the real treasure...

833
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:17,797
I will happily become that noble gentleman's real treasure.

834
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:21,968
Gentlemen please, I humbely apologize!

835
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,763
My daughter knows nothing of the ways of the world.

836
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,942
But she must be a beautiful princess.

837
01:10:26,962 --> 01:10:28,964
Her voice, her music...

838
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,896
Indeed, I must say that melody was quite out of this world.

839
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:36,983
The truth is, she is asking us to achieve an impossible task...

840
01:10:37,285 --> 01:10:38,303
Impossible!

841
01:10:38,323 --> 01:10:39,341
It can't be done!

842
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:42,697
She'll remain a jewel that no one can acquire.

843
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:50,664
This is terrible!

844
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:55,168
When the nobles left, so did all the other people who were waiting in front of the mansion!

845
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:58,171
They disapperaed just like the tide going out.

846
01:10:58,296 --> 01:10:59,506
Exactly.

847
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:01,549
I thought I better let you know right away.

848
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:05,553
Your Highness!

849
01:11:10,151 --> 01:11:10,736
C'mon!

850
01:11:10,756 --> 01:11:11,341
Let's go!

851
01:11:11,486 --> 01:11:12,128
Go?

852
01:11:12,148 --> 01:11:12,790
Where?

853
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:13,700
Outside!

854
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,800
Outside?

855
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:16,190
Yes!

856
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:17,490
Let's go see the cherry blossoms!

857
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:20,860
You know what? we should ask father and mother to come along with us!

858
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:25,490
I'm sorry, but there is no longer anything I can do.

859
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,826
But, but...

860
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:30,996
The next time I'm sure the Princess will try to, ah...

861
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:33,999
There will certainly be no next time!

862
01:11:34,384 --> 01:11:36,428
She has burnt her last bridge.

863
01:11:36,448 --> 01:11:38,492
I will take my leave of you!

864
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,672
Oh no, please don't go...

865
01:11:44,644 --> 01:11:46,459
Squire, the cart the Princess requested has arrived.

866
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:48,294
They are just waiting for you sir.

867
01:11:48,606 --> 01:11:49,942
Tell them to go on ahead without me!

868
01:11:49,962 --> 01:11:51,298
I'm not going!

869
00:00:694,000 --> 01:13:01,252
 01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:51,076 01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:01,252 694   Oh, my!  Beautiful!

870
01:13:04,798 --> 01:13:05,548
Stop here!

871
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:32,640
Oh, my!

872
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:33,990
It's beautiful!

873
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:23,334
I'm very sorry, your Highness.

874
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:29,174
Please forgive us!

875
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,181
Let's go.

876
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,900
The cherry blossoms are right at their peak.

877
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,800
I must say, they're certainly splendid to experience.

878
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:04,190
Let's go home.

879
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:05,390
But...

880
01:15:51,142 --> 01:15:52,200
Keep everyone back!

881
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:53,757
Stay back!

882
01:15:53,777 --> 01:15:54,824
Stay back!

883
01:15:54,844 --> 01:15:55,891
Clear the space here!

884
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,930
There seems to have been an accident up ahead.

885
01:15:59,065 --> 01:16:00,267
Oh!

886
01:16:00,287 --> 01:16:01,489
Someone's running this way.

887
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,600
Sutemaru!

888
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,500
 01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,600 Sutemaru?  This way!

889
01:16:03,618 --> 01:16:13,870
 01:16:03,618 --> 01:16:04,518 Better run little one!

890
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,613
It's Sutemaru!

891
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:18,491
Sutemaru!

892
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:32,797
What are you doing?!

893
01:16:32,932 --> 01:16:33,704
C'mon!

894
01:16:33,724 --> 01:16:34,496
Let's get out of here!

895
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:37,802
We're going!

896
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:51,149
Little Bamboo!

897
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:11,002
Sutemaru!

898
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:13,838
Sutemaru!

899
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,018
Let's go.

900
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,400
Three years passed...

901
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:50,101
Go on.

902
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:04,731
It's a lovely day, isn't it?

903
01:19:04,751 --> 01:19:06,942
The plants in the garden seem to be thriving!

904
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,287
Yes, but you know...

905
01:19:11,122 --> 01:19:14,500
It looks completely different from down here!

906
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,500
Well!

907
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:23,159
Yes!

908
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:29,055
See!

909
01:19:29,075 --> 01:19:30,190
It looks like the mountain, doesn't it?

910
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,267
You're right.

911
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:34,600
There's the forest and a hill...

912
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:35,557
Oh my!

913
01:19:35,577 --> 01:19:36,424
It is just like home!

914
01:19:36,444 --> 01:19:37,291
That's right!

915
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:38,940
And see the cogan grass?

916
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,490
It looks just like the bamboo grove.

917
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,000
And the mugwort looks just like trees!

918
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:45,090
And Mr.

919
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:47,090
Moon could rise up from right behind those mountains, couldn't it?

920
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,100
Yes!

921
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:49,490
And look!

922
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:50,790
We can go across that bridge and climb over the hill...

923
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,330
Princess!

924
01:19:52,632 --> 01:19:53,884
Princess!

925
01:19:53,904 --> 01:19:55,156
Where is the Princess?

926
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:57,168
You're in the kitchen again?

927
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:59,200
And what's wrong with that once in a while?

928
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,500
It's not once in a while, it's all the time!

929
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,150
Anyway...  I have news about Kuramochi!

930
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:04,850
What?

931
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:07,700
He brought back the jeweled branch from Mount Horai!

932
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,700
It's quite an accomplishment!

933
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:10,795
Impossible!

934
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,444
Yes, yes!

935
01:20:12,464 --> 01:20:14,008
And I never thought such a thing would happen, believe me...

936
01:20:14,153 --> 01:20:16,073
he is true to his word!

937
01:20:16,093 --> 01:20:18,013
An impossible task, and he pulled it off!

938
01:20:18,157 --> 01:20:20,494
I wouldn't be surprised if he would had me!

939
01:20:20,514 --> 01:20:22,851
But he really did what he said he'd do!

940
01:20:23,663 --> 01:20:25,832
Now!

941
01:20:25,852 --> 01:20:28,021
After we recieve the gift, you must prepare yourself quickly to be married to the Prince.

942
01:20:28,167 --> 01:20:28,918
My heavens!

943
01:20:28,938 --> 01:20:29,689
I have to go!

944
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:33,204
I must prepare a bedchamber for the Prince and Your Highness!

945
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:38,000
If only Lady Sagami were here!

946
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:42,463
I don't believe it!

947
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,000
Prepare a bedchamber...?

948
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,595
Where is the Princess?

949
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:52,056
Quickly where is Princess Kaguya?

950
01:20:52,191 --> 01:20:53,401
Please wait, Your Highness!

951
01:20:53,421 --> 01:20:54,631
Please wait!

952
01:20:57,196 --> 01:20:57,816
Ah!

953
01:20:57,836 --> 01:20:58,456
Mr.

954
01:20:58,476 --> 01:20:59,096
Miyatsuko!

955
01:20:59,522 --> 01:21:01,399
Please forgive my appearance.

956
01:21:01,624 --> 01:21:06,900
I was so anxious to get here,  I didn't have time to change my traveling clothes!

957
00:12:43,010 --> 00:35:32,423
 01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:06,924 01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,300 763   Your Highness!

958
00:35:32,443 --> 00:58:21,856
Your presence is always welcome here!

959
00:58:21,876 --> 01:21:11,289
This is most truly wonderful!

960
01:21:11,410 --> 01:21:12,479
Please... come in!

961
01:21:12,499 --> 01:21:13,568
I'll show you the way.

962
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:17,915
Splendid.

963
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:39,270
Without further ado, I will present the promised object.

964
01:21:58,257 --> 01:21:59,082
What can I say?

965
01:21:59,102 --> 01:21:59,927
It's dazzling!

966
01:21:59,947 --> 01:22:00,772
It leaves me speechless!

967
01:22:00,792 --> 01:22:01,617
It's so... what the...

968
01:22:01,761 --> 01:22:04,014
It is as you requested.

969
01:22:04,034 --> 01:22:06,287
The jeweled branch of Mount Horai.

970
01:22:07,099 --> 01:22:08,810
Princess Kaguya, can you see it?

971
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,541
Come closer!

972
01:22:11,103 --> 01:22:12,773
Here!

973
01:22:12,793 --> 01:22:14,463
I will bring it closer to you.

974
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:16,140
One moment, please.

975
01:22:16,776 --> 01:22:19,779
First, allow me to ask you how you found it.

976
01:22:19,799 --> 01:22:22,802
It must be quite a story...

977
01:22:23,282 --> 01:22:24,367
Oh!

978
01:22:24,387 --> 01:22:25,472
It is quite a story!

979
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:46,462
Three years ago I vowed to carry out your Highness' wish...

980
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:48,506
I then set my plan in motion...

981
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:52,677
from the harbor at Naniwa I set course for the Mountain of Horai.

982
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,513
We were tossed by fierce waves...

983
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:58,200
we nearly starved from lack of food...

984
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:02,520
and after a grueling, harrowing journey...

985
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,022
Behold!

986
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:10,695
What is that mountain, so forbidding yet so very beautiful?

987
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,698
What is this?

988
01:23:13,823 --> 01:23:17,702
It flows with water of gold and precious gems!

989
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,203
Look!

990
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:23,040
A maiden scoops water with a silver bowl!

991
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,292
Dear Maiden...

992
01:23:25,835 --> 01:23:28,546
please tell me what is the name of that mountain?

993
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:33,050
That is the Mountain of Horai.

994
01:23:33,676 --> 01:23:37,388
And you are very brave to have travelled so far!

995
01:23:39,191 --> 01:23:41,361
Ah!

996
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:43,551
I had finally arrived at the Mountain of Horai!

997
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:49,567
Without a second glance at the lovely maiden, I climbed the mountain.

998
01:23:51,037 --> 01:23:52,539
Behold!

999
01:23:52,559 --> 01:23:54,061
Those precious, exquiste trees!

1000
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:59,700
Silver branches, a trunk of gold and fruit of pearls!

1001
01:23:59,810 --> 01:24:01,180
So beautiful!

1002
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,570
It takes my breath away...

1003
01:24:03,933 --> 01:24:07,000
Are these not the jeweled branches of Horai...

1004
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:10,421
the very thing that Princess Kaguya said she wished?

1005
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:16,761
And thus, without haste, I snapped off this branch to bring to your feet.

1006
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,104
One look is worth a hundred stories.

1007
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:30,608
Please, won't you see for yourself Your Highness!

1008
01:24:39,085 --> 01:24:40,170
Stop!

1009
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:41,275
You shall not pass!

1010
01:24:41,389 --> 01:24:42,540
Move!

1011
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:43,711
Get out of my way!

1012
01:24:44,256 --> 01:24:45,258
What is that?

1013
01:24:45,278 --> 01:24:46,280
What's going on?

1014
01:24:46,467 --> 01:24:48,032
I'm sincerely sorry.

1015
01:24:48,052 --> 01:24:49,617
I'll go see.

1016
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:57,134
Let go!  She must read this letter!

1017
01:24:57,259 --> 01:24:58,500
What's going on?

1018
01:24:58,610 --> 01:25:01,044
Just pay us our fee!

1019
01:25:01,064 --> 01:25:03,498
We are here to collect for the jeweled branch that we made!

1020
01:25:03,632 --> 01:25:04,475
What's that?!

1021
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:06,700
The branch they made?

1022
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:13,800
I am Ayabe no Uchimaro, a craftsman belonging to the Guild of Artisans.

1023
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:19,740
At the order of Prince Kuramochi, we gathered together precious gems, mounted them...

1024
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:23,202
and put them together, as if it came from a jeweled tree on Mount Horai.

1025
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:24,662
Really?

1026
01:25:24,954 --> 01:25:28,165
However, the Prince has made no effort to pay us what we are owed!

1027
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,600
That's an outrage!

1028
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:33,400
 01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:31,585 And since Princess Kaguya, one of his concubines...

1029
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:37,300
sorry, one of his wives, was here, we decided to take action.

1030
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:42,600
Ill mannered as such a move may be, in the end we had no choice!

1031
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:47,400
Since the Prince has been avoiding us, it was our decision to try to collect our payment from her!

1032
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,085
That's why we have come to collect at  your residence!

1033
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:52,993
I understand.

1034
01:25:53,013 --> 01:25:53,848
I'll talk to him!

1035
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:56,329
So what's going...?

1036
01:25:56,349 --> 01:25:57,018
Woh!

1037
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:01,100
Where have you gone?!

1038
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,034
Where... where's the branch?

1039
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:08,200
Father, I'm afraid the Prince has taken his leave.

1040
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:09,200
He has?

1041
01:26:15,598 --> 01:26:18,060
We should at least reward the Artisans!

1042
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,542
They really did quite a nice job with that branch!

1043
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:33,564
Next to call at the mansion was Lord Abe, Minister of the Right.

1044
01:26:43,866 --> 01:26:45,409
Feast your eyes on this!

1045
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:48,370
It shimmers with an absolutely wonderous light!

1046
01:26:50,549 --> 01:26:53,553
It's extraordinary!

1047
01:26:53,573 --> 01:26:56,577
In all the world, there's never been an engagement gift as costly as the one I'm holding here!

1048
01:26:57,046 --> 01:27:00,841
However if it should please Princess Kaguya, the expence is really nothing!

1049
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:04,011
I'm your trifle to win  the heart of this lovely damsel.

1050
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:06,764
In that case then...

1051
01:27:06,889 --> 01:27:09,266
Oh, the Princess is close by!

1052
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:11,143
Drop it in the fire.

1053
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,102
Huh?

1054
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:14,772
Excuse me?

1055
01:27:16,065 --> 01:27:18,776
If it's truly made of fire-rat fur...

1056
01:27:19,235 --> 01:27:23,781
it will not burn but merely glisten...  all the brighter.

1057
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:25,616
Of course, Princess!

1058
01:27:25,751 --> 01:27:27,420
This fire-rat robe is no fake, it's genuine!

1059
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,109
Genuine!

1060
01:27:29,245 --> 01:27:31,956
If placed in the fire, it should not burn.

1061
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:35,793
But, I fear that... between the...

1062
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:39,100
Princess and myself, there remains an issue...

1063
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:41,440
A grain of unwarranted impurity.

1064
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,690
A question of my varasity on the subject!

1065
01:27:43,810 --> 01:27:45,125
Is that true?

1066
01:27:45,145 --> 01:27:46,460
It's very possible.

1067
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:49,640
All the more reason... to put it in the fire.

1068
01:27:49,775 --> 01:27:52,091
To burn all the impurity of my doubts.

1069
01:27:52,111 --> 01:27:54,427
Clean away!

1070
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,441
Yes, Your Highness!

1071
01:28:40,592 --> 01:28:41,460
Look!

1072
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,348
You see?

1073
01:28:42,484 --> 01:29:02,400
Ha-ha My entire fortune burning up in my hand!

1074
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:13,735
I've lost everything!

1075
01:29:13,755 --> 01:29:15,550
It's a complete disaster!

1076
01:29:24,193 --> 01:29:27,071
What a mad sum of money I've stuck into this robe!

1077
01:29:27,206 --> 01:29:28,708
Look at it now!

1078
01:29:28,728 --> 01:29:30,230
Look, look!

1079
01:29:30,366 --> 01:29:33,243
It is all beacause you told me to burn it!

1080
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:51,120
How much do you think the the Minister of the Right actually spent, to create that fake?

1081
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:54,640
I'm sure that's all I am to those gentlemen.

1082
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:55,440
What?

1083
01:29:55,557 --> 01:30:00,104
I'm a fake jeweled branch or a fire-rat fur robe that turns to ashes.

1084
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:05,109
Well both of them were very expensive it would seem.

1085
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,778
But have no fear, your suitors are trying.

1086
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:11,865
I'm told that Grand Counselor Otomo has gone by ship...

1087
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:16,537
He's traveling to Takoshi in a brave attempt to secure the stone from the dragon's neck.

1088
01:30:16,637 --> 01:30:17,146
What?

1089
01:30:17,246 --> 01:30:20,800
He is doing everything he can to bring you to him...

1090
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:27,798
It's quite a story, they say he has sent his wife far away and is in the process of completely rebuilding his mansion...

1091
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:32,302
A warrior's determination is a very powerful thing.

1092
01:30:36,942 --> 01:30:38,956
All right, Dragon!

1093
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,990
Arise and meet your fate!

1094
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:46,024
Watch out!

1095
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,550
The Dragon!

1096
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:14,390
Forgive me!

1097
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:16,090
Forgive me!

1098
01:31:32,196 --> 01:31:33,655
The dragon's everywhere!

1099
01:31:33,832 --> 01:31:35,606
Calm down!

1100
01:31:35,626 --> 01:31:37,400
The storm will pass.

1101
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:54,300
While the warrior faced his dragons, Prince Ishitsukuri was paying a call on Princess Kaguya.

1102
01:32:13,914 --> 01:32:15,442
What's this?

1103
01:32:15,462 --> 01:32:16,990
You found Buddha's begging bowl?

1104
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:18,875
This is extraordinary, Your Highness!

1105
01:32:18,895 --> 01:32:20,660
I don't know what to say!

1106
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,445
Give it to Princess Kaguya.

1107
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:25,123
So you brought something other than the bowl?

1108
01:32:25,249 --> 01:32:27,292
Please, just give it to her.

1109
01:32:27,417 --> 01:32:30,462
Well, alright...

1110
01:32:36,093 --> 01:32:40,806
Hey Princess, this is a gift from Prince Ishitsukuri.

1111
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:59,600
Since I first heard her voice three years ago...

1112
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:02,900
Princess Kaguya has not left my heart for even a moment...

1113
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:08,166
I set out on my quest desperately  searching for Buddha's begging bowl...

1114
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:13,400
Over meadow and mountain I walked, calling on temples throughout the land.

1115
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:18,844
Been weary to the point of exhaustion, I sat myself down by a stone on the road.

1116
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:25,684
Suddenly, my eye was taken by a beautiful wildflower  that was growing there at my feet.

1117
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,330
Ah!

1118
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:30,360
I was overwhelmed by my feelings.

1119
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,390
My love for the Princess spread within me...

1120
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,693
like the blooms on that exquiste flower.

1121
01:33:36,652 --> 01:33:42,800
And I had a moment of inspiration, It suddenly dawned on me, that what I  really wanted to bring the Princess...

1122
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:47,550
and what she had truly wished for, was not some distant unobtainable treasure...

1123
01:33:47,650 --> 01:33:52,044
but this simple flower, which itself is a treasure of nature.

1124
01:33:52,336 --> 01:33:59,551
This flower has come to represent for me, the devotion with which I love the Princess Devotion...

1125
01:34:00,687 --> 01:34:02,231
Princess Kaguya!

1126
01:34:02,251 --> 01:34:03,795
In truth you are to me...

1127
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:07,392
the only one whom I wish to dedicate my heart.

1128
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:11,897
Could you please perhaps, accept this lovely flower as a token...

1129
01:34:12,022 --> 01:34:14,232
of the depth of my feelings?

1130
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:20,405
Since I was a small boy, I have been fond of flowers and other plants.

1131
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:26,244
I am also entranced by the nameless flowers that grow by roadsides or in meadows.

1132
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,381
And in my heart...

1133
01:34:28,473 --> 01:34:34,877
I always wished that I could live, as do these flowers that bloom in the fields.

1134
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:45,263
Princess, I want you to come with me, to that place.

1135
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:49,643
Together we could leave this loud city and its formalities.

1136
01:34:50,237 --> 01:34:53,304
We could go to a rich green land where flowers bloom in perfusion.

1137
01:34:53,324 --> 01:34:56,391
Where birds sing and fish leap.

1138
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:58,700
A place brimming with life.

1139
01:34:59,079 --> 01:35:01,749
Let us laugh and sleep and sing.

1140
01:35:01,769 --> 01:35:04,439
Let us follow our hearts.

1141
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:08,620
Take pleasure in the tasks before us, with the blessings of the four seasons...

1142
01:35:08,755 --> 01:35:10,713
our needs will be supplied.

1143
01:35:10,733 --> 01:35:12,691
And we'll spin out a beautiful tale.

1144
01:35:13,417 --> 01:35:17,796
Please come with me to some place far away from here!

1145
01:35:18,255 --> 01:35:23,300
Where flowers bloom in perfusion, where fish leap and birds sing!

1146
01:35:23,410 --> 01:35:24,790
Come with me to that place!

1147
01:35:24,810 --> 01:35:26,190
Far away from here!

1148
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:28,072
Please!

1149
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:38,790
Excuse me!

1150
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:39,890
What's going on here?

1151
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:44,156
In a place far away from here, husband?

1152
01:35:44,458 --> 01:35:47,264
I would love to be taken there!

1153
01:35:47,284 --> 01:35:50,090
As I did when you said those very words, to me!

1154
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:51,329
I'm sorry!

1155
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:53,500
I beg for your forgivness!

1156
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,100
Would she have been just like all the others?

1157
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:05,700
Plucked from the field like a flower and then thrown away?

1158
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:13,500
How many more princesses would be forced to shave their heads, and go into a nunery?

1159
00:00:926,000 --> 01:36:18,857
 01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:12,684 01:36:17,063 --> 01:36:18,857 926   I got it!

1160
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,526
Get me down!

1161
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:22,500
All that remained...

1162
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:28,700
was Middle Counselor Isonokami, who was in search of the mysterious cowry shell amulet.

1163
01:36:31,671 --> 01:36:32,318
Counselor!

1164
01:36:32,338 --> 01:36:32,985
Counselor!

1165
01:36:33,996 --> 01:36:34,996
Is he alright?

1166
01:36:41,671 --> 01:36:43,089
The Counselor is dead?

1167
01:36:43,215 --> 01:36:44,049
Yes.

1168
01:36:44,184 --> 01:36:46,502
A great tragedy.

1169
01:36:46,522 --> 01:36:48,840
His back was broken... reaching for the nest.

1170
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,831
Goodness, what's the matter?

1171
01:37:16,873 --> 01:37:20,500
This garden, it's... it's a fake!

1172
01:37:21,837 --> 01:37:22,629
Fake!

1173
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,422
Fake!

1174
01:37:24,673 --> 01:37:25,400
Fake!

1175
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:26,500
Fake!

1176
01:37:27,727 --> 01:37:29,335
It's all fake!

1177
01:37:29,355 --> 01:37:30,963
And so am I!

1178
01:37:30,983 --> 01:37:32,591
So am I!

1179
00:00:943,000 --> 01:37:33,807
 01:37:29,553 --> 01:37:32,430 01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:33,807 943   Stop it.

1180
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:46,000
Everyone's miserable and it's all my fault.

1181
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:47,495
It's not your fault.

1182
01:37:47,515 --> 01:37:48,800
It's not!

1183
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:50,105
You mustn't blame yourself.

1184
01:37:50,709 --> 01:37:52,239
It is my fault.

1185
01:37:52,259 --> 01:37:53,789
All of it, is my fault!

1186
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:56,000
Because I'm a fake!

1187
01:37:56,510 --> 01:37:57,790
I never wanted it to happen like this!

1188
01:37:57,810 --> 01:37:59,090
My love!

1189
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:02,627
I didn't ask for this!

1190
01:38:02,752 --> 01:38:03,950
That may be true.

1191
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:07,632
But it still doesn't make it your fault.

1192
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,600
But in spite of her wishes, there was even more talk of the Princess...

1193
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:27,800
and in time, His Majesty himself began to show interest.

1194
01:38:30,957 --> 01:38:34,414
She has led five of the highest nobles of the land,  around... by their nose!

1195
01:38:34,434 --> 01:38:37,891
Interesting!

1196
00:00:956,000 --> 01:38:46,200
 01:38:35,255 --> 01:38:36,536 01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:46,200 956   If she has so stubbornly refused all these men, it must be the wish of this Princess Kaguya... to come to me.

1197
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:48,440
Let's play her game.

1198
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:50,590
Send word she is to appear before me!

1199
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:51,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

1200
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:58,892
Her father has most certainly raised her well... so when she becomes mine, give her father the rank of Court Official!

1201
01:38:59,309 --> 01:39:00,900
As your Majesty wishes.

1202
01:39:01,610 --> 01:39:02,509
Wonderful!

1203
01:39:02,529 --> 01:39:03,428
It's wonderful.

1204
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:05,040
Princess!

1205
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:05,890
Princess!

1206
01:39:06,010 --> 01:39:06,940
Husband!

1207
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:07,890
Calm down, please!

1208
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,027
Princess!

1209
01:39:11,831 --> 01:39:13,417
Your Highness!

1210
01:39:13,437 --> 01:39:15,023
I have joyous news!

1211
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:20,205
You've now come to the attention of His Majesty, who is summoning you to serve in his court!

1212
01:39:20,305 --> 01:39:20,895
What?

1213
01:39:21,007 --> 01:39:22,509
It's extraordinary!

1214
01:39:22,529 --> 01:39:24,031
You'll be one of His Majesty's wives.

1215
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:26,800
Not only that, I will wear the hat of a court official!

1216
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:28,040
Ah!

1217
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:29,190
This is wonderful!

1218
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:30,840
Listen to you!

1219
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:32,390
You still don't comprehend how your daughter feels?

1220
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,344
It is you, who doesn't understand!

1221
01:39:34,511 --> 01:39:37,138
All that we have done has been for the sake of this!

1222
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:39,057
For a girl born in this land...

1223
01:39:39,192 --> 01:39:41,481
there is no greater happiness than joining His Majesty in holy wedlock!

1224
01:39:41,501 --> 01:39:43,790
None!

1225
01:39:44,104 --> 01:39:47,900
Now at last, after all this effort, Her Highness will finally be happy!

1226
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,450
Father...

1227
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:52,737
I'm sorry, but please refuse.

1228
01:39:52,837 --> 01:39:53,437
What?

1229
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:55,907
I couldn't possibly be a court lady now.

1230
01:39:56,543 --> 01:39:58,463
What are you talking about?

1231
01:39:58,483 --> 01:40:00,403
You're refusing to serve at court?

1232
01:40:00,537 --> 01:40:02,247
Father, my answer is no!

1233
01:40:03,206 --> 01:40:04,582
But, you can't...

1234
01:40:04,759 --> 01:40:07,075
No one in this land is allowed to disobey an order from His Majesty!

1235
01:40:07,095 --> 01:40:09,411
In the slightest degree!

1236
01:40:09,546 --> 01:40:12,632
So quit thinking of just yourself, please!

1237
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:18,288
Father...

1238
01:40:18,308 --> 01:40:22,086
If disobedience to His Majesty  is considered a crime punishable by death...

1239
01:40:23,226 --> 01:40:26,730
well then... the only choice is to kill me!

1240
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:28,106
Princess!

1241
01:40:30,231 --> 01:40:34,946
Poppa, if your happiness depends on wearing the cap of a court official...

1242
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:38,450
then I will go to His Majesty as you wish.

1243
01:40:39,252 --> 01:40:41,755
And after you have put on that cap as part of the court...

1244
01:40:41,775 --> 01:40:44,278
I will kill myself.

1245
01:40:58,063 --> 01:40:59,670
What?

1246
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:01,297
She refused?

1247
01:41:01,765 --> 01:41:03,475
What is the meaning of this?

1248
01:41:03,735 --> 01:41:05,988
She has turned down an offer to live at the palace?

1249
01:41:06,008 --> 01:41:08,261
No woman has ever turned me down before!

1250
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:12,453
Very interesting!

1251
01:41:12,473 --> 01:41:14,476
Now I truly want to meet her all the more!

1252
01:41:15,121 --> 01:41:17,854
Alright!

1253
01:41:17,874 --> 01:41:20,607
If she is determined to play that game,  I will grace her mansion with a surprise visit.

1254
01:41:21,618 --> 01:41:22,994
Yes, Your Majesty.

1255
01:41:40,136 --> 01:41:42,780
This way, your Majesty.

1256
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:49,270
She plays the koto beautifully!

1257
01:42:10,834 --> 01:42:13,044
Her face is most angelic!

1258
01:42:25,348 --> 01:42:29,060
Now, let's waste no more time with games!

1259
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:31,271
Why are you doing this?

1260
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:33,700
Why, to make you happy of course!

1261
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:35,500
My embrace pleases all women!

1262
01:42:35,610 --> 01:42:36,827
Let me go!

1263
01:42:36,847 --> 01:42:38,064
I will never be yours!

1264
01:42:38,174 --> 01:42:40,074
I'm afraid that's not an acceptable answer!

1265
01:42:40,174 --> 01:42:42,884
If I wish you to come, they you must obey!

1266
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:46,077
Bring around the carriage quickly!

1267
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,400
Where is she?

1268
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:02,427
Where did she go?

1269
01:43:22,415 --> 01:43:25,168
I see that I acted in haste.

1270
01:43:25,188 --> 01:43:27,941
So please, show yourself, you have nothing to fear.

1271
01:43:29,245 --> 01:43:30,288
Please, Princess.

1272
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:34,959
I will simply burn the sight of you into my eyes, and then withdraw.

1273
01:43:44,928 --> 01:43:46,804
How beautiful you are!

1274
01:43:49,933 --> 01:43:51,601
Remember your promise.

1275
01:43:56,773 --> 01:43:58,650
I will withdraw for today.

1276
01:43:58,942 --> 01:44:05,323
However I believe your ultimate happiness lies in you, becoming mine.

1277
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:09,827
Such beauty I've never seen!

1278
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:41,234
After His Majesty returned to his palace...

1279
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:46,197
Princess Kaguya, would come out to the pavillion every night...

1280
01:44:46,322 --> 01:44:49,367
to gaze at the moon.

1281
01:45:10,013 --> 01:45:11,800
What's the matter, Princess?

1282
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:15,000
Lately you never come in to see me.

1283
01:45:16,853 --> 01:45:22,233
You've left your spinning to sit, and you haven't tended to your plants for days.

1284
01:45:22,535 --> 01:45:24,253
You now spend most of your nights gazing at the moon.

1285
01:45:24,273 --> 01:45:25,991
I don't understand...

1286
01:45:26,110 --> 01:45:27,243
What is it?

1287
01:45:27,263 --> 01:45:28,396
What's happening with you?

1288
01:45:28,698 --> 01:45:30,074
Nothing has happened.

1289
01:45:30,209 --> 01:45:31,628
That's not true.

1290
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:33,067
Now c'mon, tell me.

1291
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:36,581
It's obvious from far away look in your eyes.

1292
01:45:37,373 --> 01:45:39,709
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong.

1293
01:45:39,876 --> 01:45:41,753
But... but...

1294
01:45:49,177 --> 01:45:52,263
Is it something you can't tell even me?

1295
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:01,440
They're coming to take me back!

1296
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:03,390
To the Moon!

1297
01:46:04,901 --> 01:46:06,110
The Moon?

1298
01:46:07,235 --> 01:46:11,500
Every night I've begged them to let me stay!

1299
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,200
With you!

1300
01:46:14,087 --> 01:46:16,131
But it's no use!

1301
01:46:16,151 --> 01:46:18,195
They're coming for me on the 15th day!

1302
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:19,957
Who's coming?

1303
01:46:21,427 --> 01:46:23,013
What's this about Princess?

1304
01:46:23,033 --> 01:46:24,619
I'm very confused.

1305
01:46:24,729 --> 01:46:26,964
 01:46:24,729 --> 01:46:25,229 You have to help me here...

1306
01:46:27,298 --> 01:46:31,803
Try to explain this in simple words so an old man like me will understand, Your Highness...

1307
01:46:33,231 --> 01:46:34,629
Oh!

1308
01:46:34,649 --> 01:46:36,047
You poor thing!

1309
01:46:36,067 --> 01:46:37,465
There is something very deep behind this, isn't there?

1310
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:55,100
The truth is... the day you found me, I was was sent here from the Moon.

1311
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,661
From the Moon?

1312
01:46:58,855 --> 01:47:01,666
The Moon put you in the bamboo?

1313
01:47:01,791 --> 01:47:02,834
Yes.

1314
01:47:04,043 --> 01:47:08,840
I understood it, on the day His Majesty was here.

1315
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:15,513
And now on the 15th day, the people of the Moon will come for me...

1316
01:47:16,097 --> 01:47:18,057
and I must leave you both forever.

1317
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:19,790
What?

1318
01:47:19,810 --> 01:47:21,290
I don't understand!

1319
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:22,790
You planning to leave us?

1320
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:26,357
Just... what is it we have done to deserve this?

1321
01:47:26,816 --> 01:47:31,487
I mean, from the start all we ever tried to do  was make sure you were always happy!

1322
01:47:32,321 --> 01:47:37,493
All this happiness that you wished for me has been very hard to bear.

1323
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:40,496
Without realizing it...

1324
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:43,541
I prayed for someone to save me.

1325
01:47:44,167 --> 01:47:48,880
And when His Majesty grabbed me, in panic my heart just screamed out...

1326
01:47:49,338 --> 01:47:52,049
I don't want to be here anymore!

1327
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:58,055
You mean, you asked them to come here and take you back to the Moon?

1328
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:01,726
That's just terrible!

1329
01:48:01,851 --> 01:48:04,520
What have you done?

1330
01:48:04,739 --> 01:48:06,324
I don't want to go back, Poppa.

1331
01:48:06,344 --> 01:48:07,929
I wanna stay here!

1332
01:48:08,075 --> 01:48:08,973
I won't let it happen!

1333
01:48:08,993 --> 01:48:09,891
We'll fight to keep you!

1334
01:48:10,026 --> 01:48:13,571
We'll figure something out, I just won't let them pass!

1335
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:15,406
It's too late!

1336
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,576
They are coming!

1337
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:23,700
What have I been doing here in this land?

1338
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:27,400
Throwing tantrums because I didn't want to  belong to anyone...

1339
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:34,900
Ignoring what you want from me, and fooling myself with tiny fake meadows and mountains!

1340
01:48:31,714 --> 01:48:45,770
 01:48:31,714 --> 01:48:35,052 Only now, when I'm forced to go back to the Moon, do i finally remember...

1341
01:48:47,605 --> 01:48:53,600
why I came here, and why it is, no matter what is happening...

1342
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:58,852
in this strange land, that song has always been inside my heart.

1343
01:49:02,578 --> 01:49:11,963
* Birds, bugs, beasts * * Grass, flowers and trees * Yes, that's the song.

1344
01:49:12,473 --> 01:49:14,622
I was...

1345
01:49:14,642 --> 01:49:16,791
I was born to live here!

1346
01:49:16,811 --> 01:49:18,960
With the birds, bugs and beasts.

1347
01:49:23,933 --> 01:49:25,643
I don't want to leave!

1348
01:49:26,404 --> 01:49:28,136
And you won't!

1349
01:49:28,156 --> 01:49:29,888
I will never let you go!

1350
01:49:30,273 --> 01:49:34,819
From the day I found you in the bamboo and held you so gently in my arms...

1351
01:49:35,278 --> 01:49:39,600
I've just loved you as if you were my very own child!

1352
01:49:41,450 --> 01:49:47,331
And when I picked you up and cradled you, put you on your feet and changed clothes...

1353
01:49:47,623 --> 01:49:51,502
I was the happiest man on the face of the Earth, like I was in Heaven!

1354
01:49:57,476 --> 01:49:58,561
It's not too late to save you!

1355
01:49:58,581 --> 01:49:59,666
It's not!

1356
01:49:59,812 --> 01:50:00,835
You're here!

1357
01:50:00,855 --> 01:50:01,878
We still have you!

1358
01:50:01,898 --> 01:50:02,921
You're still here in my arms!

1359
01:50:03,055 --> 01:50:06,300
And these arms of mine, will drive them away!

1360
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:08,976
I will not let them take you!

1361
01:50:08,996 --> 01:50:11,162
No matter how many of them come!

1362
01:50:11,182 --> 01:50:13,348
I'll fight them off!

1363
01:50:14,150 --> 01:50:15,693
Is everyone?!

1364
01:50:16,152 --> 01:50:18,113
Prepare to defend the princess!

1365
01:50:22,501 --> 01:50:23,920
Oh Poppa!

1366
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:25,359
I'm sorry.

1367
01:50:37,308 --> 01:50:38,560
My Heavens!

1368
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:39,832
What a lot of noise they're making!

1369
01:50:43,137 --> 01:50:45,681
How about a song to make us feel better?

1370
01:50:55,284 --> 01:51:27,602
* Go round, go round * * Waterwheel, go round * * Go round, and call Mr.

1371
01:51:27,622 --> 01:51:59,940
Sun * * Birds, bugs, beasts * * Grass, flowers and trees * * Spring, summer, autumn, winter * * Bring 'em all on * * Go round, go round * * Waterwheel go round * * Go round and call Mr.

1372
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:32,278
Sun * * Spring, summer, autumn, winter * * Bring 'em all on * * Spring, summer, autumn, winter * * Bring 'em all on * * Go round, come round * * Distant time * * Come round, Oh distant time * * Come round, call back the heart * * Come round, call back the heart * * Birds, bugs, beasts * * Grass, flowers and trees * * Teach people how to feel * * If I hear that you pine for me * * I will want to return to you * * I will want to return to you *  I wasn't aware there was another verse.

1373
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:34,290
I remember...

1374
01:52:34,415 --> 01:52:40,129
Long ago in the City of the Moon, a woman who had just returned from Earth, would sing this song.

1375
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:47,136
When you put on the robe of the Moon, all memories of the Earth just disappear.

1376
01:52:47,428 --> 01:52:49,805
All grief and sadness are gone.

1377
01:52:50,765 --> 01:52:55,712
But when she sang that song, I saw tears fall from her eyes.

1378
01:52:59,617 --> 01:53:02,370
It was such a mystery to me.

1379
01:53:02,390 --> 01:53:05,143
I had to know what those feelings from Earth were?

1380
01:53:07,614 --> 01:53:10,659
That's why I broke the rules to come to this place.

1381
01:53:11,744 --> 01:53:14,997
I wanted to feel all the same things that she felt, and now...

1382
01:53:15,289 --> 01:53:18,793
I know exactly what she was feeling as she looked back at this land.

1383
01:53:19,543 --> 01:53:20,669
Tell me dear...

1384
01:53:21,462 --> 01:53:23,005
She wanted...

1385
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:25,577
to come back here.

1386
01:53:25,597 --> 01:53:28,034
To feel all those wonderful, mysterious things again!

1387
01:53:28,054 --> 01:53:30,491
I know it!

1388
00:00:1123,000 --> 01:53:35,684
 01:53:29,278 --> 01:53:30,378 01:53:31,108 --> 01:53:35,684 1123   If I hear that you pine for me, I will want to return to you.

1389
01:53:36,977 --> 01:53:40,314
If you are waiting for me, I will return to you...

1390
01:53:40,406 --> 01:53:43,859
come round and call back my heart.

1391
01:53:43,999 --> 01:53:48,197
I just... wanna go home!

1392
01:53:54,004 --> 01:53:55,903
Prepare a carriage quickly.

1393
01:53:55,923 --> 01:53:57,822
Don't bring the word to anyone.

1394
01:54:46,964 --> 01:54:48,757
Ginger flowers!

1395
01:55:15,576 --> 01:55:17,620
It's been a long time.

1396
01:55:18,710 --> 01:55:19,840
What's the matter?

1397
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:20,990
Hungry again?

1398
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:22,100
Mama!

1399
01:55:29,256 --> 01:55:30,799
Did anybody hear that?

1400
01:55:32,426 --> 01:55:33,677
Hear what?

1401
01:55:34,261 --> 01:55:35,638
I'll go look.

1402
01:55:57,284 --> 01:55:59,161
Sutemaru, it's you!

1403
01:55:59,453 --> 01:56:00,287
It's you!

1404
01:56:00,621 --> 01:56:01,997
Little Bamboo?

1405
01:56:02,456 --> 01:56:03,999
Is it okay if call you that?

1406
01:56:09,797 --> 01:56:12,000
We were just coming back here for the new trees.

1407
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:16,178
And for some reason coming over the pass, I thought I heard your voice, singing.

1408
01:56:16,303 --> 01:56:18,180
I'm so happy to see you!

1409
01:56:20,307 --> 01:56:22,184
Yeah.

1410
01:56:23,988 --> 01:56:25,406
Tell me?

1411
01:56:25,426 --> 01:56:26,844
What are you doing here, dressed like that?

1412
01:56:26,981 --> 01:56:30,025
All this time I've wanted to come back to my real home.

1413
01:56:30,985 --> 01:56:32,695
Your real home?

1414
01:56:33,821 --> 01:56:34,738
Here?

1415
01:56:34,863 --> 01:56:36,031
Uh-hmm.

1416
01:56:37,825 --> 01:56:40,077
But weren't you happy in the capital?

1417
01:56:41,537 --> 01:56:46,875
Living in a mansion, eating fine food, wearing nice clothes...

1418
01:56:47,001 --> 01:56:51,588
All that time I was wishing I was here on the mountain, playing with everyone.

1419
01:56:51,714 --> 01:56:54,466
Well, everyone's gonna be here soon.

1420
01:56:54,675 --> 01:56:56,885
And with you, Sutemaru...

1421
01:57:00,848 --> 01:57:05,853
With you, Sutemaru, I know I would have been truly happy.

1422
01:57:07,104 --> 01:57:08,647
Happy, with me?

1423
01:57:09,356 --> 01:57:11,233
Now I realize that.

1424
01:57:13,193 --> 01:57:14,236
You're joking, right!

1425
01:57:15,372 --> 01:57:16,707
I don't think you'd feel that way.

1426
01:57:16,727 --> 01:57:18,062
You, living like us!

1427
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:19,961
Sure I would!

1428
01:57:19,981 --> 01:57:21,734
I did live like you when we were kids!

1429
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,400
In rags like these?

1430
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,500
Half-starving, eating roots?

1431
01:57:38,177 --> 01:57:40,763
Sometimes stealing dinner because you hadn't eaten in days?

1432
01:57:40,900 --> 01:57:42,300
I saw that!

1433
01:57:44,391 --> 01:57:47,102
I also saw when they beat you up.

1434
01:57:47,237 --> 01:57:47,947
Oh that?

1435
01:57:47,967 --> 01:57:48,677
That was nothing.

1436
01:57:48,864 --> 01:57:51,138
It's nothing if you answer back!

1437
01:57:51,158 --> 01:57:53,432
Answer back by simply being alive!

1438
01:57:56,236 --> 01:57:58,781
I just know, I would have been happy.

1439
01:58:03,744 --> 01:58:04,953
Little Bamboo!

1440
01:58:06,747 --> 01:58:08,207
But it won't happen.

1441
01:58:09,124 --> 01:58:10,626
It's too late.

1442
01:58:10,876 --> 01:58:12,200
What do you mean?

1443
01:58:13,710 --> 01:58:15,573
Ah!

1444
01:58:15,593 --> 01:58:17,456
You are promised to His Majesty?  No!

1445
01:58:17,716 --> 01:58:19,384
I won't belong to anyone!

1446
01:58:19,510 --> 01:58:20,302
Let's run away!

1447
01:58:20,469 --> 01:58:21,303
It can't happen.

1448
01:58:21,438 --> 01:58:22,440
Why not?

1449
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:23,462
We can leave right now!

1450
01:58:25,432 --> 01:58:26,642
Let's run.

1451
01:58:26,767 --> 01:58:28,000
Come with me, and we'll go!

1452
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:30,400
I'll carry you on my back and run forever!

1453
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:33,649
We'll go some place where nobody can ever find us!

1454
01:58:34,451 --> 01:58:35,703
I can't run away.

1455
01:58:35,723 --> 01:58:36,975
Not any more.

1456
01:58:37,277 --> 01:58:38,737
Of course you can, Little Bamboo!

1457
01:58:39,039 --> 01:58:40,249
I'll protect you!

1458
01:58:40,269 --> 01:58:41,479
I'll protect you from everyone!

1459
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:43,492
But they're coming for me.

1460
01:58:43,784 --> 01:58:45,327
Who's coming for you?

1461
01:58:46,286 --> 01:58:47,830
I've been found.

1462
01:58:49,610 --> 01:58:50,640
So what?

1463
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:51,690
Even if you have been found!

1464
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:53,600
So what!

1465
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:55,050
I don't care about that!

1466
01:58:55,150 --> 01:58:56,588
I wanna run away with you.

1467
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:01,500
Please!

1468
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:04,721
Sutemaru!

1469
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:07,224
Yes!

1470
01:59:10,821 --> 01:59:12,156
I'll run, too!

1471
01:59:12,176 --> 01:59:13,511
As fast as I can!

1472
01:59:35,002 --> 01:59:36,378
Little Bamboo!

1473
01:59:36,837 --> 01:59:37,713
Little Bamboo!

1474
01:59:37,838 --> 01:59:39,381
Sutemaru!

1475
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:09,000
Oh Heaven, oh Earth!

1476
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:11,300
Take me in!

1477
02:01:32,210 --> 02:01:33,590
Huh?

1478
02:01:33,610 --> 02:01:34,990
No!

1479
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:40,000
Please let me stay, just a little longer!

1480
02:01:40,110 --> 02:01:43,127
To feel the joy and happiness of living on this Earth!

1481
02:01:43,147 --> 02:01:46,164
Please don't take me away!

1482
02:01:46,383 --> 02:01:47,676
It's alright Little Bamboo.

1483
02:01:47,811 --> 02:01:48,646
I'll hold you tight!

1484
02:01:48,666 --> 02:01:49,501
I won't ever let go!

1485
02:01:49,771 --> 02:01:51,295
Hold me tighter!

1486
02:01:51,315 --> 02:01:52,839
I don't wanna go!

1487
02:01:56,900 --> 02:01:58,200
Little Bamboo!

1488
02:01:58,900 --> 02:02:00,200
Little Bamboo!

1489
02:02:18,665 --> 02:02:20,042
Little Bamboo!

1490
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:22,711
Little Bamboo!

1491
02:02:25,339 --> 02:02:26,548
A dream?

1492
02:02:30,677 --> 02:02:32,220
It wasn't real?

1493
02:02:34,848 --> 02:02:36,725
Dada!

1494
02:02:38,410 --> 02:02:39,590
Dada!

1495
02:02:39,610 --> 02:02:40,790
Hi...

1496
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:56,400
Dada!

1497
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:17,600
And then at last, the 15th day of August came round.

1498
02:04:03,603 --> 02:04:04,771
Fire!

1499
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:39,200
Princess!

1500
00:00:1218,000 --> 02:04:47,000
 02:04:40,599 --> 02:04:41,808 02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000 1218   Princess!

1501
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:20,100
Princess...

1502
02:06:23,510 --> 02:06:32,990
* Go round, go round * * Waterwheel go round * * Go round, and call Mr.

1503
02:06:33,010 --> 02:06:42,490
Sun * * Birds, bugs, beasts * * Grass, flowers and trees * * Flower, bear fruit * * bear fruit, and die * * Be born, grow up, and die * * Still the wind blows, and the rain falls * * The waterwheel goes round * My little girl!

1504
02:06:42,510 --> 02:06:51,990
My Princess!

1505
02:06:54,710 --> 02:06:56,290
Please!

1506
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:57,890
No... no!

1507
02:06:59,497 --> 02:07:01,483
* Lifetimes come and go in turn * Princess!

1508
02:07:01,503 --> 02:07:03,489
Princess!

1509
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:07,621
* Over and over a life revives * Princess!

1510
00:20:31,010 --> 01:13:56,474
 02:07:08,580 --> 02:07:09,956 02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:17,000 1231   * Over and over a life renews * Princess!

1511
01:13:56,494 --> 02:07:21,958
Don't leave us!

1512
02:07:22,427 --> 02:07:23,637
Not yet!

1513
02:07:24,262 --> 02:07:25,639
Please, not yet.

1514
02:07:26,931 --> 02:07:28,933
Once I dawn this robe...

1515
02:07:29,267 --> 02:07:32,979
I will forget everything I know and love about this land.

1516
02:07:33,355 --> 02:07:35,900
So please just for a moment.

1517
02:07:38,286 --> 02:07:39,078
Princess!

1518
02:07:39,098 --> 02:07:39,890
Daughter!

1519
02:07:48,453 --> 02:07:49,496
Please!

1520
02:07:49,631 --> 02:07:51,397
Take us with you!

1521
02:07:51,417 --> 02:07:53,183
Take us with you!

1522
02:07:53,301 --> 02:07:55,035
Forgive me, Momma and Poppa!

1523
02:07:55,055 --> 02:07:56,789
Please forgive me!

1524
02:07:57,128 --> 02:07:59,172
Now now, let us go.

1525
02:07:59,297 --> 02:08:02,342
This heavy heart will no longer trouble you in the City of the Moon...

1526
02:08:02,467 --> 02:08:07,347
And the memory of this impure Earth, will lift from your mind forever.

1527
02:08:07,472 --> 02:08:08,848
It's not impure!

1528
02:08:11,810 --> 02:08:14,900
There is grief and sorrow here...

1529
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:17,500
There is also joy and happiness!

1530
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:22,000
All who live on this earth, experience them in different shades.

1531
02:08:20,485 --> 02:08:24,197
 02:08:20,485 --> 02:08:22,028 All feel compassion.

1532
02:08:27,409 --> 02:08:28,702
Princess!

1533
02:08:44,700 --> 02:08:46,200
Princess!

1534
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:06,600
Princess!

1535
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:34,500
Voices: Chlo
