Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DYMP, Walt Disney Japan, Mitsubishi, Toho and KDDI present THE TALE OF THE PRINCESS KAGUYA Executive Producer Seiichiro Ujiie Based on the Japanese Folktale "The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter" Original Concept by Isao Takahata Screenplay by Isao Takahata and Riko Sakaguchi Joe Hisaishi Music Theme Song Kazumi Nikaido Character Design and Directing Animator Osamu Tanabe Art Director Kazuo Oga Planning Toshio Suzuki Producer Yoshiaki Nishimura Directed by Isao Takahata Once upon a time there lived a bamboo cutter.

2
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:22,541
On the mountain he would cut bamboo to make all manner of things.

3
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:29,215
Sanuki no Miyatsuko was his name.

4
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:37,765
One day he saw light shining from a bamboo stalk.

5
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,649
In wonder, he drew closer.

6
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:57,034
A bamboo shoot growing before the plums flower?

7
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,001
What's this?!

8
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:28,858
Um...

9
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:33,195
... may I ask who you might be?

10
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,104
What a beautiful princess!

11
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:12,526
Heaven must have sent her to me as a blessing.

12
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,955
Did you catch something?

13
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,758
What a pretty doll!

14
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,135
No, she's sleeping.

15
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,804
What?!

16
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,936
I've been blessed.

17
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,187
"Blessed"?

18
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,523
By Heaven, in the grove!

19
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,237
It's me Heaven's blessed.

20
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:40,239
I'm the one who'll raise her.

21
00:04:40,374 --> 00:04:42,251
"Raise her"?

22
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:44,148
She's already a beautiful princess.

23
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:47,204
There'll be more to this than you think.

24
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:48,747
Right?

25
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,088
Give her here!

26
00:05:11,655 --> 00:05:13,429
Don't just sit there!

27
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:15,223
Bring me a cloth.

28
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,029
How's this?

29
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,035
There, there!

30
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,537
What's going on?

31
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,999
She wants me to raise her.

32
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,588
Get me a nice basket.

33
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:42,009
This is very strange, you know.

34
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,677
What if she's some kind of spirit?

35
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,637
What does she look like?

36
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,431
A baby.

37
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,390
Right!

38
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,851
But just now she was a princess!

39
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:57,024
That was Heaven telling us who she'll grow into.

40
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:57,983
Really?

41
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,904
So that means we must raise her properly.

42
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,041
Yes!

43
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:04,063
That must be it.

44
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,449
Yes.

45
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,826
I see!

46
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,787
But who'll nurse her?

47
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,747
A wet nurse.

48
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,042
And the lathe-turners have a new baby.

49
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,168
So this is...

50
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,379
A gift.

51
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,340
What's the matter?

52
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,732
What are you doing?!

53
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:42,643
There, there!

54
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:44,270
You must be hungry.

55
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:45,781
What?!

56
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,159
She's drinking it right down.

57
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,622
I've got milk!

58
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,817
She laughed!

59
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,153
She did!

60
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,406
Suddenly she feels heavier.

61
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,116
That can't be!

62
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,550
Now what?

63
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,801
She's heavier still!

64
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,845
Let me see.

65
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,599
She's growing really fast.

66
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,660
Plum blossoms already!

67
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,464
She just got heavier again!

68
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,049
You see?

69
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,885
Well, I'll be!

70
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:36,433
From that day on the Bamboo Cutter and his wife...

71
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,895
... would raise this miraculous child as their very own.

72
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:42,448
No!

73
00:09:42,468 --> 00:09:44,242
You can't have those yet.

74
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,176
There's a baby!

75
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:54,439
Yeah?

76
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,586
Where?

77
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,015
Don't push!

78
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,516
There!

79
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,663
She looked at us!

80
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,456
Yeah!

81
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:23,832
No.

82
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,268
What is it?

83
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,327
Oh, my!

84
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,578
Well, I'll be!

85
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,475
Princess!

86
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,357
She's standing!

87
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,778
She's walking!

88
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,370
Oh, my!

89
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,261
There, there...

90
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,304
She's funny!

91
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,514
She walked.

92
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,765
She was just crawling.

93
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,434
She's growing fast!

94
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,061
Like a bamboo shoot!

95
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:09,052
That's her!

96
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:09,928
Li'l Bamboo!

97
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,106
Li'l Bamboo!

98
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,441
Li'l Bamboo!

99
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,109
Li'l Bamboo!

100
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,277
Li'l Bamboo!

101
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:17,164
She's not "Li'l Bamboo"!

102
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:18,936
She's "Princess"!

103
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,782
Li'l Bamboo!

104
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,909
Li'l Bamboo!

105
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,786
Li'l Bamboo!

106
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,674
Princess!

107
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,926
Come to me!

108
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,304
Princess!

109
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,643
Li'l Bamboo!

110
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,020
Li'l Bamboo!

111
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,314
Princess!

112
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,316
Come to me!

113
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,401
Li'l Bamboo!

114
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,278
Li'l Bamboo!

115
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,822
Princess!

116
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,241
Princess!

117
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:06,902
Princess!

118
00:13:06,922 --> 00:13:07,611
Come to me!

119
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:08,695
Princess!

120
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:09,487
Come to me!

121
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,707
Princess!

122
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,210
Come to me!

123
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,878
Do you want to come?

124
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:18,097
Bamboo shoots.

125
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:19,139
That's supper.

126
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:21,060
Supper!

127
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,854
Bamboo shoots!

128
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,700
Right!

129
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,827
Stand back.

130
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,460
There's lots!

131
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,129
Yeah!

132
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,494
Come here!

133
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,610
You don't mess with a wild pig!

134
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,072
Huh?

135
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,294
You're a strange kid.

136
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:51,983
You just got bigger.

137
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,163
She's weird, Sutemaru.

138
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,166
She's gotten bigger again!

139
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,669
Like a bamboo shoot.

140
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:01,920
A bamboo shoot?

141
00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:02,849
Bamboo shoot!

142
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:03,663
Supper!

143
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,007
Bamboo shoot!

144
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,009
Li'l Bamboo!

145
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:45,505
Round, round, go round Waterwheel, go round Go round, and call Mr Sun Go round, and call Mr Sun Birds, bugs, beasts Grass, trees, flowers Bring spring and summer, fall and winter Bring spring and summer, fall and winter Birds!

146
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,589
Bugs!

147
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,341
Beasts!

148
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,509
Grass!

149
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:50,385
Trees!

150
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,636
Flowers!

151
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,056
Huh?

152
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,142
Do you know this song?

153
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,518
Yes!

154
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:54,574
Go round, come round, come round Come round, O distant time Come round, call back my heart Come round, call back my heart Birds, bugs, beasts Grass, trees, flowers Teach me how to feel If I hear that you pine for me I will return to you That's a weird song.

155
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,367
She's crying!

156
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,702
Yeah!

157
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,163
What's wrong?

158
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,083
I don't know.

159
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,293
She's weird!

160
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,964
We live over there.

161
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,425
That's your bamboo grove.

162
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,680
Bamboo shoots!

163
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:20,975
Let's go!

164
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,108
Princess!

165
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,692
Princess!

166
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,779
Where are you?!

167
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:34,666
Princess!

168
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:36,188
Princess!

169
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,506
What's that?

170
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,655
Could this be...?

171
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,325
See you later!

172
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,076
Be careful!

173
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:07,457
Should we be letting her play with those boys?

174
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,210
She's fine with them.

175
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:14,422
It's just that up in the grove I found...

176
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,184
No.

177
00:20:16,204 --> 00:20:17,539
It's nothing.

178
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:30,783
That's lacquer.

179
00:20:30,803 --> 00:20:31,805
You'll get a rash!

180
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,274
"Lacquer"?

181
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,156
That smells good!

182
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,909
We'll make bowls from them.

183
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,327
From these?

184
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,749
Wow!

185
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,919
That's my dad, my elder brother, and my mom.

186
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,309
Goodbye!

187
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,730
Bring us something back!

188
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,941
The Bamboo Cutter's girl.

189
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:17,986
"Li'l Bamboo".

190
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:28,079
Come on, Li'l Bamboo!

191
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,683
It's so hot!

192
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,185
I'm thirsty.

193
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,453
I'll bet those are good.

194
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:09,912
Yeah?

195
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,914
Don't!

196
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,551
Come on!

197
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,012
Someone's coming!

198
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,277
Leave it!

199
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,428
This is for the others.

200
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,988
This is good!

201
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,823
This is good!

202
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:46,819
When these beautiful clothes came flying up, I knew...

203
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,155
... what Heaven wants.

204
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,866
What Heaven wants?

205
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:58,456
It wants us to give her a life that suits these robes.

206
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,042
To make her a noble princess.

207
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,836
A noble princess?

208
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,426
With this gold, I'll build her a fine mansion in the capital.

209
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,226
Take her there?

210
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,185
Yes.

211
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,396
Out here she'll always be just a country girl.

212
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:28,194
Living with nobles as a real princess...

213
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,238
... she'll be happy.

214
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:33,950
In any case, that is Heaven's wish.

215
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,410
A noble princess...

216
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:37,828
Yes.

217
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:41,249
Anyway, tomorrow I'll go to the capital.

218
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:10,486
From the next day on, the Bamboo Cutter...

219
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:14,240
... went often to the capital, with gold in his kimono.

220
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:24,083
The summer went by, and the autumn harvest came round.

221
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:32,519
Blow, O wind, blow, blow Blow hard, O wind Li'l Bamboo!

222
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:38,296
Take him!

223
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:50,484
Bring the fruits of the mountains Chestnuts, mushrooms, grapes...

224
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,987
Carry me!

225
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,286
Carry me!

226
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,677
I'll rub it all over you!

227
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,974
A pheasant!

228
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,436
It's heading for you!

229
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:26,719
Li'l Bamboo!

230
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:27,887
Chase it left!

231
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,148
Okay!

232
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,037
It's coming your way!

233
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,047
I'll get you!

234
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,892
Sutemaru!

235
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,394
Sutemaru!

236
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:09,897
Sutemaru!

237
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,028
Sutemaru!

238
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,703
I got it.

239
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,538
I got it!

240
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,165
Great!

241
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:29,917
Are you hurt?

242
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,419
I'm coming down.

243
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,214
No!

244
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,976
Sutemaru!

245
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,979
The rocks are weak here!

246
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:53,774
I'm sorry.

247
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,110
Get a long vine, will you!

248
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,486
Sure!

249
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:01,198
You're bleeding.

250
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,659
A little spit'll fix that.

251
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:05,411
No!

252
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:07,955
Wait.

253
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,762
There.

254
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,308
Li'l Bamboo...

255
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,186
... did you get bigger again?

256
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,772
You think so?

257
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:38,027
Somehow I have the feeling you'll just keep on growing...

258
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,614
... and go somewhere far away.

259
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,993
Why do you say that?

260
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:50,456
I'll always be here with you, forever and ever.

261
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:53,417
I'll always be one of your gang.

262
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,085
Sutemaru!

263
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,504
How's this?

264
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,297
Good.

265
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,595
Tie it!

266
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,679
We did!

267
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:06,806
Right!

268
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,143
Go on.

269
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:18,067
Hey, there's mushrooms here!

270
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,194
Look, Sutemaru!

271
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:21,695
You're right!

272
00:30:21,831 --> 00:30:23,813
Look at them all!

273
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,815
Tomorrow let's have a stew!

274
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,253
Yeah!

275
00:30:27,273 --> 00:30:28,316
We'll cook this bird.

276
00:30:28,671 --> 00:30:29,485
Great!

277
00:30:29,505 --> 00:30:30,319
Pheasant stew!

278
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,266
Pheasant!

279
00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:33,712
Pheasant!

280
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:35,158
Pheasant stew!

281
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,015
Sorry I'm late.

282
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,352
Sutemaru caught a pheasant.

283
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,896
And we found mushrooms and grapes!

284
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,110
Where are you going?

285
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:02,444
The capital.

286
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,904
The capital?

287
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:06,407
Me, too?

288
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,409
Now?

289
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,796
Yes.

290
00:31:09,816 --> 00:31:11,068
Leave that basket there.

291
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:15,708
But I told Sutemaru we'd all have pheasant stew.

292
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,251
Leave it.

293
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,551
Let's go.

294
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,450
Will we be back in time for stew tomorrow?

295
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:56,749
But for the Princess and Sutemaru, that tomorrow never came.

296
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,499
The young miss is awake.

297
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,506
Good morning.

298
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,200
If you please...

299
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,242
Well, well, well!

300
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:59,663
I trust Your Highest is in the bestest of spirits this finest...

301
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,707
... of mornings?

302
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,794
Momma?

303
00:34:11,393 --> 00:34:12,353
Poppa?

304
00:34:12,373 --> 00:34:13,333
Is that you?

305
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,772
You scared me!

306
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:27,608
Why are you dressed like that?

307
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,693
It doesn't suit us, does it.

308
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:30,944
Now, now!

309
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:36,575
Get yourself a range of chobe, I mean, "a change of robe"!

310
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:39,119
In there.

311
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,837
All those robes are yours, Your Highness.

312
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,637
They smell so nice!

313
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,645
They're beautiful!

314
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,485
Like a rainbow!

315
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,743
I'm glad she likes them.

316
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,245
I told you!

317
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,665
You're going to live here now.

318
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,837
In this mansion?!

319
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,338
Yes.

320
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,682
Wow!

321
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,629
Poppa, can I swim in there?

322
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,302
You most certainly may not.

323
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:26,768
A noble princess does not frolic and dance around in such a manner.

324
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,396
Your Highness...

325
00:36:29,531 --> 00:36:32,535
...

326
00:36:32,555 --> 00:36:35,559
I've summoned Lady Sagami from the palace to teach you...

327
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,572
... the ways of a noble princess.

328
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,574
A "noble princess"?

329
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,743
"Palace"?

330
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:50,417
I have never met a child so much in need of my instruction.

331
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:57,674
I will undertake to make her a truly fine lady.

332
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,221
And so with Lady Sagami...

333
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:06,767
... the princess began to learn the noble airs and graces of a lady.

334
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,102
Watch carefully.

335
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:14,566
One holds one's back straight, and stands with a "swish".

336
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,444
"Swish"?

337
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,782
That will do for now.

338
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:26,453
In any event, a noble lady stands only on rare occasions.

339
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,791
Then how do I move to pick something up?

340
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:31,750
In that case...

341
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:32,626
... thus!

342
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:37,130
One proceeds on one's knees, and always gracefully.

343
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,096
Be graceful at all times...

344
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,977
Your Highness!

345
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,317
Beautiful, is it not?

346
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:01,989
Unroll it like this, and the story flows out in the pictures.

347
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,420
Yeah!

348
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,650
It really flows!

349
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,924
Let us have a short rest.

350
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:25,512
Your enthusiasm for practicing handwriting...

351
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,515
... makes me proud.

352
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,941
Your Highness!

353
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,784
Once more, together.

354
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:54,875
Hey, this is fun!

355
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,543
Your Highness!

356
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,337
Well?

357
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,715
How's the koto practice going?

358
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,717
Sir!

359
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:13,560
I trust you are well, Father.

360
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,062
Well, well, well!

361
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,194
You're so elegant I hardly recognized you.

362
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:23,403
Whoops!

363
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:27,157
And how is the koto lesson going?

364
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:31,370
We've only just begun...

365
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,385
Well, well, well!

366
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:58,772
With me, she treats everything as if it were a game.

367
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:02,734
But then instantly she does everything perfectly.

368
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,778
That makes sense.

369
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,781
She is truly a princess from Heaven.

370
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:11,952
She is not one to stay forever out in the mountains.

371
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:20,252
Thus the princess seemed devoted to making a noble lady of herself.

372
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,280
Whoops!

373
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,491
What's going on here?!

374
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,453
Will you stop doing all this!

375
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:58,123
You are now the mother of a noble princess.

376
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:01,334
But this makes me feel at home.

377
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,338
It's because of you the princess won't...

378
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,052
Is something the matter?

379
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,514
You're very quiet.

380
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,683
Well, Husband...

381
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,694
Is that true?

382
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,029
Yes.

383
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:31,625
That's wonderful!

384
00:41:31,645 --> 00:41:33,522
We'll have to hold a banquet!

385
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:34,784
A banquet?

386
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,120
To mark your coming of age.

387
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:40,332
This is the happiest of occasions!

388
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:43,126
So we can invite my friends?

389
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,713
I miss them so much!

390
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,884
That might be nice.

391
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,552
Don't be a fool!

392
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:56,056
Do you realize how important this is?!

393
00:41:57,516 --> 00:42:01,728
We live in a different world to those hillbillies!

394
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:05,524
We'll have the naming ceremony after New Year's.

395
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,904
After your coming-out banquet you'll be a true princess!

396
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,323
Poppa...

397
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,576
This is wonderful!

398
00:42:16,711 --> 00:42:18,798
I know!

399
00:42:18,818 --> 00:42:20,905
I'll ask Inbe no Akita to be your "Name Father".

400
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,627
Is anyone here?!

401
00:42:26,012 --> 00:42:27,598
Lady Sagami?

402
00:42:27,618 --> 00:42:29,204
Lady Sagami!

403
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:34,761
What a bore.

404
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:23,810
Birds, bugs, beasts Grass, trees, flowers...

405
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:29,149
Momma, can I use this piece of the garden?

406
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:29,983
Sorry?

407
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,944
To plant things I like.

408
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,655
Why, of course you can.

409
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,241
Do what you like with it.

410
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,493
Thanks, Momma.

411
00:44:02,776 --> 00:44:03,695
No!

412
00:44:03,715 --> 00:44:04,634
Never!

413
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:12,817
You'll never be a fine princess looking like that.

414
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,362
I'll get sweat in my eyes if you pluck my eyebrows!

415
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:19,658
A noble princess does not sweat.

416
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:20,659
Now...

417
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:23,536
And blackened teeth just look weird!

418
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,705
How will I laugh?

419
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:30,043
A noble princess does not open her mouth and laugh.

420
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,378
That's stupid!

421
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:36,216
Even a princess must sweat and laugh out loud sometimes!

422
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:38,218
Or want to cry.

423
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,136
Or get mad and shout!

424
00:44:40,313 --> 00:44:41,336
No.

425
00:44:41,356 --> 00:44:42,379
A noble princess...

426
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,892
Then a noble princess isn't human!

427
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:52,565
Your Highness!

428
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:55,652
The poor thing was tied up!

429
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:01,074
Your Highness!

430
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:06,579
This way, Lord Akita.

431
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:38,486
Your Highness!

432
00:45:43,918 --> 00:45:45,567
I'm very sorry!

433
00:45:45,587 --> 00:45:47,236
She's still very young.

434
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,955
Not at all.

435
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,417
She's an adorable little princess.

436
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,412
She has yet to be made up.

437
00:45:58,432 --> 00:46:00,914
I am truly ashamed.

438
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,762
Don't give it a second thought.

439
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,765
To observe her as she really is...

440
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:11,478
... will help me think of an appropriate name.

441
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,271
I am glad to hear that.

442
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:18,151
Please bestow a fine name on our princess.

443
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:23,323
Your Highness, come and greet Lord Akita.

444
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:53,019
How do you do, sir.

445
00:46:54,646 --> 00:47:00,693
Your Highness, let Lord Akita hear you play on the koto.

446
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,390
Beautiful!

447
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:36,729
"The Shining Princess of the Supple Bamboo"...

448
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,899
"The Princess...

449
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,693
"Kaguya"?

450
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:42,902
Yes.

451
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,739
A form as graceful as slender bamboo...

452
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:49,909
... and a beauty that shines out from her.

453
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:54,330
I give her a name that means "shining light".

454
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:58,084
I thus suggest "Princess Kaguya".

455
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,086
"Princess Kaguya"!

456
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:05,758
Lord Akita, you have given her a truly fine name.

457
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:08,094
Thank you very much.

458
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:55,266
Following the rites of hair and trailing skirt...

459
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:58,478
... guests were invited in great numbers...

460
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:03,483
... to a banquet celebrating the taking of her name.

461
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:16,746
Congratulations!

462
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:20,500
"Princess Kaguya" certainly is a fine name.

463
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:48,027
There are so many fine gentlemen here!

464
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:53,366
This is a banquet to celebrate the taking of my name?

465
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,535
Yes, it is.

466
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,372
But all I'm doing is sitting.

467
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:03,668
I may as well not even be here.

468
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,737
Thank you very much!

469
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:36,576
Princess Kaguya's naming banquet went on for three days and nights.

470
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:42,373
To Princess Kaguya having her hair put up!

471
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:44,375
'Tis a fine thing!

472
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,492
A fine thing!

473
00:50:46,512 --> 00:50:48,494
A fine thing!

474
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:01,601
But isn't this all a bit pretentious?

475
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:04,270
Your "princess".

476
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,857
Princess Kaguya, or whoever it is...

477
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:11,235
... enshrined behind that bamboo blind.

478
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,782
What's wrong with us seeing if she's as beautiful as they say?

479
00:51:16,751 --> 00:51:18,336
No!

480
00:51:18,356 --> 00:51:19,941
Anything but that!

481
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:24,916
So we come to celebrate and we can't even say hello?

482
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:27,376
That's the custom!

483
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:30,630
The custom for noble women, not commoners.

484
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:31,547
Hey!

485
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:34,383
She's not a real princess.

486
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:37,303
She is a princess!

487
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:42,809
What did it cost to get her named one?

488
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:45,645
At least let us see her!

489
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,314
Maybe she's ugly!

490
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,816
What a farce!

491
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:45,199
Um...

492
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:50,663
... would you know what happened to the people who lived down below?

493
00:54:50,997 --> 00:54:54,208
I wouldn't know.

494
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:59,380
They're on a journey looking for good trees.

495
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,715
A journey?

496
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,050
They won't be back for ten years.

497
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,885
Ten years?

498
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:09,056
Use up all the trees and you kill the mountain.

499
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:14,061
Leave its power and go away, and it revives.

500
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:18,607
Give the trees ten years, and you can work them again.

501
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:21,235
Charcoal's like that, too.

502
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:27,074
But what if the mountain really is dead?

503
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:30,244
The leaves were so beautiful...

504
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:37,084
It's not dead.

505
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:43,549
Look.

506
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:48,095
The trees are getting ready for spring.

507
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:51,599
They are?

508
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:53,934
Will spring come back here?

509
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,770
Sure it will.

510
00:55:55,895 --> 00:56:01,942
Now the trees are waiting for it to come round again.

511
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:04,278
But who...

512
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:36,143
I've seen this before.

513
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:32,426
From that day on, Princess Kaguya...

514
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:37,598
... was like a different person, devoting herself to her studies...

515
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:41,435
... in pensive silence.

516
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,772
Your Highness!

517
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:54,323
Look at all these gifts!

518
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:58,786
The nobility has accepted you as one of them!

519
00:58:59,078 --> 00:59:02,456
This is the proof!

520
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:12,800
For old times' sake...

521
00:59:12,935 --> 00:59:15,939
...

522
00:59:15,959 --> 00:59:18,963
I'll weave you a fine bamboo cage for this meadow bunting.

523
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:22,977
Thank you, Father.

524
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:32,152
Thanks be to Heaven!

525
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:35,656
Thanks be to Heaven!

526
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:38,659
I'll just leave this here.

527
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,702
As word of this great beauty spread...

528
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:25,372
... huge crowds gathered outside the mansion...

529
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:29,376
... hoping to catch a glimpse of Princess Kaguya.

530
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:39,511
Do you serve Princess Kaguya?

531
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,389
Then give her this!

532
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,058
Please!

533
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:45,559
And this!

534
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:56,779
There's another crowd of gentlemen outside.

535
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:03,744
They've given me all these letters for you.

536
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:07,748
And I brought you some cherry blossoms...

537
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:11,919
... because you can't go out with that crowd outside.

538
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:14,588
Thank you!

539
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:48,288
You summoned me, Prince Ishitsukuri?

540
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,629
About that rich upstart's daughter that you named...

541
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:58,424
You mean Princess Kaguya?

542
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,134
Keep your voice down!

543
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:02,469
Did you say "Princess Kaguya"?

544
01:02:02,604 --> 01:02:04,774
Princess Kaguya?

545
01:02:04,794 --> 01:02:06,964
I've heard the gossip about her.

546
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:09,351
They say she's very beautiful.

547
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:12,187
You would shout, wouldn't you.

548
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:15,983
Beautiful she may be, but she is of humble birth.

549
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:19,153
She is not a woman for any of us.

550
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:24,491
"Princess Kaguya" is a presumptuous name...

551
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:27,745
... for a daughter of the likes of Miyatsuko.

552
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,621
No, Minister.

553
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:33,834
She is not his true daughter.

554
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:36,336
She was born from a bamboo stalk.

555
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:37,963
A bamboo stalk?

556
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,914
How interesting.

557
01:02:39,934 --> 01:02:41,708
So she's a woodland spirit?

558
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:46,263
That is not entirely impossible, Lord Counselor.

559
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:47,514
What?!

560
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:51,810
The moment I stood before her...

561
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:55,689
... this aged body began to tremble...

562
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:59,359
... as if a dry fountain had come back to life.

563
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:05,032
Just the memory of that glimmering beauty...

564
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:09,953
... leaves me completely lost for words!

565
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:20,506
Stand aside!

566
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,725
I will win this race!

567
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,144
I will be first!

568
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:37,523
That glimmering beauty will be mine!

569
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:39,900
I will have her!

570
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:42,069
I go to meet my wife!

571
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,237
Lady Sagami!

572
01:03:53,257 --> 01:03:54,614
Lady Sagami!

573
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:56,458
What is it?

574
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,418
Look at these!

575
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:02,548
Five of the land's highest-born men have come...

576
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:04,758
... and in formal dress!

577
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:05,884
Oh, my!

578
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:08,595
Thanks be to Heaven!

579
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,265
A minister, two princes...

580
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:15,435
But how will we choose among them?

581
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:20,107
They're all here together, awaiting an answer.

582
01:04:20,242 --> 01:04:21,744
I understand.

583
01:04:21,764 --> 01:04:23,266
Leave the princess to me.

584
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:25,946
You go entertain them.

585
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:27,281
I will!

586
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:30,075
Thank you very much!

587
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:33,996
Thanks be to Heaven!

588
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:37,624
That banquet was worth every penny I spent on it!

589
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,753
They are all of the highest rank.

590
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:45,132
You will not go wrong with any of them.

591
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:48,802
So, Your Highness, choose the one you wish.

592
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:51,138
Even though I don't know them?

593
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:52,556
Of course.

594
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:58,979
A gentleman makes a proposal, and you meet on your wedding day.

595
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:03,525
With your choice of these five nobles...

596
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,778
... how happy you will be!

597
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:08,822
"Happy"?

598
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:13,660
I have no wish to marry anyone yet.

599
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:15,329
You can't mean that!

600
01:05:15,454 --> 01:05:20,292
You must marry a suitable gentleman as soon as possible.

601
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:23,003
That is happiness itself.

602
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:24,838
Why would you hesitate?

603
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:29,009
With any of those men, your happiness is assured.

604
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:31,136
I will not choose any of them!

605
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:33,513
Please ask them to leave.

606
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:39,353
Do you wish to hurt your father?

607
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:44,483
He is as glad for you as he would be for himself.

608
01:05:56,004 --> 01:05:58,507
All has been made ready.

609
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:01,030
If you would come this way...

610
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:30,070
Now, if you would each speak in order of precedence.

611
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:35,075
I am Prince Kuramochi.

612
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,576
Princess...

613
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:43,583
... my feelings toward you are as I wrote in my letter.

614
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:50,590
If it came to pass that you became my wife...

615
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:55,762
... my joy would be as if I had found a jeweled branch from a tree...

616
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:58,098
... of Mount Horai in China...

617
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:01,435
... with silver roots, gold trunk, and pearls for fruit.

618
01:07:01,727 --> 01:07:07,274
To me, you are a treasure as unattainable as that.

619
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:08,275
If you would...

620
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:10,496
I am Prince Ishitsukuri.

621
01:07:10,516 --> 01:07:12,602
If you consent to be my wife...

622
01:07:12,748 --> 01:07:14,834
...

623
01:07:14,854 --> 01:07:16,940
I will worship you day and night, my forehead to the ground...

624
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:21,955
... as I would the stone begging bowl of Lord Buddha himself in India.

625
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,625
You would treat her as a piece of cold stone?

626
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:29,921
To me you are as a robe of fire-rat fur.

627
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:33,759
Put in the flames, all impurities burn away...

628
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:36,803
... but it is not consumed, and merely glistens...

629
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:39,014
... all the brighter.

630
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:45,645
You are as pure as this rare treasure of China.

631
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:49,983
You compare Princess Kaguya to a rat-skin?

632
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:52,319
To me, Princess...

633
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:56,656
... you are a jewel that glistens more radiantly...

634
01:07:56,782 --> 01:08:01,787
... than the five-colored stone that shines from the dragon's neck!

635
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:02,829
No, no, no!

636
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,998
To me, Princess Kaguya...

637
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:10,504
... is like the cowry shell the swallow warms as a treasure...

638
01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:15,092
... and a charm for safe birth.

639
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:16,343
"A treasure"...

640
01:08:16,478 --> 01:08:18,647
A cowry shell is a treasure?

641
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:20,836
It is to laugh!

642
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:24,559
Well, a dragon's neck stinks!

643
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:26,686
It's the jewel on the neck!

644
01:08:50,669 --> 01:08:53,380
What a beautiful melody!

645
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:59,052
I am grateful for these sentiments toward someone...

646
01:08:59,678 --> 01:09:02,722
... you have neither met nor seen.

647
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:04,850
I ask...

648
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:09,896
... that you bring me...

649
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:13,358
... these rare treasures of which you speak.

650
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:19,906
Then I will be able to feel clearly in my heart...

651
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:22,742
... how you treasure me.

652
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:28,415
Prince Kuramochi, bring me the jeweled branch of Horai.

653
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:32,419
Prince Ishitsukuri, Lord Buddha's stone bowl.

654
01:09:32,544 --> 01:09:33,587
But... but...

655
01:09:33,712 --> 01:09:38,258
Lord Minister of the Right Abe, bring a robe of fire-rat fur.

656
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:39,301
What?!

657
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:44,431
Grand Counselor Otomo, the jewel from the dragon's neck.

658
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:51,271
And Middle Counselor Isonokami, the swallow's cowry shell.

659
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,606
Impossible!

660
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:54,274
No, no no no...

661
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:57,777
These things may not even exist!

662
01:09:57,903 --> 01:10:01,323
They were only figures of speech!

663
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:02,782
Yes.

664
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:08,455
You have all compared me to very rare treasures.

665
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:12,751
If I can obtain one of them...

666
01:10:13,428 --> 01:10:15,597
...

667
01:10:15,617 --> 01:10:17,786
I will happily become that gentleman's "treasure".

668
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:21,968
Gentlemen, I apologize!

669
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,763
She knows nothing of the world.

670
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,942
But she must be beautiful.

671
01:10:26,962 --> 01:10:28,964
Her voice, her music...

672
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:30,988
Indeed!

673
01:10:31,008 --> 01:10:32,886
That melody was quite out of this world.

674
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:36,983
But to set us these impossible tasks...

675
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:39,319
Out of the question!

676
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:42,697
She is truly an unattainable treasure.

677
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:50,664
It's terrible!

678
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:55,168
When the nobles left, so did everyone else outside!

679
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:58,171
Just like the tide going out?

680
01:10:58,296 --> 01:10:59,506
Yes.

681
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:01,549
I thought I should tell you.

682
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:05,553
Your Highness!

683
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:11,351
Let's go!

684
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:12,686
Where?

685
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:13,687
Out!

686
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:14,771
Out?

687
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,815
To see the cherry blossoms!

688
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:20,860
Go ask Father and Mother to come, too!

689
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:25,490
There is nothing more I can do.

690
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,826
Yes, but surely...

691
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:30,996
Next time the princess will...

692
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:33,999
There will be no next time.

693
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:38,503
I will take my leave of you.

694
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,672
But...

695
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:48,305
The carriage the princess requested awaits, Squire.

696
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:51,308
Tell them to go on ahead!

697
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:51,076
Oh, my!

698
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:01,252
It's beautiful!

699
01:13:04,798 --> 01:13:05,548
Stop!

700
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:12,347
Your Highness?

701
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:35,286
How wonderful!

702
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:23,334
I'm very sorry, Milady.

703
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:29,174
Please forgive us!

704
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,181
Come on.

705
01:14:50,904 --> 01:14:52,864
They're right at their peak.

706
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:56,117
Yes, they're beautiful.

707
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,542
Let's go home.

708
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,930
Something's happened up ahead.

709
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:00,598
Someone's coming.

710
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:01,766
Sutemaru!

711
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:02,600
Run!

712
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:03,518
Sutemaru?

713
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,613
Sutemaru!

714
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:18,491
Sutemaru!

715
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:32,797
What's wrong?!

716
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,507
They'll catch us!

717
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:37,802
We're going!

718
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:51,149
Li'l Bamboo!

719
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:11,002
Sutemaru!

720
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:13,838
Sutemaru!

721
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:15,673
Sutemaru!

722
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,018
Come on.

723
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:04,555
Three years went by.

724
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:50,101
Off you go.

725
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:04,731
Isn't it a lovely day.

726
01:19:04,751 --> 01:19:06,942
Look how the garden has grown.

727
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,287
Yes, but you know...

728
01:19:11,122 --> 01:19:14,459
... it all looks different when you see it from here.

729
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,259
Well!

730
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,141
It's like the mountain back home.

731
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,267
You're right.

732
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:34,979
There's the forest, and the hill...

733
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:37,315
And there's our house.

734
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,485
And the grass is the bamboo grove.

735
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,987
The mugwort looks just like trees.

736
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:47,158
You can almost see the moon rising behind the mountain.

737
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,787
And we could go over the bridge and up the hill...

738
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:52,330
Princess!

739
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:55,166
Where is Her Highness?

740
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:57,168
You're here again?

741
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:58,836
What's wrong with it?

742
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,630
You're here all the time!

743
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:02,673
Anyway, not now.

744
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:04,342
The Prince!

745
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:08,763
Prince Kuramochi has brought the jeweled branch of Horai!

746
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:10,765
Impossible!

747
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:14,018
It's hard to believe, but he's true to his word.

748
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:18,022
You'd think he'd be angry with a task like that...

749
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:22,860
... but he really has brought back a jeweled branch!

750
01:20:23,653 --> 01:20:28,032
Your Highness, go and get ready for your wedding!

751
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:29,700
I should hurry!

752
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:33,204
The two of them will need a bedchamber!

753
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:39,168
If only Lady Sagami were here!

754
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:42,463
This can't be right!

755
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:44,882
A bedchamber...

756
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,595
Princess Kaguya!

757
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:52,056
Where is Princess Kaguya?

758
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:54,642
Please wait, Your Highness!

759
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,105
Squire Miyatsuko!

760
01:20:59,522 --> 01:21:01,399
Forgive me.

761
01:21:01,524 --> 01:21:06,904
I was in such a rush to get here I didn't change my clothes.

762
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:09,167
Oh, this is wonderful!

763
01:21:09,187 --> 01:21:11,315
Thanks be to Heaven!

764
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:13,578
Please... this way.

765
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:17,915
Come in.

766
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:39,270
Without further ado, I will show what I promised to bring.

767
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:01,626
It's so beautiful it dazzles the eye!

768
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:06,297
As you wished, the jeweled branch of Horai.

769
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:10,551
Princess Kaguya, are you in there?

770
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:14,472
Come near and take a good look.

771
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:16,140
One moment.

772
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:22,813
First, allow me to ask how you came by it.

773
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,483
Of course!

774
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:46,462
Three years ago I vowed to carry out your wish.

775
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:48,506
I boarded a ship...

776
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:52,677
... and we set course for Mount Horai.

777
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,513
Tossed by angry waves...

778
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:58,516
... and starving for lack of food...

779
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:02,520
... after all manner of trials and tribulations...

780
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,022
... "Behold!

781
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:10,695
"What is that mountain, so beautiful yet forbidding?

782
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,698
"Amazing!

783
01:23:13,823 --> 01:23:17,702
"It flows with water of gold, silver, and lapis lazuli!

784
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,203
"Look!

785
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:23,040
"A celestial maiden scoops water with a silver bowl!

786
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,292
"Hello!

787
01:23:25,835 --> 01:23:28,546
"What is the name of this mountain?"

788
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:33,050
"This is Mount Horai.

789
01:23:33,676 --> 01:23:37,388
"And my name is Ukanruri."

790
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:43,561
At last I had made my way to Mount Horai!

791
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:49,567
Without a second glance at the maiden, I climbed the mountain.

792
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:54,071
"Look at those beautiful trees!

793
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:59,910
"Silver branches, trunks of gold, and fruit of pearls!

794
01:24:00,036 --> 01:24:02,580
"How beautiful!

795
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:07,251
"Are these not the jeweled branches of Horai...

796
01:24:07,386 --> 01:24:08,888
"...

797
01:24:08,908 --> 01:24:10,410
Princess Kaguya said she wished for?"

798
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:16,761
This is the branch I snapped off then.

799
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,104
One look is worth a hundred tales.

800
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:30,608
Look upon it with your own eyes.

801
01:24:39,085 --> 01:24:39,670
No!

802
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:40,275
You can't do this!

803
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,620
Get out of my way!

804
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,290
What is the meaning of this?

805
01:24:46,467 --> 01:24:48,032
I most humbly apologize.

806
01:24:48,052 --> 01:24:49,617
I'll go see.

807
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:57,134
At least read this letter!

808
01:24:57,259 --> 01:24:58,552
What's going on?

809
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:03,307
Pay us our fee for the jeweled branch we made!

810
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:04,475
What?!

811
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:06,644
"Made"?

812
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:13,818
I am Ayabe no Uchimaro, of the Guild of Artisans.

813
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:19,740
Prince Kuramochi had us mount gems...

814
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:23,202
... and fashion them into a jeweled branch.

815
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:24,662
What?

816
01:25:24,954 --> 01:25:28,165
The Prince, however, has not yet paid us.

817
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,583
He hasn't?

818
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:31,585
Oh, dear!

819
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:36,006
And since Princess Kaguya, one of his concubines...

820
01:25:36,132 --> 01:25:40,845
... sorry, his wife, was here in this house...

821
01:25:41,137 --> 01:25:43,639
... we had no choice...

822
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:48,185
... but to come here and ask her for payment.

823
01:25:52,148 --> 01:25:53,858
I see.

824
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:57,027
Your Highness, what is the...

825
01:25:58,789 --> 01:26:00,146
Your Highness?

826
01:26:00,166 --> 01:26:01,523
Where did he go?!

827
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:04,034
Where's the branch?

828
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:07,204
His Highness has taken his leave.

829
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:08,706
What?!

830
01:26:15,588 --> 01:26:20,551
Please reward the artisans very well.

831
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:26,724
There!

832
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:33,564
Next to call at the mansion was Abe, Minister of the Right.

833
01:26:43,866 --> 01:26:45,409
Look!

834
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:48,370
See how it glistens!

835
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:56,587
The world has never seen such an expensive engagement gift.

836
01:26:57,046 --> 01:27:00,841
But if it should please Princess Kaguya...

837
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:04,011
... it is a mere trifle.

838
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:06,764
In that case...

839
01:27:06,889 --> 01:27:09,266
Ah, you're right here?

840
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:11,143
Put it into a fire.

841
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,102
Huh?

842
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:14,772
What?

843
01:27:16,065 --> 01:27:18,776
If it is truly the fur of the fire-rat...

844
01:27:19,235 --> 01:27:23,781
... it will not burn, but merely glisten all the brighter.

845
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:25,616
Of course!

846
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:29,119
This robe is the genuine article!

847
01:27:29,245 --> 01:27:31,956
Placed in the fire, it will not burn.

848
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:35,793
Or at least, it "should not" burn.

849
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:40,047
Unless of course between myself and the princess...

850
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:44,635
... there remains some unwarranted impurity.

851
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,470
Yes, indeed.

852
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:49,640
All the more reason to test it.

853
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:54,436
Burn away all the impurity of my doubts.

854
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,441
Oh, all right!

855
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:42,359
What did I tell you?

856
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:43,861
You see?

857
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,039
Ow!

858
01:28:59,001 --> 01:29:01,879
My fortune is burning!

859
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:15,559
I've lost everything!

860
01:29:24,193 --> 01:29:27,071
Do you realize how much this cost?!

861
01:29:27,196 --> 01:29:30,240
Look at it, will you!

862
01:29:30,366 --> 01:29:33,243
"Burn it," she says!

863
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:37,581
How infuriating!

864
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:51,095
I wonder how much the Minister spent on that fake.

865
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:54,640
I assume that is what I am to those gentlemen.

866
01:29:55,557 --> 01:30:00,104
A fake jeweled branch, or a rat-fur robe that burns.

867
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:05,109
Both those objects were very expensive.

868
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,778
But don't worry.

869
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:11,865
Grand Counselor Otomo has indeed put to sea...

870
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:16,537
... in quest of the gem hanging from the dragon's neck.

871
01:30:17,246 --> 01:30:21,792
They say in order to marry you...

872
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:24,294
... he has sent his wife away...

873
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,798
... and completely rebuilt his mansion.

874
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:32,302
A warrior's resolve is a wondrous thing.

875
01:30:36,942 --> 01:30:38,299
All right, Dragon!

876
01:30:38,319 --> 01:30:39,676
Have at me!

877
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:46,024
Careful!

878
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,550
The Dragon!

879
01:31:12,519 --> 01:31:14,271
Forgive me!

880
01:31:14,291 --> 01:31:16,043
Forgive me!

881
01:31:28,025 --> 01:31:30,235
Another one!

882
01:31:32,196 --> 01:31:33,655
Help me!

883
01:31:33,832 --> 01:31:35,606
Calm down!

884
01:31:35,626 --> 01:31:37,400
The storm will blow itself out.

885
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:54,051
About that time, Prince Ishitsukuri was paying a call on Princess Kaguya.

886
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:20,035
Well, Your Highness, is this Lord Buddha's stone bowl?

887
01:32:20,244 --> 01:32:22,454
Give this to her.

888
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:25,123
What is it exactly?

889
01:32:25,249 --> 01:32:27,292
Give it to her, please.

890
01:32:27,417 --> 01:32:30,462
Yes, but...

891
01:32:36,093 --> 01:32:40,806
Your Highness, this is from Prince Ishitsukuri.

892
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:59,825
Since I first heard your voice three years ago...

893
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:02,953
... you have been constantly on my mind.

894
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:08,166
Desperately I searched for "Buddha's stone begging bowl".

895
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:13,338
I crossed meadow and mountain, visiting every temple in the land.

896
01:33:14,131 --> 01:33:18,844
Eventually, weary as could be, I sat on a rock by the roadside.

897
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:25,684
Suddenly my eye fell upon a wildflower there at my feet.

898
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:29,073
Ah!

899
01:33:29,093 --> 01:33:31,846
My feelings for you bloomed unknown, I thought...

900
01:33:31,982 --> 01:33:34,693
... just like that flower.

901
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:40,198
Suddenly the realization dawned...

902
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:43,869
... that what I wanted to give you...

903
01:33:43,994 --> 01:33:47,539
... and you wanted to receive...

904
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:52,044
... was not some unattainable treasure, but that flower.

905
01:33:52,336 --> 01:33:57,382
In other words, the symbol of my devotion to you.

906
01:33:58,175 --> 01:33:59,551
"Devotion"...

907
01:34:00,687 --> 01:34:02,231
Princess Kaguya!

908
01:34:02,251 --> 01:34:03,795
You are the one...

909
01:34:03,972 --> 01:34:07,392
... to whom I would give my heart.

910
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:11,897
Would you accept that lovely flower...

911
01:34:12,022 --> 01:34:14,232
... and my devotion?

912
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:20,405
I have always loved plants.

913
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:26,244
I am entranced by the nameless flowers that grow by the roadside.

914
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:29,581
And I always wish...

915
01:34:29,883 --> 01:34:31,865
...

916
01:34:31,885 --> 01:34:33,867
I could live as one of those flowers of the field.

917
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:45,263
Princess, come with me to some place that is not this one.

918
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:49,643
Let us leave the capital and its formalities...

919
01:34:50,227 --> 01:34:54,940
... for a rich green land of flowers, birds, and leaping fish.

920
01:34:55,399 --> 01:34:57,275
Somewhere not here.

921
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:04,449
We will laugh, sing, and sleep to our hearts' content.

922
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:08,620
Morning to night, the seasons meeting our needs...

923
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:11,790
... let us spin a beautiful tale.

924
01:35:13,417 --> 01:35:17,796
Come with me to somewhere that is not here!

925
01:35:18,255 --> 01:35:24,302
A land of green where flowers bloom, birds sing, and fish dance!

926
01:35:24,428 --> 01:35:26,972
Somewhere that is not here!

927
01:35:38,358 --> 01:35:39,651
What?!

928
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:44,156
"Somewhere that is not here"?

929
01:35:44,448 --> 01:35:49,077
I would very much like to be taken there again.

930
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:51,329
I'm sorry!

931
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:53,498
Forgive me!

932
01:35:57,085 --> 01:35:59,838
How many flowers...

933
01:35:59,963 --> 01:36:05,010
... have you plucked and thrown away...

934
01:36:05,135 --> 01:36:09,139
... leaving them to shave their heads in despair...

935
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:12,684
... and become nuns?

936
01:36:17,063 --> 01:36:18,857
I've found one!

937
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,526
Get me down!

938
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:22,986
Remaining now...

939
01:36:23,153 --> 01:36:28,700
... was Middle Counselor Isonokami, and the swallow's cowry shell.

940
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:32,996
Counselor!

941
01:36:41,671 --> 01:36:43,089
He's dead?!

942
01:36:43,215 --> 01:36:44,049
Yes.

943
01:36:44,174 --> 01:36:48,720
The fall broke the Middle Counselor's back.

944
01:37:14,371 --> 01:37:15,831
What's wrong?

945
01:37:16,883 --> 01:37:18,344
This garden!

946
01:37:18,364 --> 01:37:19,825
It's a fake!

947
01:37:21,837 --> 01:37:22,629
Fake!

948
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,422
Fake!

949
01:37:24,673 --> 01:37:25,757
Fake!

950
01:37:26,216 --> 01:37:27,592
Fake!

951
01:37:27,727 --> 01:37:28,479
All of it!

952
01:37:28,499 --> 01:37:29,251
Fake!

953
01:37:29,553 --> 01:37:32,430
And so am I!

954
01:37:32,722 --> 01:37:33,807
Stop it.

955
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:45,944
It's my fault everyone's miserable.

956
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:48,332
It's not your fault.

957
01:37:48,352 --> 01:37:50,104
It's not.

958
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:53,785
It is my fault.

959
01:37:54,578 --> 01:37:56,621
Because I'm a fake!

960
01:37:57,581 --> 01:37:58,456
Princess!

961
01:37:58,582 --> 01:38:02,627
I never dreamed things would turn out like this!

962
01:38:02,752 --> 01:38:03,962
Of course not.

963
01:38:04,713 --> 01:38:07,632
But it's not your fault.

964
01:38:18,184 --> 01:38:24,107
Now, in spite of her wishes, there was even more talk of her.

965
01:38:24,232 --> 01:38:28,320
His Majesty himself became interested.

966
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:34,659
She has toyed with five of the greatest nobles.

967
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:36,536
Fascinating.

968
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:38,997
That must mean...

969
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:44,502
... this "Princess Kaguya" wishes to come to me.

970
01:38:46,379 --> 01:38:50,008
Send word that she is to come and serve at court.

971
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:51,593
Yes, Sire.

972
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:56,681
If she comes, I'll give her father, Sanuki no Miyatsuko...

973
01:38:56,806 --> 01:38:58,892
... a court rank!

974
01:38:59,309 --> 01:39:00,852
Yes, Sire.

975
01:39:01,645 --> 01:39:03,438
Thanks be to Heaven!

976
01:39:03,647 --> 01:39:05,690
Your Highness!

977
01:39:05,825 --> 01:39:06,660
Please!

978
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:07,515
No more of this!

979
01:39:07,651 --> 01:39:09,027
Your Highness!

980
01:39:11,831 --> 01:39:13,417
Your Highness!

981
01:39:13,437 --> 01:39:15,023
Rejoice!

982
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:20,205
His Majesty summons you to serve him at court!

983
01:39:20,997 --> 01:39:24,042
You'll be one of his ladies.

984
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:26,795
And I'll wear a courtier's cap!

985
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:29,214
Thanks be to Heaven!

986
01:39:29,339 --> 01:39:32,384
You still don't understand how she feels?

987
01:39:32,509 --> 01:39:34,344
You don't understand!

988
01:39:34,511 --> 01:39:37,138
This is what I've worked for!

989
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:39,057
A court lady!

990
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:43,228
There is no greater happiness for a girl in this land!

991
01:39:44,104 --> 01:39:47,899
At last the princess will be happy!

992
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:49,401
Father...

993
01:39:49,703 --> 01:39:51,205
...

994
01:39:51,225 --> 01:39:52,727
I'm sorry, but please refuse.

995
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:55,907
I couldn't be His Majesty's now.

996
01:39:56,543 --> 01:39:58,463
What?!

997
01:39:58,483 --> 01:40:00,403
This is for your sake...

998
01:40:00,537 --> 01:40:02,247
Tell him no.

999
01:40:03,206 --> 01:40:04,582
But...

1000
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:09,421
... no one in this land may disobey an order from His Majesty!

1001
01:40:09,556 --> 01:40:11,079
Now, please!

1002
01:40:11,099 --> 01:40:12,622
Don't be so contrary!

1003
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:18,596
If you wish to accuse me...

1004
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:21,933
... of disobedience to His Majesty...

1005
01:40:23,226 --> 01:40:26,730
... then feel free to kill me.

1006
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:28,106
Princess!

1007
01:40:28,231 --> 01:40:34,946
If your happiness depends on a courtier's cap...

1008
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:38,450
... then I will go to him.

1009
01:40:39,242 --> 01:40:44,289
When I see you wearing that cap, then I will kill myself.

1010
01:40:58,063 --> 01:40:59,670
What?

1011
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:01,297
She refuses?

1012
01:41:01,765 --> 01:41:03,475
What can this mean?

1013
01:41:03,725 --> 01:41:08,271
I never dreamed a woman would ever turn me down.

1014
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:12,453
Fascinating.

1015
01:41:12,473 --> 01:41:14,476
I wish to meet her all the more.

1016
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:20,617
In that case, I'll pay a quiet visit to the Miyatsuko mansion.

1017
01:41:21,618 --> 01:41:22,994
Yes, Sire.

1018
01:41:40,136 --> 01:41:42,180
This way, please.

1019
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:49,270
She plays wonderfully.

1020
01:42:10,834 --> 01:42:13,044
How beautiful!

1021
01:42:25,348 --> 01:42:29,060
Come with me to the palace.

1022
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:31,271
Why are you doing this?!

1023
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:35,066
No woman is unhappy when I do this.

1024
01:42:35,191 --> 01:42:37,735
I will never be yours!

1025
01:42:37,861 --> 01:42:43,074
You must be, if I wish it.

1026
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:46,077
Bring the palanquin!

1027
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:53,084
What?

1028
01:42:53,543 --> 01:42:54,752
Where are you?

1029
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:02,427
Where did you go?

1030
01:43:22,415 --> 01:43:25,168
I apologize for acting in haste.

1031
01:43:25,188 --> 01:43:27,941
Please show yourself.

1032
01:43:29,245 --> 01:43:30,288
Please.

1033
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:34,959
I will burn the sight of you into my eyes and leave.

1034
01:43:44,928 --> 01:43:46,804
How beautiful!

1035
01:43:49,933 --> 01:43:51,601
Forgive me.

1036
01:43:56,773 --> 01:43:58,650
I will withdraw.

1037
01:43:58,942 --> 01:44:02,070
But I still believe...

1038
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:05,323
... your happiness lies in being mine.

1039
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:09,827
Beautiful!

1040
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:41,234
His Majesty returned to his palace.

1041
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:46,197
Now, every night that the moon was out...

1042
01:44:46,322 --> 01:44:49,367
... the princess would gaze up at it.

1043
01:45:10,013 --> 01:45:11,764
What's wrong?

1044
01:45:12,515 --> 01:45:15,560
Lately you don't come to see me.

1045
01:45:16,853 --> 01:45:22,233
You've left your spinning to sit, and your garden to grow wild.

1046
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:25,570
You sit every night and gaze at the moon.

1047
01:45:25,695 --> 01:45:28,406
What's the matter?

1048
01:45:28,698 --> 01:45:30,074
Nothing.

1049
01:45:30,199 --> 01:45:33,077
It's something.

1050
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:36,581
I can tell by the look in your eyes.

1051
01:45:37,373 --> 01:45:39,709
There's really nothing wrong.

1052
01:45:39,876 --> 01:45:41,753
That's not true.

1053
01:45:49,177 --> 01:45:52,263
Can't you tell even me?

1054
01:45:58,728 --> 01:46:01,939
I don't want to go back to the Moon!

1055
01:46:02,899 --> 01:46:04,108
"Go back"?

1056
01:46:04,901 --> 01:46:06,110
"To the Moon"?

1057
01:46:06,235 --> 01:46:10,615
I've begged them to let me stay!

1058
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:12,002
Here!

1059
01:46:12,022 --> 01:46:13,274
In this land!

1060
01:46:14,077 --> 01:46:18,206
But they're coming for me on the 15th night!

1061
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:19,957
Coming for you?

1062
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:24,629
I don't understand.

1063
01:46:25,338 --> 01:46:26,964
Your Highness...

1064
01:46:27,298 --> 01:46:31,803
... tell me something that makes sense.

1065
01:46:33,231 --> 01:46:35,338
You poor thing!

1066
01:46:35,358 --> 01:46:37,465
This is serious, isn't it.

1067
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:54,992
I am one who was sent down here from the Moon.

1068
01:46:55,118 --> 01:46:56,661
The Moon?!

1069
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:01,666
So that's what it was!

1070
01:47:01,791 --> 01:47:02,834
Yes.

1071
01:47:04,043 --> 01:47:08,840
I only realized that when His Majesty came.

1072
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:15,513
And now on the 15th I must leave you...

1073
01:47:16,097 --> 01:47:18,057
... and go back.

1074
01:47:18,985 --> 01:47:20,821
To the Moon?

1075
01:47:20,841 --> 01:47:22,677
And leave us?

1076
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:26,357
What have we done to deserve this?

1077
01:47:26,816 --> 01:47:31,487
Everything we've done has been for your happiness!

1078
01:47:32,321 --> 01:47:37,493
That happiness you wished for me was hard to bear.

1079
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:40,496
Without realizing it...

1080
01:47:40,798 --> 01:47:42,155
...

1081
01:47:42,175 --> 01:47:43,532
I prayed to the Moon to save me.

1082
01:47:44,167 --> 01:47:48,880
When His Majesty embraced me, my heart screamed out...

1083
01:47:49,338 --> 01:47:52,049
... "I don't want to be here!"

1084
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:58,055
You deliberately called them to take you back?

1085
01:47:58,514 --> 01:48:01,726
How could you!

1086
01:48:01,851 --> 01:48:04,520
What have you done?!

1087
01:48:04,739 --> 01:48:06,324
But I don't want to go.

1088
01:48:06,344 --> 01:48:07,929
Not like this!

1089
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:09,901
Then why not just stay?

1090
01:48:10,036 --> 01:48:11,788
Fine!

1091
01:48:11,808 --> 01:48:13,560
Even if they come to take you...

1092
01:48:13,706 --> 01:48:14,541
...

1093
01:48:14,561 --> 01:48:15,396
I won't let them!

1094
01:48:15,531 --> 01:48:17,074
It's too late...

1095
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,576
... for everything!

1096
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:24,916
What have I been doing down here?!

1097
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:29,086
Throwing tantrums about belonging to someone...

1098
01:48:29,212 --> 01:48:31,589
... ignoring your wishes...

1099
01:48:31,714 --> 01:48:36,052
... and fooling myself with fake meadows and mountains!

1100
01:48:38,221 --> 01:48:45,770
But now that I have to leave I finally remember...

1101
01:48:47,605 --> 01:48:52,777
... why I came down to this place...

1102
01:48:53,694 --> 01:49:00,952
... and why, in this strange land, I'd always known that song.

1103
01:49:02,578 --> 01:49:08,960
"Birds, bugs, beasts"...

1104
01:49:09,126 --> 01:49:11,963
That's right.

1105
01:49:12,473 --> 01:49:15,706
I was born to truly live!

1106
01:49:15,726 --> 01:49:18,959
Just like the birds and the beasts.

1107
01:49:23,933 --> 01:49:25,643
I don't want to leave!

1108
01:49:26,394 --> 01:49:29,897
Do you think I'd let you go?!

1109
01:49:30,273 --> 01:49:34,819
From the day I took you out of that bamboo stalk...

1110
01:49:35,288 --> 01:49:37,124
...

1111
01:49:37,144 --> 01:49:38,980
I've loved you as if you were my own child!

1112
01:49:41,450 --> 01:49:47,331
When I held you, changed you, set you on your feet...

1113
01:49:47,633 --> 01:49:49,553
...

1114
01:49:49,573 --> 01:49:51,493
I was as happy as if I were in Heaven!

1115
01:49:57,466 --> 01:49:59,677
It's not too late!

1116
01:49:59,802 --> 01:50:02,930
You're still here!

1117
01:50:03,055 --> 01:50:06,183
Here in my arms!

1118
01:50:07,268 --> 01:50:08,936
We'll drive them away!

1119
01:50:09,729 --> 01:50:13,357
No matter how many come for you!

1120
01:50:14,150 --> 01:50:15,693
Is anyone here?!

1121
01:50:16,152 --> 01:50:19,113
Prepare to defend the princess!

1122
01:50:22,491 --> 01:50:25,369
I'm sorry, Father.

1123
01:50:37,298 --> 01:50:39,842
What a lot of noise!

1124
01:50:43,137 --> 01:50:45,681
Let's sing to keep up our spirits.

1125
01:50:55,274 --> 01:52:32,288
Round, round, go round Waterwheel, go round Go round, and call Mr Sun Go round, and call Mr Sun Birds, bugs, beasts Grass, trees, flowers Bring spring and summer, fall and winter Bring spring and summer, fall and winter Go round, come round, come round Come round, O distant time Come round, call back my heart Come round, call back my heart Birds, bugs, beasts Grass, trees, flowers Teach me how to feel If I hear that you pine for me I will return to you There's another verse to that song?

1126
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:34,290
Long ago...

1127
01:52:34,415 --> 01:52:40,129
... someone who'd come back from here used to sing it on the Moon.

1128
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:47,136
When you put on the robe of the Moon, you lose all memory of this place.

1129
01:52:47,428 --> 01:52:49,805
All grief and sadness are gone.

1130
01:52:50,765 --> 01:52:56,812
But when she sang that song, tears would come to her eyes.

1131
01:52:59,607 --> 01:53:05,154
And for some reason, that magic took my heart, too.

1132
01:53:06,614 --> 01:53:10,659
And now I understand exactly how she felt.

1133
01:53:11,744 --> 01:53:14,997
And why I yearned for here, and broke the rules...

1134
01:53:15,289 --> 01:53:18,793
... and maybe why I was sent down here.

1135
01:53:19,543 --> 01:53:20,669
Princess!

1136
01:53:21,462 --> 01:53:23,005
She wanted...

1137
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:26,144
... to come back here.

1138
01:53:26,164 --> 01:53:29,168
I'm sure of it!

1139
01:53:31,138 --> 01:53:35,684
"If I hear that you pine for me, I will return to you."

1140
01:53:36,977 --> 01:53:40,314
"If you are truly waiting for me...

1141
01:53:40,616 --> 01:53:42,223
"...

1142
01:53:42,243 --> 01:53:43,850
I will come straight back."

1143
01:53:43,994 --> 01:53:46,081
I want to go home!

1144
01:53:46,101 --> 01:53:48,188
Right now!

1145
01:53:54,004 --> 01:53:55,903
Prepare a carriage, please.

1146
01:53:55,923 --> 01:53:57,822
Don't tell anyone.

1147
01:54:46,964 --> 01:54:48,757
All these ginger flowers!

1148
01:55:15,576 --> 01:55:17,620
It's been a long time.

1149
01:55:17,745 --> 01:55:18,662
Num-nums!

1150
01:55:18,787 --> 01:55:20,956
What, are you hungry?

1151
01:55:29,256 --> 01:55:30,799
Did you hear that?

1152
01:55:32,426 --> 01:55:33,677
Nope.

1153
01:55:34,261 --> 01:55:35,638
I'll go on ahead.

1154
01:55:57,284 --> 01:55:59,161
Sutemaru?

1155
01:55:59,453 --> 01:56:00,287
Is that you?

1156
01:56:00,621 --> 01:56:01,997
Li'l Bamboo?

1157
01:56:02,456 --> 01:56:03,999
Can I call you that?

1158
01:56:09,797 --> 01:56:12,341
We're just getting back here.

1159
01:56:12,466 --> 01:56:16,178
Coming over the pass, I thought I heard you singing.

1160
01:56:16,303 --> 01:56:18,180
I'm so glad to see you!

1161
01:56:20,307 --> 01:56:22,184
Uh, yeah.

1162
01:56:23,978 --> 01:56:26,855
But why are you here, and dressed like that?

1163
01:56:26,981 --> 01:56:30,025
All this time I've wanted to come home.

1164
01:56:30,985 --> 01:56:32,695
"Home"?

1165
01:56:33,821 --> 01:56:34,738
Here?

1166
01:56:34,863 --> 01:56:36,031
Yes.

1167
01:56:37,825 --> 01:56:40,077
Didn't you like the capital?

1168
01:56:41,537 --> 01:56:46,875
You had nice clothes, a mansion, fine food...

1169
01:56:47,001 --> 01:56:51,588
All the time I was thinking about how we all used to play here.

1170
01:56:51,714 --> 01:56:54,466
They'll all be here soon.

1171
01:56:54,675 --> 01:56:56,885
With you, Sutemaru...

1172
01:57:00,848 --> 01:57:05,853
With you, Sutemaru, I might have been happy.

1173
01:57:07,104 --> 01:57:08,647
With me?

1174
01:57:09,356 --> 01:57:11,233
Now I realize that.

1175
01:57:13,193 --> 01:57:14,236
Yeah, right!

1176
01:57:15,362 --> 01:57:18,073
You couldn't live like we do.

1177
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:19,961
Sure I could!

1178
01:57:19,981 --> 01:57:21,734
I did when we were kids.

1179
01:57:32,046 --> 01:57:33,255
In these clothes?

1180
01:57:34,214 --> 01:57:36,425
Half-starving, eating roots?

1181
01:57:38,177 --> 01:57:40,763
Sometimes having to steal?

1182
01:57:40,888 --> 01:57:42,431
I saw that!

1183
01:57:44,391 --> 01:57:47,102
I got you beaten up.

1184
01:57:47,227 --> 01:57:48,687
That was nothing.

1185
01:57:48,864 --> 01:57:51,138
You're right!

1186
01:57:51,158 --> 01:57:53,432
As long as you can answer back by being alive.

1187
01:57:56,236 --> 01:57:58,781
I'm sure I would have been happy.

1188
01:58:03,744 --> 01:58:04,953
Li'l Bamboo!

1189
01:58:06,747 --> 01:58:08,207
But it won't happen.

1190
01:58:09,124 --> 01:58:10,626
It's too late.

1191
01:58:10,876 --> 01:58:12,127
Too late?

1192
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:16,298
His Majesty?

1193
01:58:16,423 --> 01:58:17,466
No!

1194
01:58:17,716 --> 01:58:19,384
No one will own me!

1195
01:58:19,510 --> 01:58:20,302
Well, then...

1196
01:58:20,469 --> 01:58:21,303
It won't happen.

1197
01:58:21,438 --> 01:58:22,440
Why not?

1198
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:23,462
We could start now.

1199
01:58:25,432 --> 01:58:26,642
Let's run away.

1200
01:58:26,767 --> 01:58:27,851
Right now!

1201
01:58:28,102 --> 01:58:30,312
I'll carry you on my back.

1202
01:58:30,521 --> 01:58:33,649
We'll go far away, where no one knows us.

1203
01:58:34,441 --> 01:58:36,985
I can't run away now.

1204
01:58:37,277 --> 01:58:38,737
Sure you can!

1205
01:58:39,029 --> 01:58:41,490
If they find us, I'll protect you!

1206
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:43,492
They've already found me.

1207
01:58:43,784 --> 01:58:45,327
What do you mean?

1208
01:58:46,286 --> 01:58:47,830
I've been found.

1209
01:58:50,124 --> 01:58:51,583
So you've been found.

1210
01:58:52,459 --> 01:58:53,585
So what?!

1211
01:58:53,836 --> 01:58:55,045
Who cares?

1212
01:58:55,170 --> 01:58:56,588
I want us to run away!

1213
01:59:00,467 --> 01:59:01,426
Come on!

1214
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:04,721
Sutemaru!

1215
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:07,224
Right!

1216
01:59:10,821 --> 01:59:12,156
I'll run, too!

1217
01:59:12,176 --> 01:59:13,511
As fast as I can!

1218
01:59:35,002 --> 01:59:36,378
Li'l Bamboo!

1219
01:59:36,837 --> 01:59:37,713
Li'l Bamboo!

1220
01:59:37,838 --> 01:59:39,381
Sutemaru!

1221
02:00:06,210 --> 02:00:07,962
O heaven and earth!

1222
02:00:07,982 --> 02:00:09,734
Take me in!

1223
02:01:37,457 --> 02:01:38,542
Please!

1224
02:01:38,667 --> 02:01:41,003
Let me stay a little longer!

1225
02:01:41,712 --> 02:01:46,174
Just a little longer, to feel the joy of living in this place!

1226
02:01:46,383 --> 02:01:47,676
What do you mean?

1227
02:01:47,801 --> 02:01:49,511
I'm holding you!

1228
02:01:49,771 --> 02:01:51,295
Hold me tighter!

1229
02:01:51,315 --> 02:01:52,839
Don't let me go!

1230
02:01:56,977 --> 02:01:58,186
Li'l Bamboo!

1231
02:01:59,479 --> 02:02:00,647
Li'l Bamboo!

1232
02:02:18,665 --> 02:02:20,042
Li'l Bamboo!

1233
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:22,711
Li'l Bamboo!

1234
02:02:25,339 --> 02:02:26,548
A dream?

1235
02:02:30,677 --> 02:02:32,220
I dreamed that?

1236
02:02:34,848 --> 02:02:36,725
Poppa!

1237
02:02:37,351 --> 02:02:39,061
Poppa!

1238
02:02:54,368 --> 02:02:55,744
Poppa!

1239
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:17,015
Now, at last, August 15th came round.

1240
02:04:03,603 --> 02:04:04,771
Loose arrows!

1241
02:04:39,264 --> 02:04:40,182
Princess!

1242
02:04:40,599 --> 02:04:41,808
Princess!

1243
02:04:43,101 --> 02:04:45,312
Princess!

1244
02:04:45,437 --> 02:04:47,814
Princess!

1245
02:04:48,231 --> 02:04:49,316
Princess!

1246
02:05:19,304 --> 02:05:20,055
Princess...

1247
02:06:35,672 --> 02:07:09,956
Birds, bugs, beasts Grass, trees, flowers Flower, bear fruit, and die Be born, grow up, and die Still the wind blows, the rain falls The waterwheel goes round Lifetimes come and go in turn Lifetimes come and go in turn Princess!

1248
02:07:10,425 --> 02:07:16,182
Lifetimes come and go in turn Princess!

1249
02:07:16,202 --> 02:07:21,959
Don't go!

1250
02:07:22,427 --> 02:07:23,637
Wait!

1251
02:07:24,262 --> 02:07:25,639
Please, wait.

1252
02:07:26,931 --> 02:07:28,933
Once I don this robe...

1253
02:07:29,277 --> 02:07:31,113
...

1254
02:07:31,133 --> 02:07:32,969
I will forget everything about this place.

1255
02:07:33,355 --> 02:07:35,482
Give me a little more time.

1256
02:07:38,276 --> 02:07:39,486
Princess!

1257
02:07:44,292 --> 02:07:45,211
Momma!

1258
02:07:45,231 --> 02:07:46,150
Poppa!

1259
02:07:48,453 --> 02:07:49,496
Princess!

1260
02:07:49,621 --> 02:07:52,123
Take us with you!

1261
02:07:53,291 --> 02:07:56,127
Poppa, Momma... forgive me!

1262
02:07:57,128 --> 02:07:59,172
Come along.

1263
02:07:59,297 --> 02:08:02,342
In the purity of the City of the Moon...

1264
02:08:02,467 --> 02:08:07,347
... leave behind this world's sorrow and uncleanness.

1265
02:08:07,472 --> 02:08:08,848
It's not unclean!

1266
02:08:11,810 --> 02:08:13,728
There's joy, there's grief...

1267
02:08:13,853 --> 02:08:17,357
All who live here feel them in all their different shades!

1268
02:08:17,982 --> 02:08:20,360
There's birds, bugs, beasts...

1269
02:08:20,485 --> 02:08:22,028
... grass, trees, flowers...

1270
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:24,197
... and feelings.

1271
02:08:27,409 --> 02:08:28,702
Princess!

1272
02:08:40,505 --> 02:08:42,382
Princess!

1273
02:09:05,029 --> 02:09:06,239
Princess!

1274
02:09:35,393 --> 02:09:39,272
Forgive me!

1275
02:11:34,846 --> 02:17:02,537
The joy I felt when I touched you Went deep, deep down And seeped into Every nook and cranny of this body Even if I'm far away And no longer understand anything Even when the time comes For this life to end Everything of now Is everything of the past We'll meet again, I'm sure In some nostalgic place The warmth you gave me Deep, deep down Comes to me now, complete From a time long past Steadily in my heart The flames of passion give light And softly soothe my pain Down to the depths of my grief Everything now Is hope for the future I'll remember, I'm sure In some nostalgic place Voices Aki Asakura Kengo Kora Takeo Chii Nobuko Miyamoto Supervising Animator Kenichi Konishi Key Animation Shinji Hashimoto Takayuki Hamada Masashi Ando Akiko Yamaguchi Paint Outline and Texture Animation Masaya Saito Animation Check Maiko Nogami Color Setting Yukiko Kakita Director of Digital Imaging Keisuke Nakamura English Translation by Ian MacDougall Subtitles by Aura Rieko Izutsu-Vajirasarn and Studio Ghibli Production Koji Hoshino Studio Ghibli Producer Yoshiaki Nishimura Directed by Isao Takahata
