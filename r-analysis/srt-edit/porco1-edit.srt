1
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,434
- Yeah?

2
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:55,488
- Porco Rosso!

3
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,969
The Mamma Aiutos are on the move!

4
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,799
The Mamma Aiutos?

5
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,299
I don't work cheap, you know.

6
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,069
They're after a boat out of Venice carrying a mine payroll.

7
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,209
Is that all?

8
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,000
Uh, no...

9
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,800
There's a girls'-school tour aboard.

10
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,950
- That'll cost you.

11
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,030
- We'll pay Section 14-3 rates.

12
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,889
And 14-4, too.

13
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,319
Heave to!

14
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,029
Heave to or we sink you!

15
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,119
Wow!

16
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:28,218
Pirates!

17
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:35,860
Not just 'pirates'! 'Air pirates'!

18
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:05,390
Time for an overhaul...

19
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,635
- Are you bad guys?

20
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:34,990
- Yep.

21
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,375
- So we're hostages?

22
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:37,760
- Yep.

23
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,195
- Are you air pirates?

24
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:40,630
- What a smart little girl!

25
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,910
- A skull!

26
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,190
- And very well-drawn!

27
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,850
- Come on!

28
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,510
We're in a hurry!

29
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,170
- There's 15.

30
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,830
Do we take them all?

31
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:57,570
It's not nice to break up the group!

32
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,769
Too late!

33
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,275
They took the girls and the money!

34
00:04:15,295 --> 00:04:17,790
Bring them back for us!

35
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:25,970
They went that way!

36
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,839
No!

37
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:32,738
They didn't go that way!

38
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,889
I know what those cheapskates are up to.

39
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,129
They'll change course for the nearest island as soon as they're out of sight.

40
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,190
They can't afford to waste gas.

41
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:53,000
Uh-oh...

42
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,700
Come on!

43
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:17,769
I don't have much time...

44
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:24,530
Gotcha!

45
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,849
Just a tour plane going round the islands...

46
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,439
Hey, it's a pig!

47
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:40,038
A pig!

48
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,843
Hey, piggy!

49
00:05:40,863 --> 00:05:41,646
He's so cute!

50
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,449
Look over here!

51
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,120
Hang around here and the pirates'll get you!

52
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:58,300
Cool!

53
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,579
Will you all shut up!

54
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,020
We're flying!

55
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,470
Let me see!

56
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,655
Hey!

57
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:12,840
Cut that out!

58
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,025
Quiet!

59
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:15,210
Be quiet, will you?!

60
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,719
- Do something!

61
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:22,088
- You're the one who said to bring them all!

62
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,259
Just for a second...

63
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,229
I'm not supposed to let you do this...

64
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,655
It's so beautiful!

65
00:06:27,675 --> 00:06:29,090
Look!

66
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,380
- A red plane!

67
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,670
- Where?

68
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,960
Where?

69
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:39,849
Did you see it?

70
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,649
That's as far as you go!

71
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,360
- Here it comes!

72
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,080
- It's Porco!

73
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:53,060
I can't see!

74
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,999
Oh, no!

75
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,089
It stopped!

76
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:57,188
We'll crash!

77
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,969
We've got another engine!

78
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,316
What are you doing?!

79
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:05,672
Fire!

80
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,028
Fire!

81
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:13,279
That red plane's tough!

82
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,750
You missed!

83
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,526
Move!

84
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:28,442
A message from the pig: - 'You're beat.

85
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:31,358
Do as I say.' - Shut up!

86
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,044
He's coming!

87
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:36,728
Get down!

88
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,109
Where did he go?!

89
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,040
He's hiding!

90
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,070
We crashed!

91
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,300
We're going to sink!

92
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,365
No, we won't!

93
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:03,350
This is a seaplane!

94
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,099
We're sinking!

95
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,300
Hey!

96
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,510
Stop that!

97
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,720
Halt!

98
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,930
You're hostages!

99
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,885
Don't worry.

100
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:14,770
We're all on the swim team.

101
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,200
- That's not what I mean!

102
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,630
- Another message!

103
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,860
'You can have half the money.

104
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,980
Give me the rest and the kids.' 'Or I'll kill all of you.' Which means...

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,326
...half the money!

106
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:32,672
- Shut up!

107
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:34,018
Come on, you swine!

108
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:40,520
It's you and me!

109
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,809
Take that!

110
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:51,400
It's busted!

111
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:02,059
Bye-bye!

112
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:09,520
Don't be such a sap!

113
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,769
Be quiet, will you?

114
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,694
Don't pull on that!

115
00:09:18,714 --> 00:09:21,628
You'll break it!

116
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,709
Stay away from the propeller!

117
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,790
You've got to pee?

118
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,880
Just do it there.

119
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,749
So the Mamma Aiutos can't come tonight...

120
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,420
And that filthy pig bounty hunter is a hero!

121
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,629
But this young kid's an American, isn't he?

122
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,529
The air pirates of the Adriatic can't ask an American for help!

123
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,800
His grandmother was a quarter Italian.

124
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,909
Anyway, we've got to do something about Porco!

125
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,239
But ten per cent is outrageous!

126
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:30,590
When we sing of the time of the cherries, gay nightingales and mocking blackbirds will celebrate, pretty girls will have folly in their heads, Beautiful! pretty girls will have folly in their heads, pretty girls will have folly in their heads, and lovers, sunshine in their hearts.

127
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:45,600
When we sing of the time of the cherries, the mocking blackbird will sing better.

128
00:10:46,140 --> 00:11:19,240
But it is very short, the time of cherries, where some go to gather earrings in a dream, cherries of love in similar gowns falling beneath the leaves like drops of blood.

129
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:34,670
But it is very short, the time of cherries, coral pendants which one gathers in a dream.

130
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,719
He's here.

131
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,150
With his snout in the air, as always!

132
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:59,260
I will always love the time of the cherries, it's from those times that i hold my heart an open wound...

133
00:11:59,270 --> 00:11:59,434
Mr Porco Rosso?

134
00:11:59,454 --> 00:11:59,618
I'm from The Neptune. it's from those times that i hold my heart an open wound...

135
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,055
Mr Porco Rosso?

136
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:02,490
I'm from The Neptune.

137
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,755
Well done, sir!

138
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:07,020
I guess we won't see the Mamma Aiutos...

139
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,685
...for a while.

140
00:12:08,705 --> 00:12:10,270
I hear that bounties...

141
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,579
...might be a little bit higher this year...

142
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,255
Hey, you!

143
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:17,940
Put me down!

144
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:25,010
Listen quietly to the music.

145
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,724
She's quite a woman.

146
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:36,328
Even American pilots know Madame Gina at the Hotel Adriano.

147
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,169
Air pirates and bounty hunters alike leave their quarrels outside.

148
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,609
So that's the famous Curtiss parked outside?

149
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,650
'The Rattlesnake'.

150
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,700
Bringer of fame and fortune.

151
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,189
You beat Italians two years running for the Schneider Trophy.

152
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,719
It's not just fast.

153
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,789
It's good in a dogfight, too.

154
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,820
But I hear tell of a 'Porco Rosso' who's pretty famous, too.

155
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,916
Be careful of joining with the pirates, kid.

156
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:05,952
They're poor, they're cheap, and they're dirty.

157
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:08,988
They don't bathe.

158
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,069
That's true.

159
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,809
Who are you calling dirty, pig?!

160
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,479
Quite a distinguished gathering!

161
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,179
You boys must be planning something.

162
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,579
You're right!

163
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,519
Always glad to see you, but no war games here, OK?

164
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,910
We know, Gina.

165
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,310
We don't work within 50 kilometers of here.

166
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,729
We're even polite to the pig!

167
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,129
That's my boys.

168
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:41,790
Be seeing you.

169
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,839
Tell me what happened!

170
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,300
Next time we're alone.

171
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,259
That American's funny.

172
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:23,109
He took one look and said, 'Marry me! ' So I told him: 'I've married three pilots.' 'One died in the war, one in the Atlantic, and the third in Asia.' They found him?

173
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,630
I got a call today.

174
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,160
They found his remains in Bengal.

175
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,000
It's been three years.

176
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,550
I've got no more tears left.

177
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,120
The good ones all get killed.

178
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,690
To comrades.

179
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,805
Thanks, Marco.

180
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:53,920
You're always here for me.

181
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,979
You're the only one left from the old days.

182
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,419
One thing I don't like about this place.

183
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,389
That picture.

184
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,089
Don't touch it.

185
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:13,050
It's the only one of you when you were human.

186
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,420
The spell that changed you... how can we break it?

187
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:47,750
That American jerk is a good pilot.

188
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:16,390
Must be nice to make that much money.

189
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,089
This month's payment.

190
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,729
That pays off the loan on your plane.

191
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,600
How about making a contribution to the people with a Patriot Bond?

192
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:33,930
I'm not a 'person'.

193
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,779
Hello, Porco Rosso!

194
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,948
It's done!

195
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,729
Give me 60 bullets.

196
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,559
It's pretty crowded outside.

197
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,435
Yeah?

198
00:16:56,455 --> 00:16:58,320
Maybe the government's going to change again.

199
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,600
They'll pass a law against you guys.

200
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,239
Laws don't apply to pigs.

201
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,479
That's for sure... or moles like me.

202
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,635
Just regular bullets?

203
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:15,800
Not high- explosives, or armor-piercing?

204
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,119
Listen, kid, we're not fighting a war out there.

205
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,989
See you.

206
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,489
Thank you!

207
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,299
Hey, Boss... how is war different from bounty hunting?

208
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,705
War profiteers are villains.

209
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:35,120
Bounty hunters are just stupid.

210
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,925
We're air pirates!

211
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:39,760
We don't take out bank loans!

212
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,109
What else can we do?

213
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,009
These repairs were expensive!

214
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:51,740
Federation planes!

215
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,090
Why do we have to fly with a bunch of losers like this?!

216
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,129
It's all the pig's fault!

217
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,829
Can't those Mamma Aiutos even afford paint?

218
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,600
That is shabby!

219
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,380
It looks like everyone's here.

220
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,039
Hey, is the American here yet?

221
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,465
He's up in the sun!

222
00:18:14,485 --> 00:18:16,900
Right where he should be!

223
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:30,759
'Sighted target: The Mediterranean Queen. ' We're taking a ship that big?!

224
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,159
That's why we all got together!

225
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:39,300
'Having engine trouble.

226
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,450
Go first.

227
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,600
We will cover you.' 'That's a dirty trick!

228
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,750
We follow the plan! ' 'Then we share repair costs! ' 'You gutless wonder!

229
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,900
We pay our own repairs, just like always! ' 'Engine trouble!

230
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,050
Engine trouble! ' 'We settled all this before! ' All of you, shut up!

231
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:10,690
Attention all passengers: We are under attack... by air pirates.

232
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,655
There is no need for alarm.

233
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:16,560
We carry two advanced fighter aircraft.

234
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,440
We will now introduce our pilots.

235
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:27,540
Number 1: The Black Stallion, Signor Valleta!

236
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,810
Number 2: The Wolf of the Tiber, Flying Officer Visconti!

237
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,359
They've got muscle!

238
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:51,230
That wasn't in the deal!

239
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,439
Aw, what a mess!

240
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,349
Get away from me!

241
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:00,268
Curtiss!!

242
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,650
Right!

243
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,030
Let's go!

244
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,539
That's not good.

245
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:31,510
Guess I have to go to Milan.

246
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:35,870
... both pilots were shot down, but parachuted to safety.

247
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:41,390
The Pirate Federation looted the vessel and left this message: You're next!

248
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:46,410
Come and get us, pig!

249
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:54,574
We repeat... 'You're next.

250
00:20:54,594 --> 00:21:01,598
Come and get us, pig! ' Way to go, you turkeys!

251
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,800
Sorry.

252
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm on vacation.

253
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:12,820
White sheets, beautiful women...

254
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:25,620
Just get me to Milan, engine.

255
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,855
I don't like that weather.

256
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,170
I'll just have to go below the clouds.

257
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,754
Come on!

258
00:22:47,774 --> 00:22:50,938
You can do it!

259
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,720
That's right, engine!

260
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,500
Good boy!

261
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:11,290
Pig!

262
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,339
It's one against one!

263
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:24,740
Not right now!

264
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,019
I'll tell everyone you ran and hid!

265
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,399
Catch you later, yank!

266
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,929
Oh, damn!

267
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,999
Uh-oh...

268
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,039
Gotcha!

269
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,015
No, you didn't!

270
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:52,000
My engine quit!

271
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,890
Yes!

272
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,300
Now I'll be famous, too!

273
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,710
Yahoo!

274
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,780
I can't go back empty-handed, though.

275
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,700
They won't believe me without proof.

276
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,710
There!

277
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,640
That stupid red color... no mistake!

278
00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:02,640
A souvenir for my mama in Alabama!

279
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:48,210
Hurry, please.

280
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,700
Madame Gina!

281
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,050
There's a phone call.

282
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,150
He's safe.

283
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,180
He's alive.

284
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:04,930
Use the phone at the front desk.

285
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,316
Marco?

286
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:11,162
Are you all right?

287
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:13,008
I was just leaving to look for you.

288
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,210
Oh?

289
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,410
Good!

290
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,119
I've lost weight.

291
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,529
Two nights on a deserted island.

292
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,129
I'm taking the plane to Milan to get it fixed.

293
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,829
If that American comes in...

294
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,299
... tell him I'll be seeing him again.

295
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,909
Hey!

296
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:32,528
I'm not a messenger!

297
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:39,000
I worry about you, and you treat me like part of the furniture!

298
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,625
Someday you're going to be a pork roast.

299
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:46,510
I don't want to go to your funeral.

300
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,789
A pig's gotta fly.

301
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:56,850
Idiot!

302
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,139
I figured you'd be in tonight.

303
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,345
- I'm back.

304
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,560
- Messed it up again, huh?

305
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,660
- Why not just get a new plane?

306
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,760
- No, I like this one.

307
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,209
I know how you feel.

308
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,120
Look out...

309
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,040
I'll back her in.

310
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,759
Who's the little cutie?

311
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,489
My grand-daughter, back from the States.

312
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:22,760
Keep coming... keep coming...

313
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,989
What a beautiful plane, Grandpa!

314
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,089
It's got great lines!

315
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,150
There's no one now who can do work like that.

316
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,659
No resemblance.

317
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,765
- She's really your grand-daughter?

318
00:28:49,785 --> 00:28:51,880
- Hands off.

319
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,394
- Fio, lock up.

320
00:28:57,414 --> 00:28:59,428
- OK.

321
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,214
My opponent is Curtiss.

322
00:29:01,234 --> 00:29:02,998
I need another 15 knots.

323
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,230
Curtiss?

324
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,460
I haven't heard that name for a while.

325
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,990
- Well?

326
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,540
- Where did you get a Folgore?

327
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,759
Don't ask.

328
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,229
The Italian that Curtiss beat in 1927 for the Schneider Trophy had this engine.

329
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,054
But it wasn't the engine's fault.

330
00:29:25,074 --> 00:29:27,888
The mechanic was a fool.

331
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,599
This is exciting!

332
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,855
Don't fine-tune it too much.

333
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:34,120
It's not a race.

334
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,350
Tell me about it!

335
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,500
You're explaining Buddhism to Buddha.

336
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,219
Are you going to take all I have?

337
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,380
These days money's not worth the paper it's printed on.

338
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,550
Empty your pockets...

339
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,859
that's for the propeller, the paint...

340
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,629
That's for my hotel and my meals!

341
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,485
Stay here.

342
00:30:00,505 --> 00:30:03,350
I'll give you room and board cheap.

343
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,093
- Where are your sons?

344
00:30:05,113 --> 00:30:06,756
Are they good?

345
00:30:06,776 --> 00:30:08,419
- They're all away working.

346
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,169
- So who'll do the design?

347
00:30:10,189 --> 00:30:11,838
- Fio.

348
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,340
Fio?

349
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,840
That little girl?

350
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:20,180
She's young, but she's got something my sons don't.

351
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:29,820
We've been together a long time, but I think I'll try somewhere else.

352
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:37,230
Wait!

353
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,594
Are you worried because I'm a girl?

354
00:30:39,614 --> 00:30:41,328
Or because I'm young?

355
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,810
- Both, Miss.

356
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,290
- I can understand that.

357
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:51,819
Tell me... what's the main thing that goes to make a good pilot?

358
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,910
- Experience?

359
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,010
- No.

360
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,110
Inspiration.

361
00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:00,575
I'm glad you didn't say experience.

362
00:31:00,595 --> 00:31:06,040
Grandpa says you were very young when you first soloed... and that you were good even then.

363
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:10,570
It was in 1910... when I was 17.

364
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,580
17?!

365
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,530
I'm 17 now!

366
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,795
Let me try.

367
00:31:16,815 --> 00:31:19,060
I can't help being a girl, but we've got the old drawings.

368
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,079
If it's no good, you don't have to pay.

369
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,149
OK, Grandpa?

370
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,293
She's kin.

371
00:31:25,313 --> 00:31:27,446
She'll do fine.

372
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:29,599
I took apart my first engine when I was 12.

373
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,793
Sleep on this.

374
00:31:31,813 --> 00:31:33,406
We'll fix you a bed tomorrow.

375
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:35,019
Breakfast's at 7.

376
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:39,429
Good night.

377
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,955
You're still short, but we're old friends.

378
00:31:41,975 --> 00:31:44,490
Pay the rest later.

379
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,796
- Good morning.

380
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,052
Did you sleep well?

381
00:32:32,072 --> 00:32:33,308
- Did you work all night?

382
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,419
This is just rough.

383
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:40,090
We'll leave this part as it is, but use a different wing section.

384
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,259
That should give us five knots.

385
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,785
The old drawings were a surprise.

386
00:32:45,805 --> 00:32:48,320
The wings were single-structure.

387
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,260
The old drawings were a surprise.

388
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,130
Whoever did this really understood wood.

389
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,295
- I'm impressed.

390
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:59,830
- They only made one of these.

391
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,370
It was too dangerous to fly.

392
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,840
I found it in a warehouse.

393
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,833
I thought so.

394
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,756
The way the wings are set, - I'm surprised it even takes off.

395
00:33:10,776 --> 00:33:13,679
- Landings and take-offs are tricky.

396
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:17,600
They're better at high speed.

397
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,450
Tilt the wings back half a degree for me.

398
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,599
Leave the rest the same.

399
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,870
So you'll let me do it?

400
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,150
Thank you!

401
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,430
You won't be sorry.

402
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,015
But there's one condition, Miss.

403
00:33:31,035 --> 00:33:34,600
Don't work all night.

404
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,005
You don't do good work on no sleep.

405
00:33:37,025 --> 00:33:39,340
It's bad for your looks, too.

406
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,089
All right.

407
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:47,750
Actually, I was so nervous last night I couldn't sleep.

408
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,229
To tell you the truth, I was afraid you wouldn't let me do it.

409
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,605
I'm so happy!

410
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,990
I'll make some coffee.

411
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I sure hope she's not going to build it alone, too...

412
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:13,880
My niece Monica will do the drawings, my great-nephew's wife the finishing...

413
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,910
My cousin's daughters...

414
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,880
Sophia, Laura, Constance and Valentina.

415
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,015
Fio's sister Giliola.

416
00:34:20,035 --> 00:34:22,150
Sandra's her cousin.

417
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,099
Marietta, you've gotten so pretty!

418
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,030
My sons' wives Maria, Tina, Anna, and her sister Miletta.

419
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,869
Porcelino!

420
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,910
Grandma!

421
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,960
The angels haven't come for you yet?

422
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,819
You've grown up into a fine man!

423
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,249
You all work here, too?

424
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,380
To buy things for our great-grandchildren!

425
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:58,399
There's not one man here!

426
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,920
- They're all family?

427
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,450
- Yeah.

428
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,980
There's no work here.

429
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:07,170
The men are all gone away.

430
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,839
The depression...

431
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,180
Don't worry.

432
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,530
The women are tough and they work hard.

433
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:23,280
It's not pancakes we're making here...

434
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,359
Our Lord who art in Heaven...

435
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,760
We thank thee for giving our struggling company work and bread.

436
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:37,790
Forgive my sin of using women's hands to build a warplane.

437
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:46,040
Let's eat up and get to work!

438
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:59,210
That sounds good!

439
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,310
This engine was a good choice.

440
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,529
How do you like them RPMs?

441
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:12,600
Watch out or you'll blow the shed away!

442
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:20,510
Curtiss doesn't stand a chance.

443
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,569
Yeah, it's a good idea...

444
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,979
So can I do it?

445
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,470
Well... this is going to cost a lot more money.

446
00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:01,380
Look how far we are over budget already... and our customer...

447
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,929
Porco...

448
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,965
Don't look at me like that!

449
00:37:08,985 --> 00:37:11,010
Do whatever you like.

450
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,275
Great!

451
00:37:13,295 --> 00:37:15,460
I'll tell the workshop and we'll get to work!

452
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:21,369
Porco, I love you!

453
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,679
I can wait three months.

454
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,050
- Maybe I'll become a pirate.

455
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,430
- She's a good kid, huh?

456
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,479
Hands off.

457
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:38,880
That's the furthest thing from my mind.

458
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,565
- So you're a Squadron Leader now?

459
00:38:49,585 --> 00:38:51,610
- What did you come back for?

460
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,655
- I go where I want, Ferrarin.

461
00:38:55,675 --> 00:38:58,490
- The authorities won't like it.

462
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,129
- Are you being tailed?

463
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:01,698
- Yeah.

464
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,870
There are warrants out on you for treason, illegal entry...

465
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:10,910
...decadence, pornography and being a lazy pig.

466
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,615
It's not funny!

467
00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:18,550
They want to seize your plane, too.

468
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,460
- This is a lousy film.

469
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,310
- Come back to the Air Force, Marco.

470
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,455
- I could still get you in.

471
00:39:27,475 --> 00:39:30,520
- Better a pig than a Fascist.

472
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,139
Freelance daredevils are finished.

473
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:37,870
To fly now you need a government or an airline to pay you.

474
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,470
I only fly on what I earn myself.

475
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,989
Wherever you fly, you're still a pig.

476
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,430
Thanks, Ferrarin.

477
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,880
Say hello to the guys.

478
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,959
This is a good film.

479
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,770
Be careful.

480
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,590
They won't bother with a court of law.

481
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:06,120
See you, buddy.

482
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:24,980
Want a ride?

483
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:31,780
Thanks a lot.

484
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:38,270
I borrowed this to take the plane to the lake for tests tomorrow.

485
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,760
No time for that.

486
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,030
I've got to fly.

487
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,345
Don't be stupid!

488
00:40:43,365 --> 00:40:45,660
I'm not delivering an untested plane!

489
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,549
We can take it apart and get it to the lake in a day!

490
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,260
There's no time.

491
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,980
Take a careful look out the back window.

492
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,525
The Fascist Secret Police.

493
00:40:58,545 --> 00:41:00,840
They followed you.

494
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,320
- Me?

495
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,920
Why?

496
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,520
- 'Cause they're following me.

497
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:12,839
And you're fixing my plane.

498
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:20,009
Hey, are you really a spy?

499
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,570
Me a spy?!

500
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:27,140
Spies are a lot more serious than me.

501
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,365
But you were a war hero.

502
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:33,050
Why follow you if you've done nothing?

503
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:39,999
I agree!

504
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,285
Whoops!

505
00:41:43,305 --> 00:41:46,580
Wrong way.

506
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,979
I guess you did do something.

507
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:05,250
Time to get busy.

508
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,963
- It's ready to fly.

509
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:35,086
- There's two men out back and three - out front... this is so exciting!

510
00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:38,209
- Settle down, Grandma!

511
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:48,990
I'll see you.

512
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,579
What are you doing?

513
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,600
Making myself a place.

514
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,630
Give me five seconds.

515
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,219
What are you talking about?!

516
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:04,868
Don't be stupid!

517
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,683
- Shh!

518
00:43:06,703 --> 00:43:08,496
Don't shout!

519
00:43:08,516 --> 00:43:10,309
- Listen, Fio...

520
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:14,010
...you're a respectable woman.

521
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,110
Plus you're not married!

522
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,959
Hold this.

523
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,550
Thanks.

524
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:26,150
I had to rush to make this...

525
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,750
A perfect fit!

526
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,200
Hold that, will you?

527
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:34,465
Look, I'm a bounty hunter.

528
00:43:34,485 --> 00:43:37,730
I don't run tourist flights!

529
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,010
I want to get my first job right.

530
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,840
I can make adjustments as we go.

531
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:47,880
I'm taking off from the canal.

532
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,850
I might not even get airborne!

533
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,700
All the more reason to take me.

534
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,480
You'll need a mechanic against Curtiss.

535
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:01,530
I'm a male, and we'll be all alone on a deserted island.

536
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,785
Great!

537
00:44:02,805 --> 00:44:03,970
I love camping out.

538
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,249
That's not the point!

539
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,405
Take her along!

540
00:44:09,425 --> 00:44:11,570
If you don't beat Curtiss, we don't get paid.

541
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,849
If you don't pay, we go broke.

542
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,059
You're her grandfather!

543
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,080
I'll give you a break on her salary, and I'll throw in this voice tube.

544
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,827
- There'll be a price on her head, too.

545
00:44:23,847 --> 00:44:25,774
- No.

546
00:44:25,794 --> 00:44:27,721
I'll be your hostage.

547
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:30,805
We'll tell the police you forced us to help you.

548
00:44:30,825 --> 00:44:33,820
That'll be our excuse.

549
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,930
So please, take me with you.

550
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:37,960
I'll make myself useful.

551
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,949
Take out the right machine gun.

552
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:48,390
I don't care how small your bottom is, it won't fit between them.

553
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,109
Oh, great!

554
00:44:50,129 --> 00:44:51,778
My hips are bigger than they look.

555
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,629
Wait a second.

556
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:58,599
We'll leave now, before Grandma wants to come, too.

557
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,469
Hey, that's an idea!

558
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:04,939
Grandma, quick!

559
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:13,340
Please don't buy me anything!

560
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:24,040
Contact!

561
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:34,460
Open up!

562
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:43,670
Let go!

563
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,045
Kidnapper!

564
00:46:03,065 --> 00:46:07,410
Pay us our money!

565
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:12,283
- How's the rudder, Porco?

566
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:13,636
- Very rough!

567
00:46:13,656 --> 00:46:14,989
Like you!

568
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:19,949
Harder to handle than ever!

569
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,279
Stop and I'll fix it.

570
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:25,655
No time!

571
00:46:25,675 --> 00:46:29,040
I've got to get her up!

572
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,819
This water's like glue!

573
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,829
Ship ahoy!

574
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:41,629
Here we go!

575
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,339
Come on, baby!

576
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:44,659
The flaps are in the water!

577
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:45,988
Use your tabs!

578
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,829
- Tabs?

579
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:49,668
- They're new!

580
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,660
Quick!

581
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:07,810
That's right!

582
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:12,210
Now you're behaving!

583
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:45,285
Beautiful.

584
00:47:45,305 --> 00:47:49,020
The world is so beautiful.

585
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,289
Are they after us?

586
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:53,558
He's not attacking...

587
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,195
...but that's an Air Force plane.

588
00:47:56,215 --> 00:47:58,830
Ferrarin, I bet...

589
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,655
You know him?

590
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,540
The Air Force is waiting for us.

591
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:15,320
He'll show us a way through.

592
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:32,779
He says to go low and out to sea.

593
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,900
- Thanks, buddy!

594
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,030
- Thank you!

595
00:48:44,670 --> 00:49:23,305
Seeing you, he's probably thinking 'pearls before swine.' Beautiful!

596
00:49:23,325 --> 00:50:01,960
A single rose blooming in a secret garden.

597
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,224
Very rude.

598
00:50:06,244 --> 00:50:07,758
This is a private garden.

599
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:15,640
I just had to see you...

600
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,119
From Hollywood?

601
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:30,299
'In the matter of your starring in the script you have sent... ' 'Serious consideration' and 'please reply ASAP.' I call it Flower of the Adriatic.

602
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,299
Nice name.

603
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:32,900
You like it?

604
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,510
Then it's settled.

605
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:36,120
Gina, come to Hollywood with me.

606
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:43,110
Being a hired gun for air pirates is a mere step to fame and fortune.

607
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,979
The next step is Hollywood star.

608
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,749
And then?

609
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:53,970
President!

610
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,657
I'm serious!

611
00:50:58,677 --> 00:51:00,564
I'll make you the First Lady, Gina!

612
00:51:00,584 --> 00:51:02,471
I mean it!

613
00:51:02,491 --> 00:51:04,378
Gina!

614
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,197
- You're stupid.

615
00:51:06,217 --> 00:51:07,944
I like that in a man.

616
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:09,691
- Really?!

617
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,009
But I can't.

618
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:16,258
I'm gambling right now...

619
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:23,080
...that someone will visit me here, and I'll tell him I love him.

620
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,589
But the fool only comes to the club, at night.

621
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:35,820
He never comes out in daylight.

622
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:19,730
That jerk's come back!

623
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:21,320
Idiot!

624
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,879
He just kept on going.

625
00:53:27,899 --> 00:53:29,698
I lost my bet.

626
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,679
You mean you're betting on that jerk?

627
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,209
Can't I?

628
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:38,979
Life here is more complicated than where you're from.

629
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:42,160
You can fall in love again and again, but...

630
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,350
You go to Hollywood, kid.

631
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:51,399
'Kid'?!

632
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,099
I bumped my head when you did that roll!

633
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,229
Just saying hello to a friend.

634
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:00,599
Gina of the Hotel Adriano?

635
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,569
The woman in white on the terrace?

636
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,215
Grandpa told me.

637
00:54:06,235 --> 00:54:08,870
All the pilots in the Adriatic are in love with her.

638
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,179
He's got a big mouth!

639
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:13,924
What's she like?

640
00:54:13,944 --> 00:54:15,678
Are you in love with her, too?

641
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,430
I'm putting down.

642
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,180
Shut up or you'll bite your tongue.

643
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:25,450
Hey, wait!

644
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,949
A girl riding a fighter plane!

645
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,795
- Where's Porco?

646
00:54:51,815 --> 00:54:53,650
- Talking to my dad about something.

647
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,865
It's not just the caretaker government.

648
00:54:55,885 --> 00:54:58,080
It's the royalists, too.

649
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,199
They want to link up with the Pirates' Federation.

650
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,969
There's no money in chasing pirates any more.

651
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:06,945
- There.

652
00:55:06,965 --> 00:55:07,930
- Thanks.

653
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,939
All this talk about a depression!

654
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,979
You ought to sell your services somewhere, too.

655
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,919
A good pilot can make good money.

656
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:20,140
- Got any smokes?

657
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,370
- Curtiss'll go back to the States soon.

658
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:27,389
We're the ones who should go to America.

659
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,383
'Farewell to the days of fun and freedom in the Adriatic.' - Is that Byron?

660
00:55:31,403 --> 00:55:35,386
- No, me.

661
00:55:35,406 --> 00:55:39,389
See you.

662
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,739
Porco, it's terrible!

663
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:46,709
Their fuel's three times what it is back in Italy!

664
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,809
Give us a break!

665
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:51,030
We don't water our fuel here!

666
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:53,260
Man, girls are stupid!

667
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,585
- Talk to her, will you?

668
00:55:55,605 --> 00:55:57,830
- Pay him, Fio.

669
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,190
Then stuff that bigger-than-it-Iooks backside in with the machine gun.

670
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,115
- Off to the hideout!

671
00:56:05,135 --> 00:56:07,410
- I'm putting the fuel on your bill!

672
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:15,609
They're fair.

673
00:56:15,629 --> 00:56:17,728
We help each other when we need it.

674
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:22,110
It's pretty around here, but no one's got much money.

675
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:31,480
There's the island.

676
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:54,130
It's beautiful!

677
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,529
What a great hideout!

678
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:12,780
Agh!

679
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:17,040
My leg's gone to sleep.

680
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:30,490
- Look at all you silly idiots...

681
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:32,210
- Hey, Boss!

682
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,930
We got him!

683
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,609
Watch who you're stepping on!

684
00:57:36,629 --> 00:57:38,278
Move!

685
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,545
We've been waiting, pig.

686
00:57:40,565 --> 00:57:42,810
We knew you were coming.

687
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:45,729
We've got a score to settle.

688
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:48,969
He's got a girl with him!

689
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:49,969
She's pretty!

690
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,309
Shut up!

691
00:57:51,329 --> 00:57:52,658
So what?

692
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,110
- Half the world is women!

693
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:57,560
- That's not just any girl!

694
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,239
She's Piccolo's chief design engineer.

695
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:02,050
- A cute little thing like her?

696
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:04,870
- Are you sure?

697
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:08,749
My plane's a lot better than it was.

698
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:11,819
She's young but she's good.

699
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,489
Really, Porco?

700
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,935
I never lie about planes.

701
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:20,390
She's here to make sure I pay the bill.

702
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,769
You're in debt, too?

703
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:27,795
Serves you right!

704
00:58:27,815 --> 00:58:31,830
Bust that plane up so bad all he's got left is the loan on it!

705
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:35,380
You're going to take an axe to the plane I built?!

706
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,930
A plane as beautiful as that?!

707
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:42,019
It's a long story, Miss.

708
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,219
So you are!

709
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:45,525
Well, you know...

710
00:58:45,545 --> 00:58:47,840
And you call yourselves pilots?!

711
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:52,230
Move!

712
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:56,540
Where are my shoes?

713
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:02,800
I was raised on stories about seaplane pilots.

714
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:08,940
My grandpa always said there's no finer people.

715
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:13,420
Their hearts are washed clean by both sea and sky.

716
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,989
So they're braver than sailors...

717
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:21,989
...and prouder than regular pilots.

718
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,865
That's right.

719
00:59:23,885 --> 00:59:25,750
That's a seaplane pilot!

720
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:31,460
The most precious thing to them isn't money or women, it's honor.

721
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:33,037
- Yeah!

722
00:59:33,057 --> 00:59:34,544
That's right, Miss!

723
00:59:34,564 --> 00:59:36,051
- Hurray for seaplane pilots!

724
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:40,239
Oh, brother!

725
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,850
All right.

726
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:45,470
We won't take our axes and bust up the plane you built.

727
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:49,749
But honor won't let us just walk away, either!

728
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,019
Mince the pig!

729
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:53,564
Yeah!

730
00:59:53,584 --> 00:59:55,118
Make hamburger out of him!

731
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,129
Don't be so pig-headed!

732
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,285
You don't understand!

733
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:01,450
Haven't you any shame?!

734
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:04,569
You need an American to come and save you?

735
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,625
Your mothers would weep!

736
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,690
And tell you to take a bath!

737
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:13,570
Porco's come back to go one-on-one with Curtiss...

738
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,179
...for the honor of the seaplane pilots of the Adriatic!

739
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:19,235
A man without honor or scruples is nothing!

740
01:00:19,255 --> 01:00:21,300
Fight fair!

741
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:25,989
I always said we shouldn't hire Curtiss.

742
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:29,089
Stop trying to weasel out of things!

743
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,850
- What do we do, Boss?

744
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:32,620
- She makes sense.

745
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:35,329
We could lose face here.

746
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,855
- Should we talk to Curtiss again?

747
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:40,390
- Get him to fight again?

748
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,110
- The contract's expired...

749
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:45,760
- This is embarrassing!

750
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:54,019
It's Curtiss!

751
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:55,789
I heard you!

752
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:59,589
I don't run, and I don't hide!

753
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:08,120
What idiot put a path up there?!

754
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:20,639
Hold this for me.

755
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,049
So you want a return match?

756
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:26,010
But I already won once.

757
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:28,980
I'm no one's hired gun any more.

758
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:36,820
So what do you want?

759
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,899
Beautiful!

760
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:51,209
Will you marry me if I win?

761
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:52,809
I'm serious.

762
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,080
All right.

763
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,360
But if Porco wins, you pay his bills.

764
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:01,609
- Wait, Fio!

765
01:02:01,629 --> 01:02:05,248
- You keep out of it!

766
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:07,415
- Speak now or hold your peace, Miss.

767
01:02:07,435 --> 01:02:09,580
- It's up to him.

768
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:11,434
- This is expensive!

769
01:02:11,454 --> 01:02:13,218
- It's cheap!

770
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,569
Yes or no?

771
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:18,239
I'll gladly fight for the woman I love!

772
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20,079
Right!

773
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:21,928
Listen, all of you!

774
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:24,709
I like this girl's spunk!

775
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:29,370
The Mamma Aiutos will promote this fight!

776
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:36,319
Along with the Pirates' Federation!

777
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:41,659
See you later, Miss Fio!

778
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:43,929
You morons!

779
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,729
Don't forget to show up, pig!

780
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:49,729
Shut up and get out of here!

781
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:55,169
See ya!

782
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:59,800
Look what you've gone and gotten me into!

783
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:02,165
Don't be angry.

784
01:03:02,185 --> 01:03:04,460
I know it was stupid.

785
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:13,295
Fio...

786
01:03:13,315 --> 01:03:15,710
I've got to thank you, anyway.

787
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:18,659
You got me a chance.

788
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,634
Thanks.

789
01:03:20,654 --> 01:03:22,618
I guess fate meant for us to be a team.

790
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:26,639
So we're partners?

791
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:29,140
- My chances are only 50-50.

792
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,650
- I believe in you.

793
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:35,500
'Believe'...

794
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,370
I hate that word, but it sounds different coming from you.

795
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:46,275
What's the matter?

796
01:03:46,295 --> 01:03:48,310
You're not feeling well?

797
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:50,659
I'm fine.

798
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:53,865
My heart started beating so fast I couldn't breathe...

799
01:03:53,885 --> 01:03:57,080
I was really scared.

800
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:02,939
My knees are all wobbly...

801
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,179
Hey!

802
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:11,970
I'm going swimming!

803
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,899
Porco, we screwed up!

804
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:30,720
- How?

805
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:33,550
- We should have padded the bill!

806
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:37,280
- We blew it!

807
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:40,930
- You're right!

808
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,007
- Porco...

809
01:05:36,027 --> 01:05:37,364
- What?

810
01:05:37,384 --> 01:05:38,721
Can't you sleep?

811
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:42,510
I could've sworn...

812
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:44,730
Or was I dreaming?

813
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:48,200
Go back to sleep.

814
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:50,400
Tomorrow's an early day.

815
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,780
Porco... why did you turn into a pig?

816
01:05:54,860 --> 01:06:00,297
- Well, you know...

817
01:06:00,317 --> 01:06:05,754
- My father was in the same unit as a Flight-Lieutenant Marco Paggot.

818
01:06:05,774 --> 01:06:11,211
I used to love the story of how he jumped off a cliff in a storm... to rescue an enemy pilot.

819
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:19,379
Porco... shall I kiss you?

820
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:24,580
You know how the princess turned the frog back into a prince...

821
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,670
Don't be stupid.

822
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,700
Save your kisses for when you need them.

823
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,719
Maybe I'm not the one.

824
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:37,890
You're a good girl.

825
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:41,070
You make me think that all humanity's not a waste.

826
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:44,250
Now be a good girl and go to sleep.

827
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:48,739
Tell me a story, and I will.

828
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:52,365
A story?

829
01:06:52,385 --> 01:06:56,000
Let me see...

830
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:06,120
It was the last summer of the war.

831
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:12,290
We were on our usual patrol over the Adriatic, heading for Istria.

832
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:21,069
Berlini was beside me.

833
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:25,530
An old friend, who'd gotten married two days before.

834
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:30,209
I was best man at his wedding.

835
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:34,950
But we couldn't get leave, so we'd come straight back to base.

836
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,709
Planes were going down like flies, ours and theirs.

837
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,670
I had three on my tail.

838
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:04,640
I didn't have time for anyone else.

839
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:07,449
Then mine was the only one of our planes left.

840
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:10,170
The enemy kept coming.

841
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:12,900
They had blood in their eyes.

842
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,725
My hands and feet were numb, I couldn't see...

843
01:08:15,745 --> 01:08:18,470
I thought I was dead.

844
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,060
Suddenly everything all went white in front of me.

845
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,905
White?

846
01:08:25,925 --> 01:08:28,690
Yeah, like I was in pure light.

847
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:34,140
But a light so strange it took a while to realize I was in cloud...

848
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:38,670
I was so tired I didn't have enough strength to fly.

849
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:46,950
But the plane just kept flying by itself.

850
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,849
A cloud prairie?

851
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:13,719
Yeah, and dead quiet.

852
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:18,860
The sky was so beautiful...

853
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:24,010
With that weird line of clouds stretching up out of sight.

854
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:51,809
Berlini!

855
01:09:51,829 --> 01:09:54,808
You're OK?!

856
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:57,710
Berlini!

857
01:09:57,730 --> 01:10:00,610
Wait!

858
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:03,510
Where are you going?!

859
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:11,443
Berlini!

860
01:10:11,463 --> 01:10:12,756
Stop!

861
01:10:12,776 --> 01:10:14,069
What about Gina?!

862
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:21,070
I'll go instead!

863
01:10:56,090 --> 01:11:02,180
When I came to, I was flying all alone right down on the water.

864
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,899
God was telling you 'not yet'.

865
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:13,840
I felt like he was telling me just to keep on flying alone forever.

866
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:15,459
No, Porco!

867
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:17,028
You're good!

868
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,939
The good ones are the dead ones.

869
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:22,153
It might have been hell I saw.

870
01:11:22,173 --> 01:11:24,376
End of story.

871
01:11:24,396 --> 01:11:26,599
Go to sleep.

872
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:33,519
That junkyard sold me rusty bullets!

873
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:36,045
I'm glad you came back alive.

874
01:11:36,065 --> 01:11:38,580
I like you.

875
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:46,460
Good night!

876
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,289
Place your bets here!

877
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:12,520
If you're real men, put your money where your mouths are!

878
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,939
You'd think it was a carnival!

879
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:28,030
- They're all air pirates?

880
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:30,130
- The scum of the Mediterranean.

881
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:37,989
Gangsters, pirates, smugglers ...spies, plain-clothes cops, a few respectable citizens...

882
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:41,389
This is going to make me even more famous!

883
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:45,229
Ten minutes to start!

884
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:50,500
The showdown between Porco Rosso and Donald Curtiss is about to begin!

885
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:54,090
There's no rules.

886
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:56,990
The first one to run is a coward forever!

887
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:01,019
Shut up!

888
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:04,638
We came here for a dogfight, not speeches!

889
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:09,055
Shut up!

890
01:13:09,075 --> 01:13:13,470
Open your mouth and we shoot you!

891
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:20,359
A ten-ton bomb would be better.

892
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:24,820
This fight decides the fate of our beloved Miss Fio Piccolo...

893
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,939
...who needs no introduction!

894
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:28,540
Know what I mean?

895
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,150
A big hand for Fio!

896
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:31,760
Applaud!

897
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,039
Let's get this over with!

898
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:37,149
Quiet!

899
01:13:37,169 --> 01:13:39,268
There are formalities to observe!

900
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:47,180
Both sides will place their wagers!

901
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:48,785
- Miss...

902
01:13:48,805 --> 01:13:50,120
- Thank you.

903
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:54,699
Put it down!

904
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:56,820
No complaints?

905
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,950
All right, shake hands and come out flying!

906
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:01,360
Forget it.

907
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:03,690
Pigs are clean animals.

908
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:06,830
- That's not very friendly.

909
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:09,900
- We'll go straight to the church!

910
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,020
Don't worry.

911
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,100
My mother says you can get used to anything.

912
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:22,115
- May we have a picture?

913
01:14:22,135 --> 01:14:23,720
- We all took a bath!

914
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:28,000
- Smile, everyone!

915
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:32,280
- Smile!

916
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:52,489
Black wins if it's over in three minutes!

917
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:58,999
Maybe we could get them to do this every month!

918
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:05,369
Fifteen seconds to start.

919
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:08,669
That is so cool!

920
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,795
Five seconds...

921
01:15:09,815 --> 01:15:10,930
Four...

922
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:11,780
Three...

923
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,630
Two...

924
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:16,080
One...

925
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:19,530
Zero!

926
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:29,580
Curtiss has the height!

927
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,669
It's all Curtiss so far!

928
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:50,730
Gimme!

929
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:53,440
Come on, Porco!

930
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:54,910
Get above him!

931
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:57,275
He's a better target up high.

932
01:15:57,295 --> 01:15:59,640
He's harder to hit on the deck.

933
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:09,885
Don't worry!

934
01:16:09,905 --> 01:16:13,880
I've got lots of bullets!

935
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:26,406
- A barrel roll!

936
01:16:26,426 --> 01:16:27,742
The pig's on his tail!

937
01:16:27,762 --> 01:16:29,078
- A barrel roll?!

938
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:37,359
That trick made him 'the Ace of the Adriatic'!

939
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:43,450
Curses!

940
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:50,039
Now!

941
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:51,800
- He didn't shoot!

942
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,570
- Are his guns jammed?

943
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:56,970
He's not going to shoot until the very last.

944
01:16:56,990 --> 01:17:00,370
The pig's not a killer.

945
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:01,783
The American's still got plenty of ammo!

946
01:17:01,803 --> 01:17:03,126
Now!

947
01:17:03,146 --> 01:17:04,469
Shoot!

948
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,594
He didn't!

949
01:17:06,614 --> 01:17:08,648
What did I tell you?

950
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:11,289
If he shoots now, he'll hit the American.

951
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:15,990
He's going to wait till he can put two or three shots into the engine.

952
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:19,369
The damn fool thinks this isn't war!

953
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:21,369
Porco!

954
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,444
What's wrong with you?!

955
01:17:23,464 --> 01:17:25,528
Shoot!

956
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,630
Or are your guns jammed?

957
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:29,730
Too bad!

958
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:39,459
They're coming this way!

959
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:43,319
Come on!

960
01:17:43,339 --> 01:17:47,188
Fight like a pig!

961
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:48,440
Not this way!

962
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:49,690
No!

963
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:57,000
He ditched the pig!

964
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:10,619
Go fight somewhere else!

965
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:18,560
Look at those vapor trails!

966
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:23,660
This you only see once in a lifetime!

967
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:30,220
This is so moving!

968
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:38,349
If she doesn't hurry, she'll miss it!

969
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,755
- She won't come out of her room.

970
01:18:40,775 --> 01:18:43,170
- Are we going or not?

971
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:49,880
I want to see it!

972
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:59,152
'F to Gina of my heart: Warn pig... ' '... to stop fooling around.

973
01:18:59,172 --> 01:19:02,344
The Air Force is coming.' 'F'?

974
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:05,536
That's Ferrarin...

975
01:19:05,556 --> 01:19:08,728
Time to go!

976
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:30,785
- They're both really tough!

977
01:19:30,805 --> 01:19:33,620
- They're just getting warmed up!

978
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:41,939
Go, Porco!

979
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:47,930
You stupid pig!

980
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:57,120
You think you're going to have Fio?!

981
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:59,929
Now the pig's got his tail!

982
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:05,269
The finale!

983
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:08,439
Huh?

984
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:13,439
It's jammed!

985
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:17,949
The finish!

986
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:20,274
What the...?!

987
01:20:20,294 --> 01:20:22,608
Jammed!

988
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:24,360
What's the matter?

989
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,110
Out of ammo?

990
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:27,860
It's bent!

991
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,610
Fio's big butt!

992
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:35,020
- There aren't any ties in this game!

993
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,420
- This isn't a cowboy film!

994
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:42,709
What are you going to hit with that?

995
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:46,209
You jerk!

996
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:50,600
What good's that going to do?

997
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:55,000
Hi-ho, Silver!

998
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:02,429
You rotten pig!

999
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:05,359
Missed me!

1000
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:06,535
- Chicken!

1001
01:21:06,555 --> 01:21:07,720
- You ducked!

1002
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:09,470
- This is for love?

1003
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:11,220
- Shut up, pig!

1004
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:15,305
- Something's wrong.

1005
01:21:15,325 --> 01:21:19,390
- They're coming down!

1006
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:24,803
- They're back!

1007
01:21:24,823 --> 01:21:26,436
- Wait!

1008
01:21:26,456 --> 01:21:28,069
The prizes stay here!

1009
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:32,155
Stay back!

1010
01:21:32,175 --> 01:21:36,170
Stay back!

1011
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,529
You eat too much!

1012
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:47,590
Cowboy!

1013
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,069
Put 'em up!

1014
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:56,840
Go punch a cow!

1015
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:02,689
Come on, Porco!

1016
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:08,459
Get up, pig!

1017
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:14,980
That's dirty!

1018
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:35,442
- Uppercut!

1019
01:22:35,462 --> 01:22:36,674
Block!

1020
01:22:36,694 --> 01:22:37,906
- Yes!

1021
01:22:37,926 --> 01:22:39,138
Yes!

1022
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:40,660
Yes!

1023
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,110
The Federation can set up as bookmakers!

1024
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:49,599
Bring a bell!

1025
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,999
Can't you go faster?

1026
01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:52,524
No.

1027
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,058
The engine'll burn up.

1028
01:22:54,070 --> 01:23:01,900
Pilots are all crazy!

1029
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:06,320
Fio!

1030
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:10,040
Did you see that punch?

1031
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:13,119
I'll finish you in the next round!

1032
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:15,360
- Next round you go to sleep!

1033
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:17,610
- Stay in there!

1034
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:22,199
You're going to be brain-dead!

1035
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,669
Come on, pretty-boy!

1036
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:28,155
You're the pretty-boy here!

1037
01:23:28,175 --> 01:23:31,650
Chasing every girl you see!

1038
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,514
What about you?!

1039
01:23:33,534 --> 01:23:35,298
Who's it going to be, Fio or Gina?

1040
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:40,019
What?

1041
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:43,949
Stop hogging them!

1042
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:47,459
Gina...

1043
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:51,729
'Miss Gina' to you!

1044
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:59,539
Gina's in love with you!

1045
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:04,739
She sits in that garden...

1046
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:08,209
...and waits...

1047
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:16,700
...for you to come!

1048
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:19,479
- Porco!

1049
01:24:19,499 --> 01:24:20,548
- The bell!

1050
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:25,000
Start the count!

1051
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:29,450
Look at him!

1052
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:37,560
The Air Force isn't here yet.

1053
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:51,049
Try to psyche me out, will you?

1054
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:53,759
I don't get you!

1055
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:59,029
It's the truth!

1056
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:02,159
You won't get Fio!

1057
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:06,469
That's Gina!

1058
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:13,630
There's trouble!

1059
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,949
First one to stand wins!

1060
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:30,089
Coming through!

1061
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:35,629
No, Gina!

1062
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:38,190
Marco!

1063
01:25:38,210 --> 01:25:40,760
Can you hear me?

1064
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:48,930
Are you going to make another woman unhappy?

1065
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:57,119
Porco!

1066
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,189
Porco!

1067
01:25:58,190 --> 01:26:00,359
Thank you, Porco!

1068
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:07,850
It was nothing.

1069
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,429
OK, the party's over.

1070
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,840
The Italian Air Force is coming.

1071
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:16,260
Get out of here, everyone.

1072
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:18,410
Come to the club.

1073
01:26:18,430 --> 01:26:20,490
Drinks are on the house!

1074
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:25,510
We're out of here!

1075
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:38,729
It's over.

1076
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:40,369
Boss!

1077
01:26:40,389 --> 01:26:42,018
Hurry!

1078
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:46,139
There are formalities to observe!

1079
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:48,595
I hate the pig, but I like you.

1080
01:26:48,615 --> 01:26:51,060
Build some good planes. 'Bye!

1081
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:54,015
Thanks.

1082
01:26:54,035 --> 01:26:55,870
Take a bath sometime!

1083
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:58,309
Thanks, Mr Curtiss!

1084
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,235
Next time it won't be a bet.

1085
01:27:00,255 --> 01:27:02,170
I'll court you for real.

1086
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:03,805
Sure.

1087
01:27:03,825 --> 01:27:05,440
But I've made up my mind.

1088
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:07,125
- You ride in Gina's plane.

1089
01:27:07,145 --> 01:27:08,810
- No!

1090
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:11,110
I ride in your plane!

1091
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:13,410
We're partners, aren't we?

1092
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:19,300
Gina, take this girl back to the regular world.

1093
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:23,530
You always do this.

1094
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:26,100
It's not fair.

1095
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:29,915
Sorry.

1096
01:27:29,935 --> 01:27:33,730
Away you go.

1097
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:40,310
Take her up.

1098
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:09,419
Here comes the Air Force.

1099
01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:11,160
- Help me lead them away.

1100
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:12,910
- Hey!

1101
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:14,660
Your face!

1102
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,410
Wait!

1103
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,200
- Show me your face!

1104
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:19,920
- Your plane's over there!

1105
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:26,450
Just one look!

1106
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:33,509
Porco never showed up again, even after the Air Force did its sweep...

1107
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:41,040
... and I went back to Milan.

1108
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:47,450
But Gina and I became good friends...

1109
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:54,990
... and we still are, through all the war and turmoil there's been since then.

1110
01:28:57,370 --> 01:29:04,300
Now I run Piccolo Co., but I still summer at the Hotel Adriano.

1111
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:10,800
Gina is more beautiful every year, and there are lots of old faces.

1112
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:19,620
Oh, yes... 'Mr Curtiss' still isn't President, but he writes us...

1113
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:25,259
... saying he misses the good old days of that Adriatic summer.

1114
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:30,100
Whether Gina ever won her bet or not is our secret.

1115
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:54,020
Now, shall we talk about the old times?

1116
01:29:54,170 --> 01:30:17,765
The friends we often met at the store Along the road, rows of chestnut trees could be seen from the window One cup of coffee, all day long Recklessly searching for an unknown tomorrow Everybody had hopes The times we were shaken and blown by the hot wind We felt it with our entire being...

1117
01:30:17,785 --> 01:30:41,380
That's how it was.

1118
01:30:53,630 --> 01:31:20,820
Sometimes we all slept by the side of the road None of us could go anywhere We had no money, but somehow we lived Poorness carried tomorrow to us We barged into a small boarding house were rowdy until morning, and then slept Every day burned like a tempest I ran until I felt like dying...

1119
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:48,030
That's how it was.

1120
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:19,500
Look at the one remaining photograph...

1121
01:32:19,500 --> 01:33:08,290
You're the bearded man, aren't you Nowadays, there are many friends whom I have lost track of But I can't say to anyone That those days were completely in vain Even now you trace the same unfulfilled dream You're still running... somewhere...
