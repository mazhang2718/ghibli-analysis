1
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:29,530
Tokuma Shoten, Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Hakuhodo, Mitsubishi and Toho Present If you find yourself troubled by something mysterious...

2
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,780
or a problem that's hard to solve...

3
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,700
there's a place you can go...

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,040
a place where...

5
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,210
Oh no!

6
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,730
Haru, are you awake?

7
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,990
Just got up!

8
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,250
Good.

9
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,750
Morning.

10
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,250
Really...

11
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,460
Why bother to set your alarm clock?

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,010
Bye.

13
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,080
Aren't you having breakfast?

14
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,160
It's so delicious.

15
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,220
Oh, so delicious.

16
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,930
Not fair.

17
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,390
Bye.

18
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,580
My shoe!

19
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,500
Excuse me.

20
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,760
Oh no!

21
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,390
The Kingdom is now gone.

22
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,810
Yet the mountains and rivers remain.

23
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,440
The castle draped in the dense greens of spring.

24
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,060
Yoshioka.

25
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,240
You don't have time to sneak in.

26
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,430
Just get to your seat.

27
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
Yes, sir.

28
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,320
Caught again.

29
00:02:47,010 --> 00:03:04,270
The Cat Returns I hate this.

30
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,530
Late again and embarrassed in front of the whole class.

31
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,780
Machida-kun was laughing at me too.

32
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,200
He was laughing.

33
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,700
Why?

34
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,910
What's wrong with me?

35
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,290
Well, this must be a sign.

36
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,630
Something even worse is about to begin.

37
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,790
Thanks for the sympathy.

38
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,970
That's an unusual cat.

39
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,980
What's so great about Machida?

40
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,230
He's just so cool!

41
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,230
Have you told him that?

42
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,060
He seems to have a girlfriend.

43
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,690
She's a freshman and very good-looking.

44
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,690
So you already know.

45
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,160
In case you get dumped I'm ready to console you.

46
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,660
Thanks a lot.

47
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,120
I think Tsuge-chan is cool.

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,660
Good, if he dumps you...

49
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,550
Had something in his mouth.

50
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,500
Stolen goods?

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,420
Who knows...

52
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,430
What's he doing?

53
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,465
Hey, cat!

54
00:04:20,485 --> 00:04:22,510
Watch out!

55
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,555
Anyway.

56
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:27,260
It's just a cat.

57
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,780
Hey, that's dangerous.

58
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,240
Oh no, what's he doing?

59
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,200
Wait, Haru!

60
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,090
Good going Haru!

61
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,000
Hey!

62
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,250
Stop that truck!

63
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,600
Cat...

64
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,480
Are you OK?

65
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,000
Thank you for saving me from a dangerous situation.

66
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,500
I hope you haven't injured yourself.

67
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,630
Please excuse me, but I really must be going now.

68
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,640
Allow me to express my gratitude later.

69
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Don't mention it.

70
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,560
Haru!

71
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,320
Ah, you broke it.

72
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,360
Never mind, a cat's life is more important.

73
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,610
Did you see that?

74
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,300
Huh?

75
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,200
The cat bowed to me.

76
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:02,900
Haru...

77
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,690
Did you hit your head?

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,460
I'm home.

79
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,590
Don't step on that!

80
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,355
Sorry.

81
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,790
I can't decide which pattern to use.

82
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,260
Honey, can you make dinner?

83
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,180
Mom.

84
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,190
Can cats talk?

85
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,220
Well...

86
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,930
Let's see.

87
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,150
What?!

88
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,030
Come to think of it, you said so before.

89
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,990
Really?

90
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,000
When you were very small, you used to say "I can talk with cats."

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,370
Did I?

92
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,330
Yes, don't you remember?

93
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,230
What's wrong?

94
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,950
I see, you're hungry.

95
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,450
Do you like fish?

96
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,580
OK, take these.

97
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,000
You're so dirty...

98
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,580
Good?

99
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,170
OK, OK.

100
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,840
More?

101
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,840
Good girl.

102
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,090
Eat them all.

103
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,060
No need to thank me.

104
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,020
Haru.

105
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,900
Oh, Mom!

106
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,480
What were you doing?

107
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,570
Talking with a cat.

108
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,110
Remember I asked you what did you talk about with the cat?

109
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,660
Then you said, "She told me it's tough to make a living in this world."

110
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,660
and I thought it was so funny.

111
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,840
I guess that did happen.

112
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,760
Anyway, I'll get up early tomorrow in time for breakfast.

113
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,435
Uhm...

114
00:10:25,455 --> 00:10:26,330
Over here please.

115
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,220
A little closer.

116
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,150
Allow me to introduce.

117
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,530
The King of the Kingdom of Cats.

118
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,570
A King among Kings.

119
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,030
The Cat King.

120
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,450
That's me.

121
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:02,710
The cat you saved today was the son of the King, Prince Lune.

122
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:08,720
Given the importance of the matter, the King himself has come to show his gratitude.

123
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,775
Uh...

124
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:15,260
Mhh...

125
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,930
Thank you.

126
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,650
This is the program.

127
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:35,080
From tomorrow, countless joys will befall you.

128
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,960
Thank you.

129
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,460
See you.

130
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,700
A dream?

131
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,500
You're saying...

132
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,340
It really wasn't you who did this?

133
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,210
I have no idea.

134
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,470
Then who did it?

135
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,680
Haru!

136
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,350
Haru, hurry up!

137
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,480
What is this?!

138
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,070
Cattails!

139
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,725
Oh, I work too hard.

140
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:51,390
I'll be in bed today.

141
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,540
No!

142
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,210
Why?

143
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,840
Haru, it's this one, see?

144
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,703
Morning!

145
00:13:13,723 --> 00:13:14,246
Sorry.

146
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:14,789
Got to run.

147
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,350
What's she up to?

148
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,230
You think she has catnip?

149
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,155
Catnip?

150
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:24,090
Why?

151
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,020
Don't know.

152
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,995
Hey, Yoshioka!

153
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,310
Leave your cats at home.

154
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,530
They're not mine.

155
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,530
What is this?

156
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,330
It wasn't a dream.

157
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,290
It was those cats that did this.

158
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,250
Was it a mistake to save a cat?

159
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:20,760
Haru.

160
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,460
Wha...

161
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,170
What is it?

162
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,430
Did you get rid of the catnip smell?

163
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,190
Yeah.

164
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,380
It seems OK and the cats aren't after me anymore.

165
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,890
That's good.

166
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,440
Yeah.

167
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,520
Say, can I ask you a favor?

168
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,360
Can you take my turn for clean-up?

169
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,320
Tsuge-chan has a game today and I can't make it if I don't leave right now.

170
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,450
Please!

171
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,105
Oh...

172
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,190
Sure...

173
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,620
Clean-up, right?

174
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,170
Thank you, Haru!

175
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,435
Tsuge-chan!

176
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:02,160
Go for it!

177
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,960
Hurray Tsuge-chan!

178
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,130
You're so cool!

179
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,120
Be careful of the step.

180
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
Thanks.

181
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,050
Ouch, that hurt.

182
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,510
Oh no!

183
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,760
What a mess.

184
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,300
Uh oh.

185
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,440
What on earth am I doing here?

186
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,870
There you are.

187
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,310
Haru-sama, Haru-sama.

188
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,550
You cats!

189
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,200
One thing after another all morning.

190
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,460
We're glad you're pleased.

191
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,670
NOT!

192
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,970
Why is that?!

193
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:29,050
This project has been taken on by the whole kingdom to express our maximum gratitude!

194
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,640
What are you saying?

195
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,770
I don't eat mice.

196
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,390
I don't like cattails or catnip.

197
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,190
Oh, is that so...

198
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,360
Excuse our ignorance.

199
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,230
This is unexpected.

200
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,900
How shall I report to the King?

201
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,950
Sorry, did I hurt you?

202
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,320
Maybe I said too much.

203
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,910
To tell the truth, a lot happened to me recently.

204
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,370
Such as?

205
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,710
Such as many things.

206
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,670
I see, is that so?

207
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,720
Even a beautiful lady like Haru-sama has troubles.

208
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,500
Again...

209
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,420
That's enough.

210
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,100
No, it isn't enough.

211
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,970
We can't stop now.

212
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,730
We'll do our best to make you satisfied.

213
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,440
You have more?

214
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,650
Yes.

215
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,610
Please come visit us in the Kingdom of Cats.

216
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,150
The Kingdom of Cats?

217
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,700
It's a nice place.

218
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,780
Lots of natural scenery and good food.

219
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,500
The whole Kingdom will welcome Haru-sama.

220
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,420
And what's more...

221
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:48,840
The King is expecting Prince Lune, who you saved yesterday, to welcome Haru-sama as his bride.

222
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,520
No way!

223
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,210
That's impossible.

224
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,350
The Prince is a cat.

225
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,980
What's the problem?

226
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,650
He is a cat, but he's cool!

227
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,650
Cool?

228
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,660
Well...

229
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,580
A kingdom of cats might be good.

230
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,130
Just laying around all day.

231
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,300
Exactly!

232
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,960
It might be heaven.

233
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,260
Eat tons of great food, then have a nap.

234
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,890
Forget all your troubles...

235
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,130
But a cat's bride...

236
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,380
That's going too far.

237
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,350
Even if he is a prince, that's...

238
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:38,890
Huh?

239
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,100
Well then, we'll come for you tonight.

240
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,980
What do you mean?

241
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,390
Hey!

242
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:46,810
Wait!

243
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,780
Ouch.

244
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,990
That really hurts.

245
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,200
Wait, give me time to think.

246
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,040
That is to say... in a word...

247
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,465
What can I do?

248
00:19:00,485 --> 00:19:01,900
I'm sure those cats will do it.

249
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,870
They'll take me to the Kingdom of Cats.

250
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,000
They'll make me the cat's bride.

251
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,290
No, no.

252
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,540
No!

253
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,790
Never!

254
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,720
Haru-chan.

255
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,060
Haru-chan.

256
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,060
Who is it?

257
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,230
Haru-chan, the Cat Business Office.

258
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,150
Find the Cat Business Office.

259
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,020
Not this.

260
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,110
Who is this?

261
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,990
What is the Cat Business Office?

262
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,990
I'm sure they'll help you.

263
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,990
A large white cat at the Crossroad will show you the way.

264
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,330
A large white cat...

265
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,170
Haru-chan, go to the Crossroad and find the Cat Business Office.

266
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,350
Never heard of the Cat Business Office.

267
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,530
A large white cat...

268
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,145
But the voice was beautiful.

269
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:18,020
Might be a nice white cat.

270
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,410
Oh, I'm tired.

271
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,920
I'm taking a break.

272
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,300
What?

273
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,530
What is it?

274
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,210
What's this big fat cat?

275
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,510
What are you doing here?

276
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,970
A large white cat!

277
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,010
Is this it?

278
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,900
Hey, you.

279
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,170
Do you know the Cat Business Office?

280
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,940
I need your help.

281
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,120
I mistook you for a different person...

282
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,850
Ehh, a different cat.

283
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,660
I'm sorry I sat on you.

284
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,660
Follow me.

285
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:04,950
You are the one.

286
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,750
Hey, wait for me!

287
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,860
Hey, isn't there an easier way?

288
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,030
Is this revenge?

289
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,160
Because I said you're fat?

290
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,820
What a strange place.

291
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,900
Where's the Cat Business Office?

292
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,280
Are you listening?

293
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,120
I have a big problem.

294
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,710
These cats are taking me to their kingdom!

295
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,800
Is... this...

296
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,860
Hey, Baron!

297
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,940
You got a visitor!

298
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,090
Cut the theatrics and just come out!

299
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,610
Welcome to the Cat Business Office!

300
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,370
Cool...

301
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:07,660
This place is in a dimension a little different from yours, a world for beings who have souls.

302
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:16,760
When people create something with all their heart and hopes, the creation is given a soul, like me and him.

303
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,140
Oh my gosh!

304
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,570
He is Toto.

305
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,010
A gargoyle with a soul.

306
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,400
Baron, it's quite rare for you to have a visitor.

307
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,990
Yes, and a quite charming one, don't you think?

308
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,660
Baron?

309
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,660
I'm Baron Humbert von Gikkingen.

310
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,290
The person who created me named me so.

311
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,290
So that's why you're called Baron.

312
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,500
I heard your story.

313
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,250
Trouble with some cats from the Cat Kingdom?

314
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,340
That's right.

315
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,010
I saved a cat from being run over.

316
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,890
Now they're saying, in return, they want to take me to their kingdom.

317
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,800
In return?

318
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,140
Heh, it figures.

319
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,810
Too kind for your own good.

320
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,940
You shouldn't have bothered.

321
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,270
Your mind is nasty as ever.

322
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,940
You can't appreciate the kindness which saved a cat.

323
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,530
And she is in trouble for it, right?

324
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,620
Never mix in somebody else's business.

325
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,040
Where did you meet this girl?

326
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,500
At the Crossroad place.

327
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,790
She already knew about this place.

328
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,780
Hmm.

329
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:39,590
Uh, I heard a voice, though I don't know who it was.

330
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,340
A voice?

331
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,930
You listened to some strange voice?!

332
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,775
How naive can you get...

333
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:44,630
Yeow!

334
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,260
What are you doing?

335
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,300
Why don't you hold your tongue!

336
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,430
You stay out of this!

337
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,270
Don't fight because of me...

338
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,980
You said your name was?

339
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,345
Oh, it's Haru.

340
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,720
My name is Haru.

341
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,020
Okay, Haru.

342
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,020
Please do come in.

343
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,740
Don't worry about them.

344
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,700
You lousy black bird!

345
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,290
Don't you even know I'm a crow?

346
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,500
Come out from the dark, you fowl!

347
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,630
Nobody can miss a giant marshmallow like you!

348
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,750
You big hog of a cat!

349
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,710
Go get fried, chicken wings!

350
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,090
Shut up, moo shoo pork!

351
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,090
Pollo loco.

352
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,930
I'm coming in.

353
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,940
Whoa...

354
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,380
This place is gorgeous.

355
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,650
Now, do come in and have a seat.

356
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,440
Thank you.

357
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,070
Any lemon or milk with your tea?

358
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,190
Milk, please.

359
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,580
You have a beautiful office.

360
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,120
Here you are.

361
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,330
Thank you.

362
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,460
Cute.

363
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,090
It's my special blend.

364
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,630
Can't guarantee the flavor though, it's different each time.

365
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,810
This is good!

366
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,140
This is really good.

367
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,770
Then, you're lucky.

368
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,020
How can you drink green leaves?

369
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,110
Too refined for your tongue, I bet.

370
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,190
Go catch a worm, bird.

371
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,280
Muta...

372
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:28,950
Tell me about the Kingdom of Cats again.

373
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:34,750
That whole place is fake, a place for those who don't have a mind of their own.

374
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,210
Mind of their own...

375
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:42,210
One of the Cat King's men said they want me to marry their Prince...

376
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,620
Why not?

377
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,700
A cat's bride?

378
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,920
What?!

379
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,590
Might not be so bad.

380
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,220
This is going nowhere.

381
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,100
Could be an interesting experience.

382
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,430
I see.

383
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,520
I did want to visit the Kingdom of Cats once.

384
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,270
This might be a good opportunity.

385
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,890
How brave of you, Baron.

386
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,520
But I think I'll give it a miss.

387
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,240
You are coming with me.

388
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,790
No, thanks.

389
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,350
It's not my territory.

390
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,370
You're not taking her, are you?

391
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,580
That won't be wise.

392
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,410
But I can't leave her here all alone.

393
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,880
Babysitting isn't my thing either.

394
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,920
Are you busy?

395
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,340
Not really.

396
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,510
Um, I think I'll go home.

397
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,760
I'm just making trouble for all of you.

398
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,770
I started all this mess.

399
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,890
I have to solve this myself.

400
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,810
I see.

401
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,530
I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help.

402
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,480
Okay.

403
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,270
Okay, I'll do it.

404
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,870
I'll just hang around for a while.

405
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,160
You're a good cat, Muta!

406
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,200
It's set then.

407
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,000
Haru, you can come back now.

408
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,250
But...

409
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:05,460
Muta complains a lot, but doesn't actually mean it.

410
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,510
I see.

411
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,720
He is actually nice then.

412
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,340
That's right.

413
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,640
I'm not listening.

414
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,640
Thank you for your help.

415
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,600
Buta-san.

416
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,553
Bu?

417
00:30:20,573 --> 00:30:21,846
Did you say Bu?!

418
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:23,139
Note: "Bu" is a reference to his overweight You said it on purpose, didn't you?!

419
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,940
I'm sorry, it wasn't on purpose!

420
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,860
This girl is not bad.

421
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,570
No way I am going to help!

422
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,860
Didn't we have some delicious chiffon cake in the cupboard?

423
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,200
Where?

424
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,120
On the upper right shelf.

425
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,580
Why didn't you say so.

426
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,750
Let's have a piece before we start.

427
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,500
I'll go get my special mulberries then!

428
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,010
It seems like this is going to be fun.

429
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,930
Let me help too.

430
00:30:54,180 --> 00:31:00,770
Haru, you need to think about how you can learn to be yourself.

431
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,150
Then, you should have nothing to fear.

432
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,360
Okay.

433
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,943
Baron!

434
00:31:06,963 --> 00:31:08,126
Give me a hand.

435
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:09,309
I'm putting some whipped cream on top.

436
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,820
We're really going full-scale.

437
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,450
Of course we are.

438
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,160
Maybe I'll find something here.

439
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,330
Yes.

440
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,660
Is that Toto-san at the door?

441
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,270
Haru-sama, we have come for you.

442
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,170
No!

443
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,930
What is this?

444
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:39,970
Not good.

445
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,900
You promised to help me!

446
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,520
Baron, horde of cats headed this way.

447
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,530
You're blind as a bat!

448
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,440
After them!

449
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,450
Haru-sama, we looked all over for you!

450
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,160
I'm going home.

451
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,500
Careful!

452
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,180
Let me off!

453
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,870
Take me back!

454
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,210
I am going back, this instant!

455
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,470
You must be having pre-marriage blues.

456
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,840
I am not!

457
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,970
Things got a bit out of hand.

458
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,270
Hey, you, wait, ouch, let go!

459
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,650
Muta-san, and Baron!

460
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,650
Let go, I'm telling you!

461
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,400
Toto, now!

462
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,360
Don't let go!

463
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,030
Why did we get out of the way!

464
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,330
No choice.

465
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,410
I'm really mad now!

466
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,040
Yay!

467
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,790
This is over the weight limit!

468
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,650
Toto!

469
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,800
I see it.

470
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,320
Where are you going?!

471
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,110
Out-maneuvered.

472
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,040
Go up.

473
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,200
OK.

474
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,340
Now what?

475
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,525
The wind.

476
00:33:43,545 --> 00:33:44,590
Follow the lights.

477
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,810
OK!

478
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,780
Ouch...

479
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,700
I landed on my back...

480
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,950
Why?

481
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,700
Where am I?

482
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,725
Muta-san?

483
00:34:15,745 --> 00:34:17,040
Did you get bigger?

484
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,970
No, you got smaller.

485
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,340
Why?

486
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,810
Because we're here.

487
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,650
This is the Kingdom of Cats?

488
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,260
This is it.

489
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,450
Wow, cats really live here.

490
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,910
Well, this is their kingdom, you know.

491
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,910
Hey, come on.

492
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,920
Ahh, it's so nice and relaxing here.

493
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,630
We should find a way out and go back.

494
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,550
Just a little longer.

495
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,760
Let's get going.

496
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,510
But... it feels so nice.

497
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,940
No!

498
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,130
You must go back at once.

499
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,570
Hurry.

500
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,550
Run away!

501
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,040
Hey, what a pretty cat.

502
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,160
Even the cats are prettier here.

503
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,710
Please, you have no time to lose!

504
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,840
Haru-chan, you are not meant to be here.

505
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,300
Why do you know my name?

506
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,840
Haru-sama!

507
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,470
It's that cat again.

508
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,810
I am so relieved to find you.

509
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,890
Seems we dropped you when coming in.

510
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,940
Your servant exceeded our weight limit.

511
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,150
Servant?!

512
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,350
No, no.

513
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,560
This is Muta-san.

514
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,015
Shall we?

515
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:37,170
A banquet is being prepared in your honor.

516
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,320
You are welcome to join us, Buta-sama.

517
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,505
Bu...

518
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:40,320
Bu?!

519
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,950
But I...

520
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,540
His Majesty is waiting at the palace.

521
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,330
Palace?

522
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,460
The palace is right over there.

523
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,840
Oh, really.

524
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,920
Yes, indeed.

525
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,165
Hey.

526
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:55,330
You're not thinking of...

527
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,970
Maybe it's rude not to greet the King first.

528
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,390
Are you out of your mind?

529
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,100
Please, this way.

530
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,310
Wait.

531
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,440
Can she come with us?

532
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,560
What is your name?

533
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,260
My name is Yuki.

534
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,470
I serve at the royal table.

535
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,400
So you work at the palace.

536
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,200
Haru-sama, you'll see her later.

537
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,410
Okay, I'll see you again.

538
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,580
Haru-chan.

539
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,185
What's that?

540
00:37:57,205 --> 00:37:58,230
Creepy!

541
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:08,040
There's my future daughter-in-law.

542
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,300
Well, I must go see her in person!

543
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,850
He's strangely familiar.

544
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,360
Please change before meeting the King.

545
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,860
I need to change clothes?

546
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,370
Please wait in the next room.

547
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,910
Why can't I go in with her?

548
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,860
Don't be gross.

549
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,620
Gross?

550
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,580
We prepared refreshments for you.

551
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,540
Okay, I'll wait.

552
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,430
Not bad.

553
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,310
The dress is very becoming on you.

554
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,100
Prince Lune is the idol of all female cats in this Kingdom.

555
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,850
You'll be very happy with him.

556
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,810
Really?

557
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,615
I mean, no.

558
00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:17,430
That's not why I'm here.

559
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,450
You look lovely.

560
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:25,240
You are the purrfect bride for Lune.

561
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,600
Natoru, who is that cat?

562
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,770
A servant named Buta-sama, I believe.

563
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:50,680
Buta?

564
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,060
Never heard of him.

565
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,570
No match for my stomach.

566
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:10,290
Um, I am sorry, but I can't really accept marriage to...

567
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,170
I thought you already said yes?

568
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,790
That was what I was told.

569
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,130
Where is the Prince?

570
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,550
He is away at an official function.

571
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,550
Anyway, I don't really know him.

572
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,810
And the Prince, he is a cat, right?

573
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,390
I'm not a cat, so I can't marry him.

574
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,980
That, you don't need to worry about.

575
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,150
You already are a cat.

576
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,670
Wow, real cat ears.

577
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,340
I'm a CAT!

578
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,340
Muta-san!

579
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,060
What happened to him?

580
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:20,020
He insisted on having a bowl full and dunked himself in catnip jelly.

581
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,940
He didn't have to die like this!

582
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,360
Muta-san, how could you do this to me?

583
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,580
The banquet is ready to begin.

584
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,550
No!

585
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,530
I don't want to leave him.

586
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,790
Then, he will come with us.

587
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,090
Is this Haru-sama?

588
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,140
She has a perfect pair of ears!

589
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,180
Such full attractive paws!

590
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:03,780
I was told you don't like mice, so I have prepared fresh fish for you.

591
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,850
Haru doesn't seem pleased.

592
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,050
What do we have for entertainment?

593
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,490
I will bring them in.

594
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,550
I want something more amusing.

595
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,810
Next!

596
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:49,550
Can't you do anything better?!

597
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,860
I shall amuse Haru-sama.

598
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,320
What should we do?

599
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,230
Why not?

600
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,170
Shall we dance?

601
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,540
I can't dance meow.

602
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:32,130
Oh no, I even sound like a cat!

603
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,550
Trust me.

604
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,350
They dance well together.

605
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,950
What is this...

606
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,410
I never felt like this before.

607
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,870
Being a cat might not be that bad.

608
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,300
No, Haru.

609
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,820
Don't lose yourself.

610
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,050
You must learn to be yourself.

611
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,180
I already told you that, didn't I?

612
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,930
You are...

613
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,480
Stop this music!

614
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,290
You suspicious cat.

615
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,700
Exactly who are you?

616
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,170
Apologies for my belated introduction.

617
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,260
There is nothing to fear.

618
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,680
I am Humbert von Gikkingen.

619
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,230
I have come for Haru.

620
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,350
Baron!

621
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,100
Can this be?

622
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,850
What?

623
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,150
No way.

624
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:53,980
Guards, get him!

625
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,370
I can't eat anymore.

626
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,080
It's alive!

627
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,250
I'm glad, you're alive, Muta-san.

628
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,460
Uh oh.

629
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,170
Stop, you scoundrel!

630
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,340
Take His Majesty to a safe place!

631
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,640
Don't let him get away.

632
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,520
Guests' emergency exit this way.

633
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,860
Out of my way!

634
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:39,955
Muta-san.

635
00:47:39,975 --> 00:47:40,600
You're strong!

636
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,450
I didn't start it.

637
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,330
This way.

638
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,660
You're the cat from before...

639
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,330
Baron, I knew you would come.

640
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,670
How do you know me?

641
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,420
I've heard about you and your Office.

642
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,050
If I had listened to you, this wouldn't have happened.

643
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:07,510
If you leave before dawn, you can still become human.

644
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,680
Really?

645
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,140
A secret passage to the outside.

646
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,190
This is convenient.

647
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,920
What about Muta-san?

648
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,525
He'll be all right.

649
00:48:24,545 --> 00:48:25,570
Hurry, Haru.

650
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:26,570
Yes.

651
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,040
This is the back of the castle.

652
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,090
The top of that tower leads to the exit.

653
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:44,300
It's so tall!

654
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:48,010
You must go through the ruins to the tower and then climb up.

655
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:49,760
We'll make it.

656
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:51,840
Good.

657
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,550
Please take care of Haru-chan.

658
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,810
Wait.

659
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,545
She is gone.

660
00:48:57,565 --> 00:48:59,310
I haven't even thanked her yet.

661
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,980
Haru, this is just my guess.

662
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,030
But isn't she the one who led you to me?

663
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,710
Haru-chan.

664
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:09,980
The Cat Business Office.

665
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:13,830
Yes, that beautiful voice was hers.

666
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:14,660
But why?

667
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,140
Because of you, I almost died.

668
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,770
We must hurry now.

669
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:33,470
Right.

670
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,520
You guys, listen to me.

671
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:44,190
Did they go in?

672
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

673
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,490
Purrfect.

674
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,530
That labyrinth was built with our state-of-the-art technology.

675
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,450
We'll enjoy the view from here.

676
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,620
Tricky.

677
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,080
The sun is still high, though.

678
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,700
It's always daytime here.

679
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,630
What?

680
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:03,490
It is?

681
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,760
It's probably past midnight outside.

682
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,470
Then, we have to hurry!

683
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,795
This way?

684
00:50:09,815 --> 00:50:11,130
That way?

685
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,970
Which way should we go?

686
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,100
They are lost.

687
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:20,560
It won't be easy to get out of there.

688
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,480
Right, Your Majesty?

689
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:23,725
Yes...

690
00:50:23,745 --> 00:50:24,560
We have nothing to worry about.

691
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,150
Where are the soldiers?

692
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:27,240
Over there.

693
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,820
Let's go this way.

694
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,120
We must keep trying, one by one.

695
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,250
Keep your eyes on the tower.

696
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,750
You won't lose your way.

697
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,170
Smart.

698
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,250
Muta-san, you're cheating.

699
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,250
Why get lost just 'cause it's a maze.

700
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:46,420
There he is!

701
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,550
Why does it have to be me?

702
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,970
Let's hurry while he keeps them busy.

703
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:55,600
Right.

704
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,270
Why do I have to be the bait?!

705
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:13,620
Get back, Haru!

706
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,840
You're strong!

707
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,340
Your cane got bent?

708
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,310
I was going to buy a new one anyway.

709
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,520
Used is best.

710
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,170
Nice shot!

711
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:54,640
It hit one of ours!

712
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,890
What?

713
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:58,190
Your Majesty, how could you?

714
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,100
Don't tell anyone, okay?

715
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,360
Excuse me, sir.

716
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,280
Our men are all scattered.

717
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,530
They are all lost.

718
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:08,570
Where is Haru-chan?

719
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:12,490
They already got that far!

720
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,490
Hi!

721
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:16,700
Welcome back.

722
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,750
How's that way?

723
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:18,920
It's a dead end.

724
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:38,480
Everything as planned.

725
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,300
Is this another dead end?

726
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,140
It's getting more difficult.

727
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,215
Something's wrong!

728
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:50,720
There was no wall here a minute ago.

729
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,310
It must be your imagination.

730
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,980
No, we walked through here.

731
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,530
Are you saying that walls have feet?

732
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,240
This is no wall.

733
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,320
It's fake.

734
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:17,210
See?

735
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,750
Good work, Haru!

736
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,090
What is all this?

737
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:25,720
I told them not to get in line!

738
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:30,930
They are getting away!

739
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,730
Your Majesty, wait!

740
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,395
Go ahead.

741
00:53:42,415 --> 00:53:43,560
I'll catch up with you.

742
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:49,870
Show off!

743
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:52,710
No, Baron...

744
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:53,370
Don't worry!

745
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,140
Your Majesty, please, it's dangerous.

746
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,560
I can't let this happen!

747
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:21,150
I have soldiers waiting in the tower, just in case.

748
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:25,610
Brilliant move!

749
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,000
Good, good.

750
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:49,300
I'm afraid the tower's getting old...

751
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,310
This is not good at all!

752
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:55,430
We have no choice, but use THAT.

753
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,530
What?

754
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,640
No, not that!

755
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,730
If you do that, Your Majesty, your image will go to shambles.

756
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,020
Give me the button!

757
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,110
There is no such thing here.

758
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:05,440
Here's the remote control.

759
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,910
Yay, we came out to an opening.

760
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,200
Just a bit more.

761
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:17,790
Now!

762
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:24,300
What?

763
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,090
Hold on!

764
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,150
That was a great spectacle!

765
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,990
Let's go!

766
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:52,880
We're back on the ground.

767
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,660
Let's see how things go.

768
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,370
We have no choice.

769
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,130
Come on, come on.

770
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:08,090
Gikkingen-kun, nice to see you again.

771
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,895
Haru-chan!

772
00:56:09,915 --> 00:56:11,710
We'll go back to the castle right away.

773
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,850
Being a cat is not so bad.

774
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:17,560
Do I have to learn to like mice?

775
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,600
It's too early to give up.

776
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,750
What's all this?

777
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:41,580
Father!

778
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:46,710
Lune, you're back already?

779
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,830
His Highness the Prince!

780
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:48,960
As you were!

781
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,720
Prince?

782
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:59,480
I hurried back, thanks to Yuki-chan.

783
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,940
What is all this?

784
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,400
Haru-chan.

785
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:06,110
Oh, we meet again.

786
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,860
I'm glad we made it.

787
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,400
Err, I just wanted to thank her.

788
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:17,030
I thought you'd be happy to have Haru-chan as your bride.

789
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:19,330
You don't need to worry about me.

790
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:21,370
I want to marry Yuki-chan.

791
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,630
What?!

792
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,460
Looks like news to everyone.

793
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,880
This Prince is not bad.

794
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,510
Yuki-chan, look.

795
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,060
I went to your old home to find this.

796
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:47,440
Oh, could this be what I think it is?

797
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:49,305
Those cookies...

798
00:57:49,325 --> 00:57:51,180
I used to love those.

799
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:52,320
That's right.

800
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:56,950
These are the fish cookies you gave me when I was an orphan kitten.

801
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:59,620
That kitten, that was you!

802
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:03,580
You're so beautiful now that I didn't recognize you.

803
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,750
Yuki-chan.

804
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:09,920
Will you accept these as a token of our life together from now on?

805
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,340
That means...

806
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,090
You two are getting married?

807
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:22,180
Oh, I am so happy for you, Yuki-chan!

808
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,900
Thank you, Haru-chan!

809
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:29,480
If I hadn't met you then, I could have starved on the streets.

810
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,690
You also saved me from danger.

811
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:36,610
I didn't know you were the person Yuki told me so much about.

812
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:39,080
You saved both of our lives.

813
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,620
How can we thank you?

814
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:42,580
I don't want anything.

815
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,000
You two made me so happy already.

816
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,710
Saving a cat was a good thing.

817
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,420
This is such a moving sight.

818
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,590
So you already had a fianc?
