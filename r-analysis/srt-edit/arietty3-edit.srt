3
00:00:44,074 --> 00:00:57,242
Feeling all right?

4
00:00:57,376 --> 00:00:58,709
Yes.

5
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:34,876
Directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi THE SECRET WORLD OF ARRIETTY Haru...how many times have I told her?

6
00:01:36,094 --> 00:01:37,199
- I'll be right back.

7
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:38,324
- Okay.

8
00:01:44,344 --> 00:01:46,491
Haru!

9
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:48,658
You're blocking the driveway again.

10
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:17,709
Sho?

11
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:19,959
Where are you?

12
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:36,876
Don't touch!

13
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:40,793
These aren't for you.

14
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,137
- Arrietty!

15
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:04,158
- What?

16
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:07,168
You went outside again, didn't you?

17
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,834
And you might clean up this room, young lady.

18
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,668
It's my own little garden.

19
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:16,459
If you ask me, it looks like a mess.

20
00:05:18,178 --> 00:05:19,053
Oh!

21
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:19,948
Is that a bay leaf?

22
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:30,126
Oh, well, I guess this means your birthday comes early.

23
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,168
Enough for a whole year.

24
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:40,876
But the bay tree's so far away.

25
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:43,126
If a human bean saw you...

26
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:44,834
I'm always careful.

27
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:48,793
The world is full of dangerous creatures.

28
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:52,084
Your great uncle...

29
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,511
...was eaten by a frog.

30
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:54,823
Right?

31
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:57,876
Doesn't that sh/so smell lovely?

32
00:05:58,334 --> 00:05:59,793
Yes, it does.

33
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:03,918
With a bit of sugar, I could make sh/so juice.

34
00:06:07,344 --> 00:06:08,657
Wait till tonight.

35
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:09,990
I'll borrow some for you.

36
00:06:11,844 --> 00:06:13,907
My first borrowing ever!

37
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:15,990
I've been practising night and day.

38
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,168
Papa's home.

39
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,501
Welcome back.

40
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:29,970
- Papa, about tonight...

41
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,782
- There's a boy in the house.

42
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:34,668
I saw him.

43
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:35,866
- No!

44
00:06:35,886 --> 00:06:36,949
Arrietty...

45
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,032
- He didn't see me!

46
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:40,637
I hid behind the bay leaf.

47
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:43,116
Papa, we're still going, aren't we?

48
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:44,533
I won't hear of it.

49
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:45,825
It's too dangerous.

50
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,168
But he's just a child!

51
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:52,293
Papa, I've been waiting for such a long time.

52
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:55,334
The children can be more savage than the grownups.

53
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:57,251
I'll be fine!

54
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,543
Youngsters go to bed early.

55
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,084
Thank you, Papa!

56
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:07,793
But Pod...

57
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,553
The boy's sick.

58
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:11,198
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

59
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:13,043
But Still...

60
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:15,428
Stop worrying, Mother.

61
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:17,073
We'll be extra careful.

62
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:22,834
Arrietty will be 14 soon.

63
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,959
Someday she'll have to survive without our help.

64
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:31,418
Sometimes I think we're the last Borrowers in the world.

65
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,376
Whatever you need, just ask Haru.

66
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:01,959
All right.

67
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:03,793
Haru, I'm depending on you.

68
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,709
Yes, ma'am.

69
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:14,346
Let's shut the screen.

70
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,034
Keep the bugs out.

71
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:04,501
Shouldn't you wear something darker?

72
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,584
I already decided!

73
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:12,626
I hope you can borrow some tissue paper.

74
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:15,084
And a bit of sugar, perhaps?

75
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:19,376
We could have sh/so juice and sugar for the tea.

76
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:23,918
But anything's just fine.

77
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,751
We'll be back soon.

78
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:30,762
- Please be careful.

79
00:09:30,782 --> 00:09:32,033
- We will.

80
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:05,043
Arrietty!

81
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,168
Sorry!

82
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:06,303
- Hold these for me.

83
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:07,823
- Okay.

84
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:43,751
Hold on tight!

85
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:31,001
Arrietty?

86
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,209
Ready?

87
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:59,751
Everything's so huge.

88
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:02,543
The world of human beans.

89
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:04,543
The sugar's over there.

90
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:11,168
Wait for me down there.

91
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:59,543
Papa, you're great.

92
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:25,334
Now, let's get that tissue.

93
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:47,376
Papa, look.

94
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:51,209
Your first borrowing.

95
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:53,793
Be careful, it's sharp.

96
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:55,043
I Will!

97
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:18,751
Papa, borrowing is such fun!

98
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,918
Look down there.

99
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:32,908
Rats.

100
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,033
Steer clear of them.

101
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,158
They're trouble.

102
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:36,959
I'm not afraid.

103
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:40,325
I'm ready for anything.

104
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:41,617
I've got this!

105
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:45,834
Sometimes it's best not to go looking for danger.

106
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:33,751
What is this place?

107
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:37,709
Human beans made it for their dolls.

108
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,418
It's just perfect for us!

109
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:52,793
I'm sure Mother would love that dresser over there.

110
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:54,709
These things aren't for borrowing.

111
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,918
If anything went missing, they'd know right away.

112
00:18:58,834 --> 00:18:59,918
Oh...

113
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:22,084
Don't be afraid.

114
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:43,616
I saw you.

115
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,616
In the garden.

116
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:47,616
It was you, wasn't it?

117
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:56,918
My mother told me about you.

118
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:01,751
She saw little people here when she was young.

119
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:06,251
Was it you that she saw?

120
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:10,043
Was it?

121
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,418
I'm sorry, Papa.

122
00:22:58,918 --> 00:23:01,251
He saw me today, out in the garden.

123
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:05,251
I should've been more careful.

124
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,293
I hope he didn't frighten you.

125
00:23:08,418 --> 00:23:13,334
Best not tell your mother, it will only worry her.

126
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,584
All right.

127
00:23:20,011 --> 00:23:22,783
You don't always have to run.

128
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:25,575
Observe them first, then decide.

129
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,918
We're home.

130
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:42,834
Safe and sound.

131
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:55,751
And...?

132
00:23:57,418 --> 00:23:59,209
Things didn't go well this time.

133
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:02,543
This light gave out before we finished.

134
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:04,709
Oh dear.

135
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:08,418
We had to give up on the sugar.

136
00:24:08,886 --> 00:24:10,637
Don't give it a thought.

137
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,408
At least you're safe and sound.

138
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:15,657
Arrietty, you found something.

139
00:24:15,677 --> 00:24:17,865
Show your mother your first borrowing.

140
00:24:27,043 --> 00:24:28,793
What a pretty pin.

141
00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:33,918
Time for bed.

142
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:42,584
Good night.

143
00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:50,084
She looks worn out.

144
00:24:51,043 --> 00:24:52,751
Shall I make some tea?

145
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:27,501
She!

146
00:27:27,636 --> 00:27:29,095
Come in the house.

147
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,574
You'll catch cold out there.

148
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:15,533
A cube of sugar?

149
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:16,825
But whatever for?

150
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:19,751
He left it by the grating.

151
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:23,251
It's probably the same one I dropped last night.

152
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:25,918
What?

153
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:28,751
What do you mean, you dropped it?

154
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:34,658
Don't touch it.

155
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:35,908
Do you understand?

156
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:40,918
It's a trap.

157
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:44,293
They're trying to catch us!

158
00:28:44,918 --> 00:28:48,334
We'll have to stop borrowing for a while.

159
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:50,959
Maybe they already know where we are.

160
00:28:51,084 --> 00:28:52,918
Pod, we'll have to move!

161
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:57,793
This was such a lovely house.

162
00:28:57,918 --> 00:29:00,084
Now we'll have to start all over again.

163
00:29:02,293 --> 00:29:05,043
Well, let's see how things go.

164
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:07,251
Now eat, soup's getting cold.

165
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:11,418
Why did it have to be sugar?

166
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:34,793
Thank you, Arrietty.

167
00:29:34,918 --> 00:29:37,918
I wanted to hang everything while the sun's out.

168
00:29:39,084 --> 00:29:41,584
You know I love doing laundry.

169
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:48,137
- I'm going to nap for a bit.

170
00:29:48,157 --> 00:29:50,241
- All right.

171
00:30:32,501 --> 00:34:48,584
"You forgot something" You came back.

172
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:53,418
Wait, don't go.

173
00:34:57,543 --> 00:34:59,584
Please leave us alone.

174
00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:02,418
I wanted to tell you that.

175
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:05,584
I want to talk to you.

176
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:08,209
Human beans are dangerous.

177
00:35:08,344 --> 00:35:10,366
If we're seen, we have to leave.

178
00:35:10,386 --> 00:35:12,408
My parents said so.

179
00:35:13,553 --> 00:35:15,053
You have a family?

180
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,573
I envy you.

181
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:19,876
Don't you have one?

182
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:24,001
Yes, but I practically never see my father.

183
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:27,918
Mother's so busy at work, she barely has time for me.

184
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,418
Really...

185
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:35,449
My name's Sho.

186
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:37,074
What's your name?

187
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:41,793
Do you have one?

188
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,459
Of course I have a name!

189
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:47,084
It's Arrietty.

190
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:51,084
Arrietty. . .Arrietty...

191
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:54,084
That's pretty.

192
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:11,720
Won't you let me see you?

193
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,782
Just for a moment.

194
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,741
Just a peek.

195
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:23,158
Please?

196
00:37:14,303 --> 00:37:15,825
What's happening?

197
00:37:15,845 --> 00:37:17,367
Oh my gosh, it's a crow!

198
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,334
You can't come in here!

199
00:37:40,136 --> 00:37:42,241
What got into that bird?

200
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,366
They never behave like that.

201
00:37:44,501 --> 00:37:47,543
Maybe it's nesting season or something.

202
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,157
Now I have to replace this screen.

203
00:37:54,177 --> 00:37:56,365
Where do we keep them?

204
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:58,751
Are you all right?

205
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:02,918
Maybe you should take some of your medicine.

206
00:38:03,418 --> 00:38:04,918
Thanks, Haru.

207
00:38:05,043 --> 00:38:06,584
I feel fine.

208
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:16,918
The nesting season, eh?

209
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:28,168
Have yourself a nice long rest now.

210
00:39:27,584 --> 00:39:28,918
Papa“.

211
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:33,074
- I told you to stay away.

212
00:39:33,094 --> 00:39:34,907
- I'm sorry.

213
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:38,084
I wanted to do something to help.

214
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,709
But he didn't see me.

215
00:39:42,168 --> 00:39:45,043
You put your family in danger.

216
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:47,679
I won't say it again.

217
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:49,284
Understand?

218
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:50,418
Yes.

219
00:40:00,126 --> 00:40:02,709
We'd better start looking.

220
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:07,626
It's time.

221
00:40:12,084 --> 00:40:13,126
Pod...

222
00:40:29,053 --> 00:40:39,074
"You forgot something" Afternoon!

223
00:40:39,094 --> 00:40:49,115
Package for you.

224
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:53,179
Thanks again, ma'am.

225
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:54,617
It's pretty hot out there.

226
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:58,459
Listen, know any good pest control companies?

227
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:00,418
Pest control?

228
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:06,501
Here's one. "Squeaky Klean Service."

229
00:41:06,636 --> 00:41:08,428
Squeaky Klean Service?

230
00:41:08,448 --> 00:41:10,240
Let me just write that down.

231
00:41:13,543 --> 00:41:15,418
Having problems with mice?

232
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:20,584
Maybe it's mice, or maybe it's something else.

233
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:25,293
Between us, it's little people.

234
00:41:25,418 --> 00:41:27,418
I've seen them myself.

235
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:37,126
A crow tried to fly into your room?

236
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:38,959
I hope it didn't scare you.

237
00:41:39,553 --> 00:41:41,137
Don't worry, Aunt Sadako.

238
00:41:41,157 --> 00:41:42,741
Haru chased it out.

239
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:46,751
I was so astonished!

240
00:41:46,876 --> 00:41:49,126
I never saw such a huge...

241
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:52,959
Excitement's the worst thing in the world for his heart.

242
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:56,043
He came here for peace and quiet.

243
00:41:57,293 --> 00:42:00,126
If anything were to happen before the operation...

244
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,418
I know, I know.

245
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:07,959
I realize his mother's terribly busy at work.

246
00:42:08,084 --> 00:42:11,126
But to go abroad on business and leave a sick child?

247
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:15,918
It must be terribly hard for you without your mother.

248
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:18,626
I don't mind.

249
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:21,918
I suppose the divorce couldn't be helped.

250
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:26,584
But why can't she be here, when he needs her so?

251
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:38,459
Aunt Sadako, who made that little house in my room?

252
00:42:38,584 --> 00:42:40,168
It's amazing.

253
00:42:40,293 --> 00:42:42,376
You mean the doll house?

254
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:45,709
That doll house belongs to your mother.

255
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:49,293
She left it here when she moved out.

256
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:50,418
It was hers?

257
00:42:51,084 --> 00:42:54,834
My father had it made to order in England.

258
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:57,459
It was for the little people.

259
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:02,001
My father claimed he'd seen them.

260
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:04,084
He waited for so many years.

261
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:09,251
He always said that house was a present for them.

262
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:13,418
But I'm afraid they never showed themselves again.

263
00:43:13,543 --> 00:43:17,584
Not in my father's lifetime, nor in mine.

264
00:43:18,084 --> 00:43:22,709
Young Master, did you happen to see any little people in your room?

265
00:43:26,626 --> 00:43:28,251
Unfortunately...no.

266
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:32,626
It's been in our family for four generations.

267
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:36,959
If you like it, it will be yours someday.

268
00:43:37,084 --> 00:43:38,584
You mean it?

269
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:40,126
Yes.

270
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:42,949
Have you looked inside?

271
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:45,032
It's quite beautiful!

272
00:43:49,386 --> 00:43:51,304
- Haru, could you turn off the lights?

273
00:43:51,324 --> 00:43:53,242
- Yes.

274
00:44:05,126 --> 00:44:07,126
This is the living room.

275
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:11,918
All the furnishings were hand-made by a real furniture maker.

276
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:15,668
Isn't it wonderful?

277
00:44:16,178 --> 00:44:18,679
Here's the library on the first floor.

278
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:21,200
There's even a bathroom.

279
00:44:21,751 --> 00:44:26,084
But the next room is my personal favourite.

280
00:44:26,209 --> 00:44:28,876
Haru, could you open that up?

281
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:31,918
Let's see, I think it opens this way.

282
00:44:36,626 --> 00:44:38,418
Everything is so detailed!

283
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:41,918
Detailed and just like the real thing.

284
00:44:42,386 --> 00:44:44,324
That's a real oven.

285
00:44:44,344 --> 00:44:46,282
You could use it for baking.

286
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:48,501
Beautiful, just beautiful.

287
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:51,626
What a pity Father's dream never came true.

288
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:53,209
And it's been so long...

289
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:56,584
Maybe the little people are gone now.

290
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:21,001
Mother, we've had these pictures three years.

291
00:47:21,126 --> 00:47:22,418
Don't you want new ones?

292
00:47:22,918 --> 00:47:25,459
I love those pictures.

293
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:29,584
I've always dreamed I'd see the real ocean someday.

294
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:33,709
Besides, there's no point changing them now.

295
00:47:38,251 --> 00:47:40,626
Papa's later than usual.

296
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:44,084
I hope he didn't get caught in that downpour.

297
00:47:48,594 --> 00:47:50,074
- Papa?

298
00:47:50,094 --> 00:47:51,574
- That's the back door.

299
00:47:55,303 --> 00:47:56,095
Papa!

300
00:47:56,115 --> 00:47:56,907
Welcome back...

301
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,793
Twisted my leg.

302
00:48:00,918 --> 00:48:03,251
It's lucky Spiller found me.

303
00:48:09,376 --> 00:48:10,626
Pod?

304
00:48:10,761 --> 00:48:12,991
Oh dear, you're hurt!

305
00:48:13,011 --> 00:48:15,241
Hurry, bring him in.

306
00:48:17,793 --> 00:48:19,084
Does it hurt?

307
00:48:19,219 --> 00:48:20,720
It's not broken.

308
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,241
I'll be fine in no time.

309
00:48:23,126 --> 00:48:25,584
I'll get some cold water.

310
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:30,084
Here's a towel, better dry off.

311
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:32,459
Who's this?

312
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:40,584
It's not just the three of us after all.

313
00:48:49,251 --> 00:48:50,543
Got to go.

314
00:48:50,668 --> 00:48:53,584
Wait, at least stay and have some tea.

315
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:04,220
I'll see to your father.

316
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,241
Get Spiller a cup of tea.

317
00:49:07,969 --> 00:49:09,679
Thank you, Spiller.

318
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:11,409
Papa's so lucky you came along.

319
00:49:15,209 --> 00:49:17,251
We're so grateful for your help.

320
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:20,626
Listen, have you seen other Borrowers?

321
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:24,751
You see, we thought we might be the only ones left.

322
00:49:28,334 --> 00:49:29,543
This many.

323
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:33,168
Then Cousin Lupy must be okay!

324
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:36,918
Can I see your bow?

325
00:49:42,918 --> 00:49:44,918
You use this for hunting.

326
00:49:49,844 --> 00:49:51,366
Give that back.

327
00:49:51,386 --> 00:49:52,908
It's not a toy.

328
00:50:08,584 --> 00:50:10,251
Got to go.

329
00:50:11,918 --> 00:50:15,043
Won't you stay and have a bite?

330
00:50:17,668 --> 00:50:19,251
Got this.

331
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:24,418
A cricket's leg!

332
00:50:26,053 --> 00:50:27,075
Want some?

333
00:50:27,095 --> 00:50:28,117
It's real good.

334
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:29,418
No thanks!

335
00:50:34,084 --> 00:50:35,126
Take care.

336
00:50:36,793 --> 00:50:38,251
Thanks again.

337
00:50:41,918 --> 00:50:43,584
I'll see him out.

338
00:50:49,918 --> 00:50:52,584
You were looking for a new place.

339
00:50:53,553 --> 00:50:54,950
I tripped and fell.

340
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,367
Couldn't move.

341
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:57,784
Then Spiller came.

342
00:50:57,918 --> 00:50:59,584
Really...

343
00:51:00,084 --> 00:51:03,251
His territory reaches past the river.

344
00:51:04,043 --> 00:51:07,959
And he knows a few places we could live.

345
00:51:09,084 --> 00:51:10,834
That's good, I suppose.

346
00:51:11,918 --> 00:51:14,251
I'd hate to camp out.

347
00:51:15,668 --> 00:51:19,584
But I doubt we'll find anything quite as nice as this.

348
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:27,084
I'm glad there are still others like us.

349
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,209
Do you have friends and family, Spiller?

350
00:51:30,803 --> 00:51:32,200
Family?

351
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,617
No, just me.

352
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:36,709
Well, I hope you can come again.

353
00:51:36,834 --> 00:51:39,918
My mother's stew is the best in the world.

354
00:52:45,251 --> 00:52:46,668
Haru?

355
00:53:05,168 --> 00:53:08,209
Arrietty, your stitches need to be closer together.

356
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:09,918
Pull it apart and do it again.

357
00:53:11,918 --> 00:53:15,584
Why do we need such a big sack anyway?

358
00:53:23,251 --> 00:53:26,084
I'm going to look in on Papa.

359
00:53:28,293 --> 00:53:30,251
Papa, can I come in?

360
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,209
How's your leg?

361
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:36,584
I'll be walking soon.

362
00:53:37,334 --> 00:53:38,918
Papa?

363
00:53:41,043 --> 00:53:43,209
Are we going to move?

364
00:53:44,386 --> 00:53:46,137
We were seen.

365
00:53:46,157 --> 00:53:47,908
We've no choice but to move.

366
00:53:51,918 --> 00:53:55,501
I don't think every human bean is dangerous.

367
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:58,376
Arrietty...

368
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:03,126
Before you were born, there were two other families living in this house.

369
00:54:03,261 --> 00:54:04,762
One family went missing.

370
00:54:04,782 --> 00:54:06,283
They just disappeared.

371
00:54:06,418 --> 00:54:08,584
The other one moved away.

372
00:54:09,084 --> 00:54:10,876
They were seen by humans.

373
00:54:11,834 --> 00:54:14,751
No matter what happens, we've got to survive.

374
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:16,918
Papa“.

375
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:34,928
What in heaven's name!

376
00:54:34,948 --> 00:54:36,823
Is this an earthquake?

377
00:55:01,418 --> 00:55:02,709
Mother!

378
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:06,709
It won't open.

379
00:55:10,834 --> 00:55:12,834
The frame's buckled.

380
00:55:33,418 --> 00:55:35,918
The...the wall!

381
00:56:12,084 --> 00:56:13,376
Homily!

382
00:56:15,293 --> 00:56:16,626
Homily!

383
00:56:18,418 --> 00:56:21,918
I always dreamed of having a kitchen like this.

384
00:57:27,001 --> 00:57:29,751
Gather only the things we need.

385
00:57:37,418 --> 00:57:40,001
We can't carry all that.

386
00:57:40,126 --> 00:57:43,751
And Homily, take nothing from the doll house.

387
00:57:45,918 --> 00:57:47,918
I'll make sure it's safe.

388
00:57:48,678 --> 00:57:49,928
- Stay with your mother.

389
00:57:49,948 --> 00:57:51,198
- Yes.

390
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,084
You finally came.

391
00:58:35,084 --> 00:58:37,876
Do you like your new kitchen?

392
00:58:39,626 --> 00:58:41,876
Our house is a disaster.

393
00:58:44,261 --> 00:58:45,741
But it doesn't matter.

394
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:47,241
I came to say goodbye.

395
00:58:52,334 --> 00:58:53,751
Can I look?

396
00:59:18,209 --> 00:59:19,543
You're beautiful.

397
00:59:22,918 --> 00:59:24,876
We have to move.

398
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:27,751
We were seen.

399
00:59:28,709 --> 00:59:31,626
Borrowers aren't meant to be seen.

400
00:59:31,761 --> 00:59:33,720
- Borrowers...?

401
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,699
- We borrow from human beans.

402
00:59:35,844 --> 00:59:37,012
Things we need.

403
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,200
Things they won't miss.

404
00:59:39,136 --> 00:59:40,845
Soap and cookies and sugar.

405
00:59:40,865 --> 00:59:42,574
Electricity and gas, too.

406
00:59:43,126 --> 00:59:46,334
Even my great-grandfather was a Borrower.

407
00:59:47,469 --> 00:59:49,699
- No one ever saw them?

408
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,949
- Probably.

409
00:59:54,876 --> 00:59:56,918
It's all my fault.

410
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:00,241
Niya, don't be like that.

411
01:00:00,261 --> 01:00:01,908
Be nice to her.

412
01:00:03,376 --> 01:00:07,418
Are there other little people like you in the house?

413
01:00:08,251 --> 01:00:11,418
No, it's just my father and mother and me.

414
01:00:12,084 --> 01:00:13,834
What about in other houses?

415
01:00:13,969 --> 01:00:15,845
I'm sure there are some.

416
01:00:15,865 --> 01:00:17,741
I've only met one so far.

417
01:00:18,418 --> 01:00:19,459
Oh.

418
01:00:20,959 --> 01:00:24,209
Soon you'll be the only one left.

419
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:28,376
Every year there's fewer of you, right?

420
01:00:28,918 --> 01:00:32,251
You're a doomed species, you know.

421
01:00:34,668 --> 01:00:36,209
That's not true!

422
01:00:36,344 --> 01:00:37,970
There's lots more of us.

423
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:39,616
Spiller said so!

424
01:00:40,209 --> 01:00:41,626
Spiller?

425
01:00:41,751 --> 01:00:43,418
He's one of us.

426
01:00:43,959 --> 01:00:46,918
And he said there's lots more.

427
01:00:48,418 --> 01:00:53,001
Do you know how many people there are in the world?

428
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:57,084
There are 6.7 billion of us.

429
01:00:58,126 --> 01:01:00,126
Six point seven billion...?

430
01:01:00,876 --> 01:01:02,209
What about you?

431
01:01:03,001 --> 01:01:04,584
I don't know.

432
01:01:05,251 --> 01:01:07,959
There's probably just a few of you.

433
01:01:08,084 --> 01:01:12,084
Until my mother told me, I didn't know little people existed.

434
01:01:14,251 --> 01:01:17,751
Lots of species are already extinct.

435
01:01:18,834 --> 01:01:21,418
I've only seen them in books, though.

436
01:01:22,418 --> 01:01:24,876
So many beautiful species...

437
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:28,709
But the environment changed, so they died out.

438
01:01:29,168 --> 01:01:33,751
It's sad, but that's what fate has in store for your kind.

439
01:01:35,418 --> 01:01:36,876
Fate, you say?

440
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:39,824
You're the one who changed things.

441
01:01:39,844 --> 01:01:42,074
Now we have to move away.

442
01:01:43,469 --> 01:01:44,824
We have to survive.

443
01:01:44,844 --> 01:01:46,199
That's what Papa said.

444
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:49,209
So we're leaving, even though it's dangerous.

445
01:01:50,011 --> 01:01:52,783
We'll make do, we always have.

446
01:01:52,803 --> 01:01:55,575
You don't know anything about us!

447
01:01:56,043 --> 01:01:59,293
We're not going to die out that easily!

448
01:02:01,594 --> 01:02:03,220
I'm sorry.

449
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,866
You're right.

450
01:02:05,793 --> 01:02:08,209
I'm the one who's going to die.

451
01:02:13,376 --> 01:02:15,209
It's my heart.

452
01:02:15,751 --> 01:02:19,584
They're going to operate next week, but it's probably hopeless.

453
01:02:19,709 --> 01:02:21,084
Your heart...?

454
01:02:23,219 --> 01:02:24,970
I've always been sick.

455
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:26,741
I can't play like other kids.

456
01:02:27,584 --> 01:02:32,043
From the moment I saw you, I wanted to protect you.

457
01:02:32,168 --> 01:02:34,418
I can't even do that.

458
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,459
I hope you can forgive me.

459
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:41,334
I didn't know you were so sick.

460
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:08,876
What in the world is this doing here?

461
01:03:36,084 --> 01:03:38,918
It's the kitchen from the doll house!

462
01:03:55,126 --> 01:03:57,084
Found you!

463
01:04:02,584 --> 01:04:03,876
What's wrong?

464
01:04:04,459 --> 01:04:07,668
My mother...l heard her voice.

465
01:04:38,793 --> 01:04:42,084
This really is a great kitchen.

466
01:04:42,626 --> 01:04:45,668
You're not the only little one here, I bet.

467
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:10,543
I have to go.

468
01:05:57,469 --> 01:05:58,949
Let me out!

469
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:00,449
Help me!

470
01:07:08,626 --> 01:07:10,418
The ceiling's tilted.

471
01:08:36,678 --> 01:08:38,262
Hello?

472
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:39,866
Squeaky Klean Service?

473
01:08:40,001 --> 01:08:42,626
Can you make an urgent house call?

474
01:08:42,761 --> 01:08:44,262
There's something small in the house.

475
01:08:44,282 --> 01:08:45,783
No, not mice.

476
01:08:45,928 --> 01:08:47,803
- No! mice?

477
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,698
- I don't want them killed.

478
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,584
You need trapping services ?

479
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:53,074
Yes, that's it.

480
01:08:53,094 --> 01:08:54,449
I want you to trap them.

481
01:09:05,459 --> 01:09:07,084
Sho!Sho!

482
01:09:10,709 --> 01:09:11,918
Arrietty!

483
01:09:17,793 --> 01:09:19,126
Mother's gone!

484
01:09:20,261 --> 01:09:22,241
Someone took the roof off.

485
01:09:22,261 --> 01:09:24,241
I think a human bean got her!

486
01:09:29,918 --> 01:09:31,668
Mother...

487
01:09:41,709 --> 01:09:43,293
We'll find her.

488
01:10:18,334 --> 01:10:20,209
Ifslocked.

489
01:10:23,584 --> 01:10:26,418
Let's try the room next door.

490
01:10:46,219 --> 01:10:47,387
- Can't budge it.

491
01:10:47,407 --> 01:10:48,575
- Wait!

492
01:10:58,918 --> 01:11:01,043
I can fit.

493
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:36,501
Amazing!

494
01:12:11,876 --> 01:12:14,251
No, that's not it.

495
01:12:15,136 --> 01:12:16,783
There's a dirt road.

496
01:12:16,803 --> 01:12:18,450
Turn in there.

497
01:12:18,594 --> 01:12:19,991
- Before the bridge?

498
01:12:20,011 --> 01:12:21,408
- No, not that one!

499
01:12:29,751 --> 01:12:32,126
Haru opened this.

500
01:12:32,584 --> 01:12:35,584
Then she must've taken Mother someplace.

501
01:13:12,084 --> 01:13:13,709
Are you okay?

502
01:13:23,418 --> 01:13:26,418
What's taking them so long?

503
01:14:00,011 --> 01:14:01,324
Mother!

504
01:14:01,344 --> 01:14:02,657
Where are you?

505
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:21,293
But the lock...

506
01:14:21,418 --> 01:14:22,876
Lock?

507
01:14:25,084 --> 01:14:27,626
Could I have some hot milk?

508
01:14:27,751 --> 01:14:30,459
Okay, wait just a minute.

509
01:14:39,751 --> 01:14:41,251
Thanks.

510
01:15:18,886 --> 01:15:20,720
I'm a little hungry.

511
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:22,574
Are there any cookies?

512
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:30,084
Mother!

513
01:15:31,668 --> 01:15:33,209
Mother!

514
01:15:40,761 --> 01:15:42,012
- Mother?

515
01:15:42,032 --> 01:15:43,283
- Arrietty!

516
01:15:50,376 --> 01:15:52,834
Here I am, Arrietty!

517
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,084
Mother!

518
01:15:58,209 --> 01:15:59,918
Arrietty!

519
01:16:26,761 --> 01:16:29,074
There they are.

520
01:16:29,094 --> 01:16:31,407
They finally found the right road.

521
01:16:52,501 --> 01:16:54,584
Another human bean!

522
01:16:58,376 --> 01:17:00,084
It's all right, Mother.

523
01:17:23,293 --> 01:17:26,543
We'd like to take a look around first.

524
01:17:26,668 --> 01:17:28,084
Take your time.

525
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:55,126
Now who can this be?

526
01:17:56,261 --> 01:17:57,324
Haru?

527
01:17:57,344 --> 01:17:58,407
Haru!

528
01:18:00,626 --> 01:18:02,543
What's going on here?

529
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,553
It's finally happened.

530
01:18:04,573 --> 01:18:06,448
The little people are here!

531
01:18:06,584 --> 01:18:08,043
Little people?

532
01:18:09,303 --> 01:18:11,178
That's right.

533
01:18:11,198 --> 01:18:13,073
And what little thieves they are!

534
01:18:26,084 --> 01:18:28,251
It's really true.

535
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:35,543
They steal from all over the house.

536
01:18:35,668 --> 01:18:38,876
That's why things were going missing.

537
01:18:39,918 --> 01:18:42,209
Haru, what's got into you?

538
01:18:42,334 --> 01:18:45,168
All these years I thought it was my imagination.

539
01:18:45,293 --> 01:18:47,251
Well, it wasn't.

540
01:18:48,001 --> 01:18:51,543
You certainly didn't need to call the exterminators.

541
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,387
We'd better hurry.

542
01:18:54,407 --> 01:18:56,033
The house is full of them!

543
01:18:57,751 --> 01:19:00,043
You'll believe me when you see this.

544
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:02,959
This is their nest.

545
01:19:04,751 --> 01:19:06,418
Nest?

546
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:15,084
It looks like a pile of old junk to me.

547
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:19,804
What?

548
01:19:19,824 --> 01:19:21,242
I swear I saw it.

549
01:19:22,584 --> 01:19:25,626
Haru, I'm sending the exterminators away.

550
01:19:25,751 --> 01:19:28,209
Now, wait just a minute.

551
01:19:29,543 --> 01:19:31,668
The doll house!

552
01:19:39,219 --> 01:19:40,429
Young Master?

553
01:19:40,449 --> 01:19:41,659
May we come in for a minute?

554
01:19:41,918 --> 01:19:42,918
All right.

555
01:19:54,428 --> 01:19:56,366
You won't believe this.

556
01:19:56,386 --> 01:19:58,324
They stole the little kitchen too.

557
01:19:59,876 --> 01:20:02,709
You'll see, it's gone.

558
01:20:06,293 --> 01:20:07,668
It's not gone.

559
01:20:07,793 --> 01:20:10,084
Such a pleasure to look at.

560
01:20:23,261 --> 01:20:25,158
Wait, I can prove it!

561
01:20:25,178 --> 01:20:27,075
I have one of them in a jar.

562
01:20:30,043 --> 01:20:33,084
I wonder what's got into Haru.

563
01:20:33,584 --> 01:20:34,584
Hmm?

564
01:20:36,959 --> 01:20:39,084
Fresh herbs, how lovely.

565
01:20:54,084 --> 01:20:56,209
Someone was making tea!

566
01:20:58,219 --> 01:21:00,387
It's just as my father said.

567
01:21:00,407 --> 01:21:02,575
There are little people living here.

568
01:21:05,793 --> 01:21:07,084
Yes, there are.

569
01:21:08,084 --> 01:21:10,543
So Haru really saw them.

570
01:21:10,668 --> 01:21:13,293
Though she accused them of stealing.

571
01:21:13,428 --> 01:21:15,158
They're not thieves at all!

572
01:21:15,178 --> 01:21:16,908
They're Borrowers.

573
01:21:18,751 --> 01:21:21,584
I mean, I wish I could see them.

574
01:21:23,584 --> 01:21:26,084
I bet they're here somewhere.

575
01:21:30,918 --> 01:21:33,084
I'm sure they are.

576
01:21:46,584 --> 01:21:48,959
Excuse me, ma'am!

577
01:21:49,501 --> 01:21:51,751
Where'd you like us to start?

578
01:22:00,293 --> 01:22:02,084
Are you all right?

579
01:22:04,751 --> 01:22:06,876
It got away.

580
01:22:07,001 --> 01:22:09,668
I had one and it got away!

581
01:22:09,803 --> 01:22:11,595
It's not just my imagination.

582
01:22:11,615 --> 01:22:13,407
There are little people here!

583
01:22:14,501 --> 01:22:16,543
Next time I swear I'll get them!

584
01:22:32,001 --> 01:22:35,918
How far is it to where we're meeting Spiller?

585
01:22:37,094 --> 01:22:38,824
It's just outside the forest.

586
01:22:38,844 --> 01:22:40,574
Then we head down river.

587
01:22:41,928 --> 01:22:44,241
I'm already worn out.

588
01:22:44,261 --> 01:22:46,574
I'll never make it that far.

589
01:23:02,126 --> 01:23:03,626
Let's hurry.

590
01:23:04,709 --> 01:23:06,418
I can't do it...

591
01:23:32,928 --> 01:23:35,241
Better have something to eat.

592
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:37,574
We'll be walking till morning.

593
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:42,376
I'm so sorry.

594
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:47,751
It's my fault we had to leave such a wonderful house.

595
01:23:52,001 --> 01:23:53,793
That's in the past.

596
01:23:54,918 --> 01:23:58,751
We'll make another wonderful house, the three of us together.

597
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:06,751
I'm going outside for a bit.

598
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:10,251
Don't go too far, now.

599
01:24:45,584 --> 01:24:47,126
Niya!

600
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,501
Niya...

601
01:26:17,084 --> 01:26:18,751
Just a little further.

602
01:26:41,584 --> 01:26:43,084
Spiller!

603
01:26:57,793 --> 01:26:59,584
That's everything.

604
01:27:00,876 --> 01:27:03,043
Now let's get moving.

605
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,418
Okay.

606
01:27:08,834 --> 01:27:11,084
Mother, are you all right?

607
01:27:23,084 --> 01:27:24,584
Arrietty!

608
01:27:54,834 --> 01:27:56,293
She!

609
01:28:00,084 --> 01:28:01,584
Arrietty...

610
01:28:20,918 --> 01:28:22,959
We're leaving now.

611
01:28:27,751 --> 01:28:29,793
I'm glad I made it.

612
01:28:33,584 --> 01:28:35,751
Niya showed me the way.

613
01:28:43,386 --> 01:28:44,804
Thanks.

614
01:28:44,824 --> 01:28:46,242
Take care of yourself.

615
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:54,043
I brought this.

616
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:03,251
I hope you'll accept it this time.

617
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:10,543
Thank you.

618
01:29:24,251 --> 01:29:26,418
I have to go.

619
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:30,043
When is your operation?

620
01:29:30,168 --> 01:29:32,126
The day after tomorrow.

621
01:29:32,261 --> 01:29:34,408
I'm going to be okay.

622
01:29:34,428 --> 01:29:36,575
You gave me the courage to live.

623
01:29:45,126 --> 01:29:46,918
For luck.

624
01:29:51,793 --> 01:29:53,334
Thanks.

625
01:30:00,043 --> 01:30:02,584
You protected me after all.

626
01:30:04,751 --> 01:30:06,418
Arrietty...

627
01:30:08,793 --> 01:30:11,751
I hope you have the best life ever.

628
01:30:14,293 --> 01:30:15,584
Goodbye.

629
01:30:19,501 --> 01:30:24,584
Arrietty, you're a part of me now.

630
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:27,918
I'll never forget you, ever.

631
01:33:56,376 --> 01:34:08,418
A Studio Ghibli Film THE END
