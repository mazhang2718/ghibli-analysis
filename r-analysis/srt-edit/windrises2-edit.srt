1
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:23,479
THE WIND RISES The wind is rising!

2
00:00:23,499 --> 00:00:30,827
We must try to live.

3
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,732
Here it is.

4
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,948
May I borrow it?

5
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:09,473
- It's in English.

6
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:10,774
- I have a dictionary.

7
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:11,709
- Very good.

8
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:12,576
Give it a go.

9
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:13,443
- Thank you.

10
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,955
- Knock it off.

11
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:34,131
- Butt out!

12
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,809
Better get going.

13
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,644
Jiro...

14
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,272
No more bullying, okay?

15
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,458
You look quite the hero.

16
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,836
I slipped and fell.

17
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:04,862
- Fighting is never justified.

18
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,330
- I know.

19
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,593
Go have your snack.

20
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,344
Thank you.

21
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,515
Big brother, you're back!

22
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:18,980
I was waiting for you.

23
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,969
Let's pick bamboo grass.

24
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,982
Big brother!

25
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,529
I want to pick bamboo grass.

26
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,703
You promised to go with me.

27
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,079
I've got homework.

28
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,296
That's not homework.

29
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,839
It's an English magazine.

30
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,844
What a stupid moustache.

31
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,889
He's a famous Italian aircraft designer.

32
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:58,394
His name is Caproni.

33
00:06:58,414 --> 00:07:00,716
It says he's a count.

34
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:02,398
- Your face is scratched.

35
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:04,011
- Leave it alone.

36
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,858
I better put some iodine on it.

37
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,902
Would you be quiet?

38
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,082
Big brother, what are you doing?

39
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,917
You're not allowed up here.

40
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,585
You're not wearing glasses.

41
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:30,090
Focusing on the stars should improve my eyesight.

42
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:33,200
- Mother will scold you.

43
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,751
- A shooting star!

44
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,847
There's another one.

45
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,135
They're pretty.

46
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:41,280
See?

47
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,425
Like that.

48
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,939
There's so many of them.

49
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,145
I'm a Japanese boy.

50
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,445
I think this is my dream.

51
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,505
This is my dream, you know.

52
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,424
It's mine too.

53
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,009
Your dream?

54
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:58,368
Listen, Japanese boy.

55
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:00,669
You think we are sharing this dream?

56
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,015
It's strange.

57
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:04,291
You're Count Caproni, aren't you?

58
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,509
I'm very glad to meet you.

59
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:09,224
Interesting.

60
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:10,703
Yes, this is a dream.

61
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:12,182
This world is a dream.

62
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,194
Welcome to my kingdom.

63
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,862
I'm honored.

64
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,865
Look at them.

65
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,062
They will bomb the enemy city.

66
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:28,113
Most of them won't return.

67
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,384
But the war will soon be over.

68
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,228
Climb up, Japanese boy.

69
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:52,506
This is my dream.

70
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,933
When the war is over, I will build this.

71
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,863
Magnificent, isn't she?

72
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,907
Let's fly.

73
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,664
Instead of bombs, she'll carry passengers.

74
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,592
Of course we can't climb up here...

75
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:21,222
but dreams are convenient.

76
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:22,752
One can go anywhere.

77
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:32,108
Come, join me.

78
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:33,972
You can walk along the spar.

79
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,280
Take a look.

80
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:17,341
- She's beautiful, no?

81
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:19,309
- Yes, incredible.

82
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,577
She'll carry a hundred people across the Atlantic.

83
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,254
Mr.

84
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,038
Caproni?

85
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:31,822
I have a question.

86
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,336
Do you think I could design airplanes?

87
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,239
I'll never be a pilot.

88
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:41,832
I'm too nearsighted.

89
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,512
Listen, Japanese boy.

90
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:47,308
I'm not a pilot.

91
00:11:47,328 --> 00:11:49,005
I don't even know how to fly.

92
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,019
To fly airplanes is simple.

93
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:55,546
But I am a creator of airplanes.

94
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:57,765
An aeronautical engineer!

95
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,317
Yes!

96
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,694
Listen to me, Japanese boy.

97
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:03,991
Airplanes are not tools for war.

98
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:06,188
They are not for making money.

99
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,868
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.

100
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,163
Engineers turn dreams into reality.

101
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,665
Yes!

102
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,316
Arrivederci.

103
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:16,784
We'll meet again.

104
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:34,060
Jiro, you should go to bed.

105
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:37,504
You startled me.

106
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,889
I heard you talking to someone.

107
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,403
Mother, I'm going to be an aeronautical engineer.

108
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:44,929
Really?

109
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:46,397
That's a wonderful dream.

110
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:48,452
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.

111
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:50,149
That's what he told me.

112
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,704
I want to design beautiful airplanes.

113
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:22,882
You, there.

114
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,057
Come, take my seat.

115
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,278
Pardon me.

116
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,529
Please.

117
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,817
The wind feels wonderful.

118
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,737
Miss, you'll lose your hat.

119
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,988
Don't worry, Kinu.

120
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,998
Watch out!

121
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,336
Are you all right?

122
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,129
Safe!

123
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,964
Nice play.

124
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,050
Thank you.

125
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,344
"Le vent se lève."

126
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,181
"Il faut tenter de vivre."

127
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:01,398
"Le vent se lève.

128
00:15:01,418 --> 00:15:03,325
Il faut tenter de vivre."

129
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:05,861
"The wind is rising.

130
00:15:05,881 --> 00:15:07,704
We must try to live."

131
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,226
Earthquake.

132
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,489
The boiler's going to blow!

133
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,461
- What's wrong?

134
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:08,449
- Her leg.

135
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,794
Show me.

136
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,130
It hurts.

137
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,590
Kinu, be brave.

138
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:16,011
It's broken.

139
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,374
She can't walk like this.

140
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:19,098
Miss, the boiler.

141
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:20,628
Please save yourself.

142
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,306
That's nonsense.

143
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,977
Nothing's going to explode.

144
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,480
My suitcase.

145
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,197
Now, try to relax.

146
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:44,707
She can't walk.

147
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:45,987
Where do you live?

148
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:47,334
- In Ueno.

149
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:48,655
- I'll get you there.

150
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:02,308
- Fire.

151
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:03,338
- Let's go.

152
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,055
- What about your luggage?

153
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:21,440
- It's not important.

154
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,390
I'm so sorry.

155
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,892
Hang on!

156
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,445
We'd better hurry.

157
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:45,098
One of my shirts.

158
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,607
It's brand new.

159
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,285
You must be thirsty.

160
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:53,919
The well's almost dry.

161
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:55,240
What about you?

162
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,502
Thank you.

163
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,635
The fire hasn't reached Ueno.

164
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:05,994
I'm heading for the university.

165
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:07,337
What about you?

166
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,515
I'll bring someone from home.

167
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,851
I'll go with you.

168
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:13,438
- Look after this, Kinu.

169
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,801
- I will.

170
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:16,067
We'll be back soon.

171
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:17,222
Don't worry.

172
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,608
Watch my suitcase.

173
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:42,299
- Thank you.

174
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,767
- I'll leave her to you.

175
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,778
But what's your name?

176
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:51,767
That was some guy.

177
00:21:51,787 --> 00:21:53,110
Don't you think, Kinu?

178
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:12,495
Jiro!

179
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:13,754
You picked a great day to come back.

180
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,474
How bad is it, Honjo?

181
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,144
The whole east side is burning.

182
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,565
That's everything we could carry.

183
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,108
Got a smoke?

184
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:30,900
A flying door?

185
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,254
That's just great.

186
00:22:32,274 --> 00:22:33,608
They'll never stop the fire now.

187
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,452
Tokyo's finished.

188
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:51,868
He really built it.

189
00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:53,961
Caproni has giant dreams.

190
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,575
Stop the camera!

191
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,129
The wind's shifting.

192
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:07,367
It's coming this way.

193
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,343
Is the wind still rising, Japanese boy?

194
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,388
Yes, it's a gale.

195
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:21,517
Then you must live. "Le vent se lève."

196
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,061
"II faut tenter de vivre."

197
00:25:23,573 --> 00:25:24,500
Hey Jiro.

198
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,447
Ready?

199
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,211
All the new buildings are old-fashioned.

200
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,464
The streets are wider.

201
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,841
Even the airplanes haven't changed.

202
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,470
Welcome!

203
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,018
Mackerel again?

204
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,644
It's great.

205
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:49,149
Every day's the same.

206
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:50,637
Same lunch, same lectures.

207
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,816
Can I get an egg?

208
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,153
The Western powers are building all-metal aircraft.

209
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,781
Try the pork sometime.

210
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,784
We're more than ten years behind.

211
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,161
What?

212
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,704
Beautiful, isn't it?

213
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,665
Look at that wonderful curve.

214
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,710
You eat mackerel to look at the bones?

215
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:13,757
Come on, finish up.

216
00:26:13,777 --> 00:26:15,329
We're going for coffee.

217
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,520
Jiro sure is working hard.

218
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,355
Fish bones.

219
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,922
Is Mr.

220
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:34,056
Horikoshi back from lunch?

221
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,234
Jiro!

222
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,653
Honjo, listen to this.

223
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:42,032
The NACA has a standard curve just like this bone.

224
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,867
Do Americans eat mackerel too?

225
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,161
Jiro, package for you.

226
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:50,999
A lady brought this for you, sir.

227
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,419
You were out, so she left it with me.

228
00:26:53,496 --> 00:26:54,756
I see.

229
00:26:54,776 --> 00:26:56,036
Thank you.

230
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,217
Present from your sweetheart?

231
00:27:00,337 --> 00:27:01,763
Got a smoke?

232
00:27:01,783 --> 00:27:03,209
Gimme one.

233
00:27:19,731 --> 00:27:20,678
- Jiro!

234
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:21,645
- Let him go.

235
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:46,896
- Hello, Mr.

236
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:47,680
Horikoshi.

237
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,464
- Back from school.

238
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:50,687
Your guest is waiting.

239
00:27:50,707 --> 00:27:52,759
A young lady.

240
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,605
Oh, right.

241
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,657
Honestly, where were you?

242
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,160
Kayo, I'm sorry.

243
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,412
I completely forgot.

244
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,788
Really!

245
00:28:12,117 --> 00:28:13,293
- Where's Mother?

246
00:28:13,313 --> 00:28:14,489
- At Uncle's.

247
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:15,879
- Is she staying there?

248
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:17,159
- Just for one night.

249
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:19,945
You've grown, Kayo.

250
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,913
And gotten very pretty, too.

251
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:24,200
You're so mean.

252
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,419
You never ever come home.

253
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,768
Oh, it's almost sunset already.

254
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:35,065
I'll tell them I kept you.

255
00:28:35,085 --> 00:28:37,304
Let's take the penny steamer.

256
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,027
She must really like you.

257
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,821
Come on, it's been two years.

258
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,658
Didn't you try to see her again?

259
00:28:47,694 --> 00:28:49,017
Of course.

260
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:50,360
I went back once.

261
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,175
The fire stopped at her street.

262
00:29:05,378 --> 00:29:06,054
See?

263
00:29:06,074 --> 00:29:06,750
There's the dock.

264
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,191
Are you cold?

265
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:23,301
I'm fine.

266
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:25,395
I never dreamed Tokyo would recover so quickly.

267
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,369
Can I stay with you, Jiro?

268
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,747
Father won't let me live here by myself.

269
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,751
I'll probably be in Nagoya by the time you come.

270
00:29:39,871 --> 00:29:40,881
- With an airplane company?

271
00:29:40,901 --> 00:29:41,911
- Yes.

272
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,922
Men have it so good.

273
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,676
I want to study medicine in Tokyo.

274
00:29:48,046 --> 00:29:49,597
A doctor?

275
00:29:49,617 --> 00:29:51,168
I think you might be a good one.

276
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,181
I think so too.

277
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:56,059
I'll talk to Father next time I'm home.

278
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:57,355
Thanks.

279
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:58,551
I'm counting on you.

280
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,962
Jiro!

281
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,633
There you are.

282
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:10,407
- You made it.

283
00:31:10,427 --> 00:31:11,165
- Finally.

284
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:12,556
- We're on our way.

285
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:13,836
- Yes, we are.

286
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,492
They must've been heading for the city.

287
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,160
There were hundreds of them.

288
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,287
There's no work in the countryside.

289
00:31:43,703 --> 00:31:45,359
Another bank failure.

290
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:47,035
Which one is it this time?

291
00:31:52,295 --> 00:31:53,471
- Are those the customers?

292
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:54,667
- Looks like it.

293
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,180
There were rumors.

294
00:31:57,842 --> 00:31:59,998
The economy's in the tank.

295
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,174
So is our new employer.

296
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:18,994
MITSUBISHI INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE CO.

297
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,813
We've been waiting for you.

298
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:24,656
What took you so long?

299
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,502
I was told to come anytime in April.

300
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,380
Then you should've come in March!

301
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,341
I've got an assignment for you.

302
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,387
It's the design for the wing strut fitting.

303
00:32:37,507 --> 00:32:39,184
I need it right away.

304
00:32:39,204 --> 00:32:40,881
We're behind schedule already.

305
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,063
In here.

306
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:50,153
The data's ready.

307
00:32:50,173 --> 00:32:51,725
This way.

308
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,411
This is your desk.

309
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,915
It's imported, but no one likes it.

310
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,292
Data here, hat goes there.

311
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:09,151
Listen up!

312
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:10,869
The Falcon Project has a new engineer.

313
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,883
He's the genius we've all been hearing about.

314
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,218
Introduce yourself.

315
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,261
Jiro Horikoshi.

316
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,430
Now get to work.

317
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,487
Jiro, come on.

318
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:01,450
It's lunchtime.

319
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,354
Let's go.

320
00:35:04,362 --> 00:35:06,227
- The assembly plant?

321
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:08,112
- Yes, I'd like to take a look.

322
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:13,877
Asking a green engineer to design that fitting is practically hazing.

323
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,253
Two.

324
00:35:15,832 --> 00:35:17,425
Excuse me.

325
00:35:17,445 --> 00:35:19,038
Could we ask a favor?

326
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,718
Look, it's really coming along.

327
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,930
Sorry to bother you on your break.

328
00:35:25,091 --> 00:35:27,060
Not at all.

329
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,049
You young engineers should visit us more often.

330
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,687
Honjo, the strut's already installed.

331
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,189
I knew it.

332
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:36,235
Kurokawa's just hazing you.

333
00:35:36,255 --> 00:35:38,223
Is his fitting better than yours?

334
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:39,594
Mr.

335
00:35:39,614 --> 00:35:40,937
Kurokawa's always hard on new employees.

336
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,282
Honjo, get up here and take a look.

337
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,409
I need your opinion.

338
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:53,398
- What do you think?

339
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:54,698
- Looks strong enough.

340
00:35:54,787 --> 00:35:56,422
This is no good.

341
00:35:56,442 --> 00:35:58,077
It's just like my design.

342
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,965
Then it must be bad.

343
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,300
Foreman, lunch break's over.

344
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,927
Quiet.

345
00:36:04,213 --> 00:36:05,723
Fascinating!

346
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:07,253
Aircraft are fascinating!

347
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,474
Maybe they are, but we're late.

348
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,985
I'm Hattori.

349
00:36:23,858 --> 00:36:24,993
Mr.

350
00:36:25,013 --> 00:36:26,148
Hattori is our chief engineer.

351
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,993
Is this his first assignment?

352
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,495
The strut fitting for the Falcon.

353
00:36:30,573 --> 00:36:32,104
That's no fitting.

354
00:36:32,124 --> 00:36:33,655
Explain yourself, young man.

355
00:36:33,743 --> 00:36:35,816
Yes sir.

356
00:36:35,836 --> 00:36:37,909
This leaf spring will absorb stress from the wing.

357
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,006
The wire expands and contracts automatically.

358
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:45,343
It runs through the strut to an anchor on the fuselage.

359
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,180
But we'd have to redesign the wing!

360
00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:50,684
You're right.

361
00:36:50,704 --> 00:36:52,172
I haven't done the calculations yet.

362
00:36:52,261 --> 00:36:54,292
You're wasting your time.

363
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,343
Where's the assignment I gave you?

364
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,689
It's finished.

365
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,197
That looks like a very clean design to me.

366
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,783
It's perfect.

367
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,162
Submit your work as soon as you finish!

368
00:37:14,951 --> 00:37:16,565
- I'm heading out.

369
00:37:16,585 --> 00:37:18,199
- Me too.

370
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:21,046
What about Kurokawa's homework?

371
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,380
Just finishing up.

372
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,553
Oxen!

373
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,972
They haul prototypes to the airfield.

374
00:37:31,425 --> 00:37:33,477
The latest aircraft, hauled by oxen.

375
00:37:33,497 --> 00:37:35,549
That's how backward we are.

376
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,395
But they're wonderful creatures.

377
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,003
Here she comes.

378
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,131
Get ready!

379
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,802
Approaching the mark.

380
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,311
Damn it!

381
00:39:09,982 --> 00:39:11,805
- Did you get it?

382
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:13,648
- 13.3 seconds. 145 knots.

383
00:39:13,736 --> 00:39:15,016
Too slow.

384
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:16,316
We need ten more knots.

385
00:39:16,405 --> 00:39:18,020
She's too low.

386
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,655
The engine's not performing.

387
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,667
Kurokawa!

388
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,503
Representatives from the Army.

389
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,213
An audacious design.

390
00:39:27,249 --> 00:39:29,197
- Another coup for Mitsubishi.

391
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:31,165
- Your Falcon is quite impressive.

392
00:39:48,938 --> 00:39:50,469
Power dive.

393
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:52,020
She's trying to break 200.

394
00:40:15,965 --> 00:40:16,995
- Parachute's open.

395
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:18,045
- Go get him!

396
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:35,847
Mr.

397
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:38,232
Kurokawa, we'll investigate the cause when the weather clears.

398
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:39,434
- What about the pilot?

399
00:40:39,454 --> 00:40:40,401
- He's okay.

400
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,746
That's good.

401
00:40:42,658 --> 00:40:43,867
Mr.

402
00:40:43,887 --> 00:40:45,096
Kurokawa, let's go.

403
00:40:45,116 --> 00:40:46,325
We'll build Falcon Two.

404
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,463
Do you think the strut fitting failed?

405
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:53,198
No.

406
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:55,750
I think the problem is deeper and more complicated.

407
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,763
I'll never forget what I saw today.

408
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:02,267
It's like an endless road is opening up before my eyes.

409
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,770
There won't be a Falcon Two.

410
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,482
The Army has decided to go with a competing design.

411
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,487
Today was our last chance to change their minds.

412
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:19,117
We're going to build a bomber with help from Junkers.

413
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:21,452
No more fighters for now.

414
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:25,564
This is your chance to see Germany.

415
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:27,449
I've already approved it.

416
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,269
- Still open?

417
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:05,528
- Ah, welcome back.

418
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,999
You're later than usual.

419
00:42:08,244 --> 00:42:09,608
- Two slices of the usual.

420
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:10,992
- Coming up.

421
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,844
There you are.

422
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,013
Isn't anyone looking after them?

423
00:42:22,258 --> 00:42:24,623
Their parents work late.

424
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:27,008
They wait there every night.

425
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,854
I feel bad closing the place up.

426
00:42:29,932 --> 00:42:30,795
I see.

427
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:31,678
Well, thanks.

428
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,191
Come again.

429
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:41,890
You must be hungry.

430
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,691
Here's something to eat.

431
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,477
It's sponge cake.

432
00:42:45,497 --> 00:42:46,694
I just bought it.

433
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,718
Go ahead, take it.

434
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,553
Come on!

435
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,071
You here, Jiro?

436
00:43:22,484 --> 00:43:24,266
Too bad about the Falcon.

437
00:43:24,286 --> 00:43:26,068
I heard they axed it.

438
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:29,416
Sponge cake?

439
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:31,071
You have some strange eating habits.

440
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,428
What did you expect?

441
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:47,849
Did you think she was going to smile and say thank you?

442
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,434
Of course not.

443
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,104
Well, maybe I did.

444
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,776
There are dozens of hungry kids right here in this neighborhood.

445
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:04,991
The cost of one fitting would feed that kid's family for a month.

446
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,119
Why is Japan so poor?

447
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:13,791
Jiro, do you know what we're paying the Germans for their technology?

448
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:18,838
Enough to feed every kid in Japan, with sponge cake for dessert.

449
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:22,967
Still, I plan to make the most of this opportunity.

450
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,802
They're sending you too?

451
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,137
They told me today.

452
00:44:26,215 --> 00:44:27,162
Really?

453
00:44:27,182 --> 00:44:28,129
That's great news.

454
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,267
Poor countries want airplanes.

455
00:44:31,387 --> 00:44:33,085
So they pay us a lot to design them.

456
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:34,803
It's ironic.

457
00:44:36,058 --> 00:44:37,673
I'm leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.

458
00:44:37,693 --> 00:44:39,308
Getting married.

459
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,776
Married?

460
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:45,323
To work hard at the office, you need a family at home.

461
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,158
More irony.

462
00:45:22,438 --> 00:45:25,053
Tight-fisted Germans.

463
00:45:25,073 --> 00:45:27,688
They're hardly showing us anything.

464
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,700
I don't see any oxen.

465
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,036
The airstrip's next to the plant.

466
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,038
Everything's so big.

467
00:45:56,472 --> 00:45:57,961
It's the G-38.

468
00:45:57,981 --> 00:45:59,470
Is this what we're buying?

469
00:45:59,516 --> 00:46:01,193
For conversion to a bomber.

470
00:46:01,213 --> 00:46:02,890
It's top secret.

471
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,237
Who's the Army planning to bomb with this thing?

472
00:46:06,315 --> 00:46:07,595
America, probably.

473
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,895
Not that they could.

474
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,578
Still, it's quite something.

475
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:14,954
Amazing.

476
00:46:15,782 --> 00:46:17,605
Passengers can sit in the wings.

477
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:19,448
This would be wasted as a bomber.

478
00:46:19,995 --> 00:46:22,277
Who cares?

479
00:46:22,297 --> 00:46:24,579
We need their all-metal airframe technology.

480
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:29,951
You're kidding.

481
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:31,252
We can't go inside?

482
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,292
Beautiful.

483
00:47:07,709 --> 00:47:09,011
Stop it.

484
00:47:09,031 --> 00:47:10,333
Take your hands off him.

485
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,970
Is this how Germans treat their guests?

486
00:47:13,048 --> 00:47:15,163
You Japanese copy everything.

487
00:47:15,183 --> 00:47:17,298
This technology belongs to Germany.

488
00:47:17,386 --> 00:47:19,251
Oh, come on.

489
00:47:19,271 --> 00:47:21,136
Japan has lots of planes like this.

490
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,772
Honjo, let it go.

491
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:27,151
We have a license to your technology.

492
00:47:27,729 --> 00:47:30,115
We signed an agreement.

493
00:47:30,135 --> 00:47:32,521
We have the right to be here.

494
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:37,495
Your bosses never said we couldn't inspect this airplane.

495
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,332
I'm sure you're only trying to do your job...

496
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,025
but we won't tolerate this treatment.

497
00:47:44,045 --> 00:47:46,660
The agreement is between equals.

498
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:51,008
Our orders were not to let you Japanese wander around.

499
00:48:09,396 --> 00:48:10,197
That's Dr.

500
00:48:10,217 --> 00:48:11,018
Junkers.

501
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:13,030
What an engineer.

502
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:16,514
You can go inside.

503
00:48:16,534 --> 00:48:17,437
Dr.

504
00:48:17,457 --> 00:48:18,360
Junkers has agreed.

505
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,551
I'm surprised we got a demonstration.

506
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,720
There's more vibration than I expected.

507
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,973
Our bosses are getting giddy.

508
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,393
Let the Army officers sit here.

509
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,399
Just a moment.

510
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,402
This is truly a stupendous aircraft.

511
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,740
Look, a corridor through the wing.

512
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,243
This is amazing.

513
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,247
It's like being inside a power plant.

514
00:49:07,663 --> 00:49:08,899
Guten tag.

515
00:49:08,919 --> 00:49:10,155
Dr.

516
00:49:10,175 --> 00:49:11,411
Junkers gave us permission.

517
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,716
Please show us your work station.

518
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,718
This is the flight engineer's station.

519
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,762
This aircraft is marvelous.

520
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,600
Japanese, do not go further.

521
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,437
Of course, my friend.

522
00:49:26,807 --> 00:49:28,192
- This is incredible.

523
00:49:28,212 --> 00:49:29,597
- Yes, it's fantastic.

524
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,943
A triumph of German industrial technology.

525
00:50:04,386 --> 00:50:06,417
Dr.

526
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:08,468
Junkers is my hero, but his company is sneaky.

527
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,316
Got a cigarette, Jiro?

528
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,819
Jiro!

529
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,155
A cigarette.

530
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:19,409
No.

531
00:50:19,429 --> 00:50:20,480
We're out.

532
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:40,511
It looks cold outside, but this room is cozy.

533
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,181
I thought Germans used fireplaces.

534
00:50:44,926 --> 00:50:47,125
Junkers makes radiators too.

535
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:49,344
This almost looks like that plane.

536
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,521
It's beautiful.

537
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:52,714
And our technology is primitive.

538
00:50:52,734 --> 00:50:54,849
That's what you mean, right?

539
00:50:55,427 --> 00:51:00,364
You think we'll never figure out all-metal construction on our own?

540
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:04,702
We can't learn anything from this.

541
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,038
These are just pretty equations.

542
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,709
"This technology belongs to Germany."

543
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,713
Maybe we don't even need their technology.

544
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,549
Wood and canvas could be as good as metal.

545
00:51:18,627 --> 00:51:20,825
Then we'll never make it.

546
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:23,043
We're already 20 years behind.

547
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,393
Let's take a walk.

548
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,563
My brain is boiling.

549
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:45,034
We're Achilles, chasing a tortoise with a twenty-year lead.

550
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:50,372
If we close the gap in five years...

551
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:53,042
he'll be five more years down the road.

552
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,378
We'll always be chasing him.

553
00:51:56,404 --> 00:52:01,342
Someday we'll overtake him and move ahead.

554
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:05,220
I wonder if we can be the tortoise.

555
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,062
What?

556
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,317
Listen to that.

557
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:25,326
Schubert's "Winter Journey".

558
00:52:25,346 --> 00:52:27,231
It's perfect for us.

559
00:52:50,468 --> 00:52:52,187
- What was that about?

560
00:52:52,207 --> 00:52:53,926
- We saw him in the hangar.

561
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,496
Jiro?

562
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:57,001
I'm done.

563
00:53:57,021 --> 00:53:58,489
Go have a bath.

564
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,673
Dead to the world...

565
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:09,178
with a face like he's carrying the future of Japanese aviation.

566
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,683
There's a telegram from headquarters.

567
00:54:14,886 --> 00:54:15,708
- Come in.

568
00:54:15,728 --> 00:54:16,550
- Not necessary.

569
00:54:16,638 --> 00:54:18,732
Some of us are returning immediately.

570
00:54:18,752 --> 00:54:20,846
You're staying behind.

571
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,359
Jiro will continue west and return to Japan.

572
00:54:24,479 --> 00:54:25,905
- West?

573
00:54:25,925 --> 00:54:27,351
- They want him to see the world.

574
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,031
All by himself?

575
00:54:55,593 --> 00:54:56,227
Mr.

576
00:54:56,247 --> 00:54:56,881
Caproni.

577
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,186
Is the wind still rising?

578
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,772
Yes, it is.

579
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,319
Then I invite you to join me on my final flight.

580
00:55:04,339 --> 00:55:06,558
Come.

581
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,570
You're retiring?

582
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,907
It's a big jump.

583
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,412
Jump!

584
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:28,197
Hurry.

585
00:55:28,217 --> 00:55:29,498
We're taking off.

586
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:33,512
There's a hatch under the fuselage.

587
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,430
Hurry!

588
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,807
Let me through.

589
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,100
Up here!

590
00:55:46,311 --> 00:55:47,228
- Full power!

591
00:55:47,248 --> 00:55:48,165
- Fly!

592
00:55:48,185 --> 00:55:49,102
Fly!

593
00:55:56,321 --> 00:55:58,728
My workmen's families and relatives.

594
00:55:58,748 --> 00:56:01,155
Practically the whole village.

595
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,792
We're taking a private jaunt...

596
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:07,629
before we deliver this bomber to the Air Force.

597
00:56:13,338 --> 00:56:14,723
- What do you think?

598
00:56:14,743 --> 00:56:16,128
- It's incredible.

599
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,641
It's like a building out of ancient Rome.

600
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:23,312
This plane is too large to be used for war...

601
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,856
but the Air Force likes everything big.

602
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,817
Japan is poor and backward.

603
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,821
We could never build something like this.

604
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,949
The important thing for an engineer is inspiration.

605
00:56:36,194 --> 00:56:38,434
Inspiration unlocks the future.

606
00:56:38,454 --> 00:56:40,694
Technology will catch up.

607
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,167
My wife and family.

608
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:47,923
We Italians are also poor.

609
00:56:47,943 --> 00:56:50,163
Too many mouths to feed.

610
00:56:55,547 --> 00:56:57,515
Hey, settle down.

611
00:56:57,535 --> 00:56:59,503
The bottom will fall out.

612
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,516
Come.

613
00:57:05,056 --> 00:57:07,692
Be careful.

614
00:57:07,712 --> 00:57:10,348
This may be a dream, but you can still lose your head.

615
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:24,706
Which would you choose, a world with pyramids or one without them?

616
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,250
Pyramids?

617
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:31,213
Humanity dreams of flight, but the dream is cursed.

618
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:36,051
Aircraft are destined to become tools for slaughter and destruction.

619
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,219
I know.

620
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:41,723
But still, I chose a world with pyramids in it.

621
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,726
Which world will you choose?

622
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:48,230
I want to create beautiful airplanes.

623
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,731
Like that?

624
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,416
Very graceful.

625
00:58:07,452 --> 00:58:09,650
I have a long way to go.

626
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:11,868
I don't even have the engine yet.

627
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:23,018
Bravo!

628
00:58:23,038 --> 00:58:25,258
A beautiful dream.

629
00:58:32,644 --> 00:58:34,362
I'm retiring.

630
00:58:34,382 --> 00:58:36,100
This is my last design.

631
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,614
Artists are only creative for ten years.

632
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,784
We engineers are no different.

633
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:48,123
Live your ten years to the full.

634
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,808
Jiro, we need to talk.

635
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:07,895
- I've got a meeting.

636
00:59:07,915 --> 00:59:08,966
- Cancel it.

637
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,165
- This is a tall order.

638
00:59:27,185 --> 00:59:28,820
- They're always tall.

639
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:31,500
How long have you been with us, Jiro?

640
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:34,002
Jiro?

641
00:59:34,205 --> 00:59:35,340
- How long?

642
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,495
- Five years.

643
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:38,510
You should be ready, then.

644
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,332
We want you to lead the project.

645
00:59:40,378 --> 00:59:42,180
It's the Navy's design competition for 1932.

646
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,002
A carrier-based fighter.

647
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,514
A plum assignment.

648
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,060
Well, Jiro?

649
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,864
What do you think?

650
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,574
Leave it to me.

651
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,034
Good.

652
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,203
I'd like Honjo on the team.

653
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,579
Bad idea.

654
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:11,709
You'd end up competing.

655
01:00:11,729 --> 01:00:13,364
Friendship's more important.

656
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,877
Relax and finish your coffee.

657
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,380
Check, please.

658
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,550
We've got other plans for Honjo.

659
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,098
Damn these Japanese engines!

660
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,944
And damn this short flight deck.

661
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,284
Fresh uniforms!

662
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,328
Oh, thanks.

663
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,966
Thanks for your help.

664
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,301
Those jerseys suit you.

665
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,163
Close the flight deck!

666
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,384
Stop!

667
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:12,947
We did it!

668
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,783
She's airborne!

669
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:22,016
Father!

670
01:06:08,099 --> 01:06:09,755
Bravo!

671
01:06:09,775 --> 01:06:11,431
Nice catch.

672
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:16,824
That was kind of you.

673
01:06:16,844 --> 01:06:18,229
Are you all right?

674
01:06:18,275 --> 01:06:19,077
I'm fine.

675
01:06:19,097 --> 01:06:19,899
Here you are.

676
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:21,579
Thank you.

677
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,067
It belongs to the hotel.

678
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,579
Well, goodbye.

679
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:41,095
Father, I'm afraid I was rude to that man.

680
01:06:41,298 --> 01:06:42,349
Don't worry.

681
01:06:42,369 --> 01:06:43,420
He's staying at our hotel.

682
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:46,643
You'll have a chance to say thank you.

683
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,934
What is it?

684
01:09:33,137 --> 01:09:35,022
Nothing.

685
01:09:35,042 --> 01:09:36,927
Just that man who caught the parasol.

686
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:40,108
He seems to be here by himself.

687
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,225
I'm sorry.

688
01:10:52,245 --> 01:10:53,380
I'd better go.

689
01:10:54,593 --> 01:10:56,875
No, please stay.

690
01:10:56,895 --> 01:10:59,177
I was giving thanks to the spring.

691
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:03,524
I asked it to bring you here, to me.

692
01:11:06,939 --> 01:11:09,241
You haven't changed at all.

693
01:11:09,261 --> 01:11:11,563
You're just like you were then.

694
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:16,079
We were so grateful for your help after the earthquake.

695
01:11:16,271 --> 01:11:19,415
I wanted to see you again and thank you.

696
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,584
Oh, now I remember.

697
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,587
My name is Nahoko Satomi.

698
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:27,423
Jiro Horikoshi.

699
01:11:49,304 --> 01:11:50,947
Are you all right?

700
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,448
I'm fine.

701
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:58,788
Kinu got married two days after she dropped off your shirt.

702
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,542
She cried for joy when we found you.

703
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:06,129
You were our knight in shining armor.

704
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,296
Your knight?

705
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:10,800
You were like a knight on a white horse that day.

706
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,636
This umbrella sure does leak.

707
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,304
It's all right.

708
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,306
I've got to tell Kinu.

709
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:20,810
She just had her second child.

710
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,937
It's such a cute baby.

711
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,651
Your painting is all wet.

712
01:12:28,687 --> 01:12:30,239
Yes.

713
01:12:30,259 --> 01:12:31,811
I'll keep it this way in honor of today.

714
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,157
Look, it's clearing up.

715
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:42,832
The rain stopped here.

716
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,669
Oh, look at that.

717
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,180
I'd almost forgotten what rainbows look like.

718
01:12:57,372 --> 01:12:59,682
Life is wonderful, isn't it?

719
01:13:01,053 --> 01:13:02,688
We'd better go.

720
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:04,343
Father's probably worried sick.

721
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,193
There's my father.

722
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:12,695
Father!

723
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:16,199
Come, I'll introduce you.

724
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,369
You're soaking wet.

725
01:13:20,405 --> 01:13:21,671
Don't worry, Father.

726
01:13:21,691 --> 01:13:22,957
I'm fine.

727
01:13:22,977 --> 01:13:24,243
Mr.

728
01:13:24,263 --> 01:13:25,529
Horikoshi saved me again.

729
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,043
Jiro Horikoshi.

730
01:13:27,079 --> 01:13:29,360
Satomi.

731
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:31,661
I'm afraid my daughter has caused you trouble again.

732
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,928
May I sit here?

733
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:21,931
Certainly.

734
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:40,095
German tobacco.

735
01:14:40,115 --> 01:14:41,560
Last one.

736
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,025
Too bad.

737
01:14:43,655 --> 01:14:45,958
I know how you feel.

738
01:14:45,978 --> 01:14:48,281
The same thing happened to me.

739
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:50,837
You visit Germany, yes?

740
01:14:50,857 --> 01:14:53,034
To Dessau.

741
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,549
You must be Sherlock Holmes.

742
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,968
You are an engineer.

743
01:14:59,171 --> 01:15:01,223
You read German magazines.

744
01:15:01,243 --> 01:15:03,295
Magazines about airplanes.

745
01:15:03,498 --> 01:15:07,310
All Japanese engineers visit Dessau.

746
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:11,314
You're exactly right.

747
01:15:12,517 --> 01:15:13,865
- Dr.

748
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:15,233
Junkers is in trouble.

749
01:15:15,253 --> 01:15:16,601
- What kind of trouble?

750
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:20,493
He fights the government.

751
01:15:20,513 --> 01:15:22,316
He will blow up.

752
01:15:22,861 --> 01:15:23,829
Mr.

753
01:15:23,849 --> 01:15:24,817
Hitler's government?

754
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:28,331
The Nazis are a gang of hoodlums.

755
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:31,167
This is a good place.

756
01:15:31,203 --> 01:15:32,731
No mosquitoes.

757
01:15:32,751 --> 01:15:34,279
Not hot.

758
01:15:34,299 --> 01:15:35,827
Good watercress.

759
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:38,799
A good place to forget bad things.

760
01:15:39,044 --> 01:15:40,179
Cigarette?

761
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:41,334
I'm afraid they're Japanese.

762
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,678
Thank you.

763
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:50,272
It is a nice night.

764
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:52,344
Hier ist der Zauberberg.

765
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,565
"The Magic Mountain" by Thomas Mann?

766
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,360
A good place for forgetting.

767
01:15:57,729 --> 01:15:59,197
Make a war in China.

768
01:15:59,217 --> 01:16:00,685
Forget it.

769
01:16:01,066 --> 01:16:02,492
Make a puppet state in Manchuria.

770
01:16:02,512 --> 01:16:03,938
Forget it.

771
01:16:04,403 --> 01:16:05,871
Quit the League of Nations.

772
01:16:05,891 --> 01:16:07,359
Forget it.

773
01:16:07,406 --> 01:16:08,791
Make the world your enemy.

774
01:16:08,811 --> 01:16:10,196
Forget it.

775
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,875
Japan will blow up.

776
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,878
Germany will blow up too.

777
01:16:16,248 --> 01:16:17,665
- Will Germany go to war again?

778
01:16:17,685 --> 01:16:19,102
- Yes.

779
01:16:19,122 --> 01:16:20,539
They must be stopped.

780
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,762
I'm sorry to keep you waiting so long.

781
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,390
Nahoko has a fever.

782
01:16:27,582 --> 01:16:30,559
I'm afraid we'll have to cancel our dinner plans.

783
01:16:30,929 --> 01:16:32,731
I'm sorry.

784
01:16:32,751 --> 01:16:34,553
Please tell her I hope she feels better.

785
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,485
I must go.

786
01:16:36,505 --> 01:16:37,890
The doctor will be here soon.

787
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,519
"Who has seen the wind?"

788
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,688
"Neither I nor you."

789
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:44,860
"But when the leaves hang trembling, the wind is passing through."

790
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:52,701
Let the wind carry...

791
01:18:53,728 --> 01:18:55,913
these wings to you.

792
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,450
Jiro?

793
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,910
Nahoko!

794
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:56,765
Be careful!

795
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:57,803
Nice catch.

796
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:14,630
Bravo!

797
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,466
Is the young lady feeling better?

798
01:23:17,992 --> 01:23:19,968
Yes, she's much better.

799
01:23:19,994 --> 01:23:21,470
Congratulations.

800
01:23:22,173 --> 01:23:23,725
This is the magic mountain.

801
01:23:23,745 --> 01:23:25,297
It cures everyone.

802
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,476
I think you're right.

803
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:32,314
At first, this young man was very gloomy.

804
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,483
Now he is very happy.

805
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:36,693
He has fallen in love.

806
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:38,654
That's true.

807
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,658
Summer love is soon forgotten.

808
01:23:42,694 --> 01:23:44,579
You will go down the mountain.

809
01:23:44,599 --> 01:23:46,484
You will forget what happened here.

810
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:48,664
Not me.

811
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:53,502
This person you're talking about wouldn't be my daughter, would it?

812
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,838
Yes, it's Nahoko.

813
01:23:57,532 --> 01:24:00,217
Please give us your permission.

814
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:02,845
But...

815
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,179
Father!

816
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,267
I would like to accept.

817
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,519
What a beauty.

818
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:16,859
But first, there's something I have to tell you.

819
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:17,985
Yes?

820
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:22,197
Two years ago, my mother died of tuberculosis.

821
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:25,200
I contracted it too.

822
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:29,955
I've loved you since that day you rescued my hat.

823
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:34,376
I've loved you since the wind brought you to me.

824
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:36,879
Please marry me.

825
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:38,005
I will.

826
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:40,114
But I want to get well first.

827
01:24:40,134 --> 01:24:42,207
Can you wait for me?

828
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:45,220
Even if it takes a hundred years.

829
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,389
Congratulations.

830
01:24:47,425 --> 01:24:49,770
He is a nice young man.

831
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:52,135
Your daughter is wonderful.

832
01:24:53,087 --> 01:24:56,106
This is a good summer.

833
01:25:18,289 --> 01:25:19,841
- Jiro, over here!

834
01:25:19,861 --> 01:25:21,413
- Honjo!

835
01:25:21,459 --> 01:25:22,594
- When did you get back?

836
01:25:22,614 --> 01:25:23,749
- Two days ago.

837
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,427
Hot, isn't it?

838
01:25:28,122 --> 01:25:30,098
Come take a look.

839
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,271
She's beautiful.

840
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,440
Good clean lines.

841
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:43,949
It's a radical design.

842
01:25:43,969 --> 01:25:45,938
They gave me free rein.

843
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,284
But we won't know until she flies.

844
01:25:49,821 --> 01:25:51,539
She'll fly.

845
01:25:51,559 --> 01:25:53,277
I feel the wind rising.

846
01:26:14,178 --> 01:26:16,230
You're the Japanese Achilles.

847
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:18,302
You've closed the gap.

848
01:26:19,173 --> 01:26:21,149
My plane was just a tin duckling.

849
01:26:21,175 --> 01:26:22,985
I have an idea for you.

850
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,654
I haven't tried it yet.

851
01:26:28,182 --> 01:26:30,993
Use flathead screws on the access hatches.

852
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,828
They'll reduce drag.

853
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:37,499
Maintenance will be easy with a hinge on one side.

854
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:45,507
A spring about this stiff should be fine.

855
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:49,428
That's a great idea, like Columbus and his egg.

856
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:50,679
You should use it.

857
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,348
Thanks, but not this time.

858
01:26:55,209 --> 01:26:56,810
I'll keep the plans.

859
01:26:56,878 --> 01:27:00,188
After you use it, I'll use it too.

860
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:02,357
Okay.

861
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:04,985
Hurry up, I'll be waiting.

862
01:27:05,563 --> 01:27:06,698
Jiro!

863
01:27:06,718 --> 01:27:07,853
Are you here?

864
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:09,617
Jiro, it's Mr.

865
01:27:09,637 --> 01:27:10,855
Kurokawa.

866
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:12,200
It's an emergency.

867
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:13,535
See you.

868
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:15,537
Visit the house next time.

869
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,372
Jiro, you pedal.

870
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:25,047
The Special Police are looking for you.

871
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,383
The thought crime boys.

872
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,218
Why me?

873
01:27:30,244 --> 01:27:32,554
I told them you were away on business.

874
01:27:43,768 --> 01:27:45,236
Pretending to leave?

875
01:27:45,256 --> 01:27:46,724
We won't fall for that.

876
01:27:46,938 --> 01:27:48,239
You'd better work here.

877
01:27:48,259 --> 01:27:49,560
We'll bring your things.

878
01:27:49,607 --> 01:27:51,075
What's going on?

879
01:27:51,095 --> 01:27:52,563
Why are they after me?

880
01:27:52,944 --> 01:27:55,497
They arrested some of my friends.

881
01:27:55,517 --> 01:27:58,070
None of them understood why.

882
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,582
Come in.

883
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:02,084
Here's your stuff.

884
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,921
Sorry for the bother.

885
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,589
Need anything else?

886
01:28:07,792 --> 01:28:09,177
- Just leave it and go.

887
01:28:09,197 --> 01:28:10,582
- Jiro, it's here!

888
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,594
The prototype flange.

889
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:24,439
It looks great.

890
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,441
Wish we'd had it last year.

891
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,235
Jiro, what do you think?

892
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:32,614
Our next plane will be a full-grown duck, not a duckling.

893
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,951
A full metal duck.

894
01:28:35,987 --> 01:28:36,830
How about it, Mr.

895
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:37,693
Kurokawa?

896
01:28:38,156 --> 01:28:39,517
Extruded aluminum alloy.

897
01:28:39,537 --> 01:28:40,898
Very light.

898
01:28:40,918 --> 01:28:42,279
What a luxury.

899
01:28:42,316 --> 01:28:44,042
All right, back to work.

900
01:28:55,882 --> 01:28:57,246
- The coast looks clear.

901
01:28:57,266 --> 01:28:58,630
- Okay, Jiro.

902
01:29:00,376 --> 01:29:03,145
Better lie low for a few days.

903
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,313
We'll smooth things over.

904
01:29:05,381 --> 01:29:07,149
I'll put you up.

905
01:29:07,226 --> 01:29:08,736
Let me stop by my apartment.

906
01:29:08,756 --> 01:29:10,266
I'm expecting a letter.

907
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:12,654
Is it something sensitive?

908
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,322
Yes, very sensitive.

909
01:29:14,557 --> 01:29:16,658
The police will be opening your mail.

910
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:18,243
It's from my fiancée.

911
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:21,997
Such things shouldn't happen in a modern country.

912
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:25,500
You're engaged?

913
01:29:26,245 --> 01:29:27,359
- Jiro's human after all.

914
01:29:27,379 --> 01:29:28,493
- Splendid.

915
01:29:28,571 --> 01:29:30,839
You think Japan's a modern country?

916
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:32,382
It's not funny.

917
01:29:32,585 --> 01:29:34,283
Of course it's not funny.

918
01:29:34,303 --> 01:29:36,001
The police are waiting for you.

919
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:38,388
Let them read your love letters.

920
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:42,017
The Navy's next design competition is in your hands.

921
01:29:42,261 --> 01:29:44,626
The company will protect you.

922
01:29:44,646 --> 01:29:47,011
That is, as long as you're useful.

923
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:49,524
Just keep your mind on work.

924
01:29:50,603 --> 01:29:51,784
I miss you terribly.

925
01:29:51,804 --> 01:29:52,985
And "Mr.

926
01:29:53,005 --> 01:29:54,186
Castorp" left so suddenly.

927
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:57,699
Why are they looking for him?

928
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:15,133
I pray that he managed to leave Japan safely.

929
01:30:32,468 --> 01:30:34,236
Jiro, telephone for you.

930
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:35,904
Coming.

931
01:30:36,649 --> 01:30:37,679
- The telephone is there.

932
01:30:37,699 --> 01:30:38,729
- Thank you.

933
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:42,223
- Hello?

934
01:30:42,243 --> 01:30:43,396
- Jiro?

935
01:30:43,416 --> 01:30:44,569
You have a telegram.

936
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:45,705
What?

937
01:30:45,741 --> 01:30:47,981
Your landlord brought it.

938
01:30:48,001 --> 01:30:50,241
It came two days ago.

939
01:30:50,653 --> 01:30:51,920
Please read it.

940
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:53,255
Are you sure?

941
01:30:55,324 --> 01:31:00,011
"Nahoko... has had a lung... hemorrhage."

942
01:31:00,047 --> 01:31:03,828
"Please come at once.

943
01:31:03,848 --> 01:31:07,629
Satomi" Hello?

944
01:31:07,649 --> 01:31:11,430
Are you there?

945
01:31:12,185 --> 01:31:13,215
I understand.

946
01:31:13,235 --> 01:31:14,265
Thank you.

947
01:31:14,343 --> 01:31:15,944
Wait, hold on!

948
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:19,781
What is it?

949
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:24,035
What's the fastest way to get to Tokyo?

950
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,620
To Tokyo?

951
01:31:25,688 --> 01:31:28,290
I have to be there as soon as possible.

952
01:31:28,357 --> 01:31:30,125
Let me see.

953
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:34,462
If you take the noon bus, you can catch the express.

954
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:37,632
I'll send someone to hold the bus for you.

955
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:39,301
Jiya!

956
01:33:26,809 --> 01:33:27,909
Darling!

957
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:40,088
I wish I could've come sooner.

958
01:33:45,661 --> 01:33:47,262
You'll catch it.

959
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:48,930
You're beautiful.

960
01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:51,099
I love you.

961
01:33:53,346 --> 01:33:54,293
Jiro?

962
01:33:54,313 --> 01:33:55,260
Through the garden?

963
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:06,281
Come in.

964
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:10,952
Father, Jiro came to see me.

965
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:13,621
But he has to leave right away.

966
01:34:14,033 --> 01:34:16,148
- Next time I'll use the front door.

967
01:34:16,168 --> 01:34:18,283
- Use the garden, it's more fun.

968
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:20,295
All right, I will.

969
01:34:20,529 --> 01:34:22,630
Take care, darling.

970
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:24,299
You too.

971
01:34:25,701 --> 01:34:27,302
Goodbye.

972
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,636
I'll see you out.

973
01:34:33,886 --> 01:34:35,417
The last train?

974
01:34:35,437 --> 01:34:36,968
You'd better hurry.

975
01:34:38,766 --> 01:34:40,693
Is it that serious?

976
01:34:40,713 --> 01:34:42,640
I wish I could look after her.

977
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:46,154
The way to do that is to focus on your work.

978
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:47,989
Now you'd better go.

979
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:56,998
He's gone.

980
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,001
Are you crying, dear?

981
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:07,342
I'm going to the sanatorium the doctor recommended.

982
01:35:07,586 --> 01:35:09,284
But it's so lonely.

983
01:35:09,304 --> 01:35:11,002
You'll be all by yourself.

984
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:13,515
I want to get better.

985
01:35:13,707 --> 01:35:15,850
I want a life with Jiro.

986
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:22,798
You're just in time.

987
01:35:22,818 --> 01:35:24,516
The board is waiting.

988
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:33,284
So, are you ready?

989
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:35,787
I'll do my best.

990
01:35:35,948 --> 01:35:37,312
Now the Navy.

991
01:35:37,332 --> 01:35:38,696
They're the client.

992
01:35:49,618 --> 01:35:51,302
I'll do my best.

993
01:35:51,338 --> 01:35:52,681
- You weren't even listening.

994
01:35:52,701 --> 01:35:54,044
- Right.

995
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:58,726
So I gave up on that idea.

996
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:02,754
- Everyone's here rather late.

997
01:36:02,774 --> 01:36:04,889
- Jiro's holding a design seminar.

998
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:10,405
The next design uses all the latest technology.

999
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:12,223
- Take a look.

1000
01:36:12,243 --> 01:36:13,566
- Retractable undercarriage!

1001
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:16,244
We'll need it for 270 knots.

1002
01:36:16,489 --> 01:36:18,082
270 knots?

1003
01:36:18,102 --> 01:36:19,695
That's 500 kilometers an hour!

1004
01:36:19,982 --> 01:36:22,458
I thought the Navy requested 220 knots.

1005
01:36:22,985 --> 01:36:25,420
We're designing for the future.

1006
01:36:25,988 --> 01:36:28,590
Wing loading is 120 kilos per square meter.

1007
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:33,261
We'll minimize drag and push the limits of technology.

1008
01:36:33,829 --> 01:36:36,764
She'll have split flaps and leading edge slats.

1009
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:55,116
We can do it!

1010
01:36:55,434 --> 01:36:57,493
When do we start?

1011
01:36:58,187 --> 01:37:00,496
But then weight becomes a problem.

1012
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:06,628
If we leave out the guns, we should be okay.

1013
01:37:12,868 --> 01:37:16,137
I decided to set this idea aside for now.

1014
01:37:17,216 --> 01:37:18,246
This is delightful.

1015
01:37:18,266 --> 01:37:19,296
Lucid and logical.

1016
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:20,892
Almost had it.

1017
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:23,436
Our engines are underpowered.

1018
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:26,648
To compensate, we need a light, strong structure.

1019
01:37:26,715 --> 01:37:30,985
We'll cut excess weight and minimize drag with a smooth skin.

1020
01:37:31,053 --> 01:37:33,821
We're going to build an all-metal fighter...

1021
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:36,157
like nothing the world's ever seen.

1022
01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:38,326
I have a question!

1023
01:37:38,571 --> 01:37:39,351
Mr.

1024
01:37:39,371 --> 01:37:40,151
Hirayama, please.

1025
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:42,771
Mr.

1026
01:37:42,791 --> 01:37:44,322
Hirayama is our production engineer.

1027
01:37:44,733 --> 01:37:45,625
Thank you.

1028
01:37:47,861 --> 01:37:50,838
He's going to tell us about the new rivets.

1029
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:57,136
It's technically possible to build strong structures with flush rivets.

1030
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:58,680
What's he talking about?

1031
01:37:59,081 --> 01:38:00,640
A way to cut drag.

1032
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:06,229
We're going to skin the whole aircraft with flush rivets.

1033
01:38:06,265 --> 01:38:07,463
- Question!

1034
01:38:07,483 --> 01:38:08,681
- I have a question!

1035
01:38:11,093 --> 01:38:13,528
I must say, that was interesting.

1036
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:15,196
It was inspiring.

1037
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:37,552
Today's letter, Miss Satomi.

1038
01:38:37,786 --> 01:38:39,554
Thank you.

1039
01:39:59,034 --> 01:40:00,635
Phone call, Chief.

1040
01:40:00,879 --> 01:40:02,389
- I'll call back.

1041
01:40:02,409 --> 01:40:03,919
- I think it's an emergency.

1042
01:40:04,049 --> 01:40:05,119
Hello?

1043
01:40:05,139 --> 01:40:06,209
Mr.

1044
01:40:06,229 --> 01:40:07,299
Satomi?

1045
01:40:07,876 --> 01:40:09,477
What?!

1046
01:41:22,294 --> 01:41:23,324
Jiro!

1047
01:41:23,344 --> 01:41:24,374
Jiro!

1048
01:41:24,630 --> 01:41:26,411
Thank goodness.

1049
01:41:26,431 --> 01:41:28,212
I worried I wouldn't find you.

1050
01:41:29,927 --> 01:41:31,312
I'm here now.

1051
01:41:31,332 --> 01:41:32,717
Can you walk?

1052
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:35,062
Let's go.

1053
01:41:42,189 --> 01:41:43,782
I just had to see you.

1054
01:41:43,802 --> 01:41:45,395
I should go right back.

1055
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:46,407
Don't go.

1056
01:41:50,145 --> 01:41:51,913
We should be together.

1057
01:42:04,503 --> 01:42:05,867
- What a charming companion.

1058
01:42:05,887 --> 01:42:07,251
- My name is Nahoko.

1059
01:42:07,339 --> 01:42:08,703
- So you're Nahoko.

1060
01:42:08,723 --> 01:42:10,087
- Jiro, is that you?

1061
01:42:10,165 --> 01:42:12,433
We've come to you with a request.

1062
01:42:13,345 --> 01:42:14,375
Why not, dear?

1063
01:42:14,395 --> 01:42:15,425
It'll be fine.

1064
01:42:15,504 --> 01:42:17,271
We've got plenty of room...

1065
01:42:17,339 --> 01:42:22,610
but I can hardly approve of an unmarried couple living together.

1066
01:42:23,178 --> 01:42:24,779
We'll get married right away.

1067
01:42:24,815 --> 01:42:25,815
Mr.

1068
01:42:25,835 --> 01:42:26,835
Kurokawa, Mrs.

1069
01:42:26,855 --> 01:42:27,855
Kurokawa, please be our witnesses.

1070
01:42:28,026 --> 01:42:28,723
Here?

1071
01:42:28,743 --> 01:42:29,440
Tonight?

1072
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:31,619
It sounds lovely, dear.

1073
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:35,122
Nahoko was very brave to leave the sanatorium.

1074
01:42:35,534 --> 01:42:37,565
My father's given his permission.

1075
01:42:37,585 --> 01:42:39,616
I've already told the doctor.

1076
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:41,128
Please help us.

1077
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:46,801
The bride and I have preparations to make.

1078
01:42:47,202 --> 01:42:48,803
Come with me, Nahoko.

1079
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,478
Don't worry, he's always like that.

1080
01:43:01,383 --> 01:43:06,320
If you care about her, you'll send her back immediately.

1081
01:43:07,190 --> 01:43:09,410
I can't do that.

1082
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:11,650
I'd have to give up my work.

1083
01:43:11,894 --> 01:43:15,162
Is that your heart or your ego talking?

1084
01:43:16,074 --> 01:43:17,731
We don't have much time.

1085
01:43:17,751 --> 01:43:19,408
We've made our decision.

1086
01:43:20,569 --> 01:43:21,836
I see.

1087
01:43:22,581 --> 01:43:23,861
All right.

1088
01:43:23,881 --> 01:43:25,161
We'll have a real ceremony!

1089
01:43:49,848 --> 01:43:51,198
Here they come.

1090
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:53,701
She's coming!

1091
01:44:12,965 --> 01:44:15,580
Hear me!

1092
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,215
This lovely maiden has traveled far to join her beloved.

1093
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:21,169
She's given up everything in the world for him.

1094
01:44:21,189 --> 01:44:23,888
What say you?

1095
01:44:24,309 --> 01:44:25,840
Hear me!

1096
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:27,391
This man is an insensitive simpleton...

1097
01:44:27,469 --> 01:44:29,737
without a home of his own.

1098
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:33,240
If that's... uh, okay with you, please come in.

1099
01:44:33,308 --> 01:44:36,911
Then they shall exchange the marriage vows.

1100
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:00,935
You look beautiful.

1101
01:45:37,549 --> 01:45:38,579
Mr. and Mrs.

1102
01:45:38,599 --> 01:45:39,629
Kurokawa.

1103
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:44,979
No words can express our gratitude for your kindness.

1104
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:47,648
We will never forget our debt to you.

1105
01:45:50,385 --> 01:45:55,489
Come now, we're delighted that Jiro's found such a wonderful partner.

1106
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:56,657
Aren't we, dear?

1107
01:45:56,735 --> 01:45:58,138
Of course.

1108
01:45:58,158 --> 01:45:59,561
This is wonderful.

1109
01:45:59,581 --> 01:46:00,984
You're both very courageous.

1110
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:18,179
You must be tired.

1111
01:46:18,590 --> 01:46:20,621
I feel like I'm dreaming.

1112
01:46:20,641 --> 01:46:22,672
The room is spinning.

1113
01:46:22,918 --> 01:46:25,144
Better get some rest.

1114
01:46:26,254 --> 01:46:27,271
Come here.

1115
01:46:27,589 --> 01:46:29,023
But your condition...

1116
01:46:31,093 --> 01:46:32,359
Come.

1117
01:47:14,052 --> 01:47:16,737
Do you always get home this late?

1118
01:47:16,763 --> 01:47:18,447
Kayo, I completely forgot.

1119
01:47:18,723 --> 01:47:20,699
You're so insensitive.

1120
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:25,037
Congratulations on becoming a doctor.

1121
01:47:25,063 --> 01:47:28,040
Congratulations on your marriage.

1122
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:31,877
I came on behalf of the family to thank the Kurokawas.

1123
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:33,379
Are they still up?

1124
01:47:33,488 --> 01:47:35,047
They've gone to bed.

1125
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:36,301
- Did you meet Nahoko?

1126
01:47:36,321 --> 01:47:37,372
- Yes.

1127
01:47:41,256 --> 01:47:43,726
What are you going to do?

1128
01:47:43,746 --> 01:47:46,216
She's alone in that room all day.

1129
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:50,187
Her condition is much worse than you think.

1130
01:47:50,265 --> 01:47:51,733
I'm an intern.

1131
01:47:51,753 --> 01:47:53,221
I know something about this.

1132
01:47:53,758 --> 01:47:59,071
Did you notice she uses rouge every morning so you won't worry?

1133
01:48:00,442 --> 01:48:02,244
I really like Nahoko.

1134
01:48:02,264 --> 01:48:04,066
She's such a good person.

1135
01:48:04,102 --> 01:48:06,370
How can you do this to her?

1136
01:48:10,817 --> 01:48:13,252
Does she really have to stay here?

1137
01:48:13,278 --> 01:48:14,420
Yes.

1138
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:19,758
Each day is very precious to us now.

1139
01:48:22,130 --> 01:48:23,682
Get some rest.

1140
01:48:23,702 --> 01:48:25,254
I'm glad you came to visit.

1141
01:48:40,472 --> 01:48:41,780
I'm home.

1142
01:48:41,816 --> 01:48:42,951
- I was waiting.

1143
01:48:42,971 --> 01:48:44,106
- You should sleep.

1144
01:48:50,325 --> 01:48:51,960
- Should you be up?

1145
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:53,615
- Kayo came today.

1146
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:56,628
We're already best friends.

1147
01:48:57,656 --> 01:49:01,633
She's like the sun, with such a bright future.

1148
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:06,138
She said next time, she'll come as my doctor.

1149
01:49:07,499 --> 01:49:12,311
And your mother made me a chemise and a nightgown.

1150
01:49:12,671 --> 01:49:14,688
Look, they're so warm.

1151
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:16,899
Too bright?

1152
01:49:17,676 --> 01:49:18,901
It's all right.

1153
01:49:21,012 --> 01:49:23,489
I have to finish the design by tomorrow.

1154
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:24,990
For your mackerel bones?

1155
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:26,825
You remembered.

1156
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:30,496
I think it could be a little lighter.

1157
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:34,541
Come a little closer.

1158
01:49:43,868 --> 01:49:45,511
Give me your hand.

1159
01:49:48,707 --> 01:49:53,018
I like to look at you while you work.

1160
01:49:53,545 --> 01:49:58,357
In a one-handed slide rule contest, I'd win first prize for sure.

1161
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:02,528
I think I can make each rib half an ounce lighter.

1162
01:50:02,731 --> 01:50:03,615
Really?

1163
01:50:03,635 --> 01:50:04,519
That's good.

1164
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:06,865
Thirty ribs makes about a pound.

1165
01:50:07,058 --> 01:50:08,492
That's too much.

1166
01:50:08,893 --> 01:50:11,495
Half a pound is enough for two.

1167
01:50:11,896 --> 01:50:16,208
I could eat a pound of mackerel by myself.

1168
01:50:21,916 --> 01:50:23,134
I'll keep holding your hand.

1169
01:50:23,154 --> 01:50:24,372
You should sleep.

1170
01:50:24,419 --> 01:50:26,054
- You won't let go?

1171
01:50:26,074 --> 01:50:27,709
- No, I won't.

1172
01:50:30,091 --> 01:50:31,810
I need a cigarette.

1173
01:50:31,830 --> 01:50:33,549
Can I let go for a minute?

1174
01:50:33,762 --> 01:50:34,980
No.

1175
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,218
Smoke it here.

1176
01:50:36,431 --> 01:50:37,566
- It's not good for you.

1177
01:50:37,586 --> 01:50:38,721
- I don't care.

1178
01:50:58,109 --> 01:50:59,751
Hey, Honjo.

1179
01:50:59,944 --> 01:51:01,420
Can I take a look?

1180
01:51:01,623 --> 01:51:02,609
- Sure.

1181
01:51:02,629 --> 01:51:03,615
How's your bomber?

1182
01:51:03,635 --> 01:51:04,621
- Coming along fine.

1183
01:51:04,793 --> 01:51:06,845
This is avant garde.

1184
01:51:06,865 --> 01:51:08,917
You went all the way.

1185
01:51:12,123 --> 01:51:14,433
So this is flush riveting.

1186
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,269
Feels pretty rough.

1187
01:51:18,296 --> 01:51:20,105
We're still learning the technique.

1188
01:51:20,308 --> 01:51:22,778
You've left the Germans behind.

1189
01:51:22,798 --> 01:51:25,268
I'm still stuck with them.

1190
01:51:27,722 --> 01:51:32,075
This design is you, right down to the mackerel bones.

1191
01:51:34,322 --> 01:51:36,958
Jiro, let me use flush rivets too.

1192
01:51:36,978 --> 01:51:39,614
And your spring-loaded hatches.

1193
01:51:39,661 --> 01:51:40,545
Sure.

1194
01:51:40,565 --> 01:51:41,449
Why not?

1195
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:42,794
A redesign?

1196
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:47,132
Yeah, but they're only letting me modify the fuselage.

1197
01:51:47,492 --> 01:51:48,967
And leave the wings alone?

1198
01:51:49,170 --> 01:51:50,743
That's where the fuel tanks are.

1199
01:51:50,763 --> 01:51:52,336
One hit, and boom.

1200
01:51:52,831 --> 01:51:56,642
To save weight, we're not even shielding the fuel tanks.

1201
01:51:56,678 --> 01:51:58,709
It's Japan's first advanced bomber.

1202
01:51:58,729 --> 01:52:00,760
The Navy's over the moon.

1203
01:52:02,674 --> 01:52:06,652
She's got to fly 3,000 kilometers with a big payload.

1204
01:52:07,011 --> 01:52:09,655
More horsepower alone won't be enough.

1205
01:52:22,777 --> 01:52:24,670
Who are they going to fight?

1206
01:52:24,706 --> 01:52:25,515
China.

1207
01:52:25,535 --> 01:52:26,344
Russia.

1208
01:52:26,364 --> 01:52:27,173
Britain.

1209
01:52:27,193 --> 01:52:28,002
The Netherlands.

1210
01:52:28,022 --> 01:52:28,831
America.

1211
01:52:28,867 --> 01:52:30,342
Japan will blow up.

1212
01:52:31,212 --> 01:52:33,181
We're not arms merchants.

1213
01:52:33,201 --> 01:52:35,170
We just want to build good aircraft.

1214
01:52:35,206 --> 01:52:36,181
You're right.

1215
01:52:36,217 --> 01:52:37,185
See you.

1216
01:52:37,205 --> 01:52:38,173
Get some sleep.

1217
01:52:38,219 --> 01:52:39,208
Sure.

1218
01:52:39,228 --> 01:52:40,217
You too.

1219
01:52:41,379 --> 01:52:42,854
I'm leaving now.

1220
01:52:43,047 --> 01:52:44,356
Good night.

1221
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:45,899
Night.

1222
01:53:11,075 --> 01:53:12,718
Welcome home.

1223
01:53:13,087 --> 01:53:14,639
It's finished.

1224
01:53:14,659 --> 01:53:16,211
Now we'll see how she flies.

1225
01:53:16,424 --> 01:53:17,976
Congratulations.

1226
01:53:17,996 --> 01:53:19,548
You worked so hard.

1227
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:23,103
She's on her way to the field.

1228
01:53:23,254 --> 01:53:25,897
I'll probably spend a few nights there.

1229
01:53:26,758 --> 01:53:28,567
You must be tired.

1230
01:53:30,762 --> 01:53:32,362
A little.

1231
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:34,573
I'm sure it will fly beautifully.

1232
01:53:34,933 --> 01:53:37,367
Yes, she'll fly.

1233
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,954
I couldn't have done it without you.

1234
01:53:41,272 --> 01:53:43,415
I love you, Jiro.

1235
01:53:44,108 --> 01:53:45,584
Nahoko...

1236
01:54:38,663 --> 01:54:39,971
I'm off.

1237
01:54:39,998 --> 01:54:41,473
Good luck.

1238
01:55:07,869 --> 01:55:08,774
Why, Nahoko.

1239
01:55:08,794 --> 01:55:09,699
You're up.

1240
01:55:10,163 --> 01:55:12,569
I'm feeling much better today.

1241
01:55:12,589 --> 01:55:14,995
I'm going for a walk.

1242
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:18,009
Just be careful not to tire yourself.

1243
01:55:19,047 --> 01:55:21,182
The room's still a mess.

1244
01:55:21,202 --> 01:55:23,337
I'll straighten up when I get back.

1245
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:24,873
All right.

1246
01:55:24,893 --> 01:55:26,006
Enjoy yourself.

1247
01:55:26,054 --> 01:55:27,439
Kayo's coming today.

1248
01:55:27,459 --> 01:55:28,844
That will be nice.

1249
01:55:29,057 --> 01:55:30,025
Yes.

1250
01:55:30,045 --> 01:55:31,013
I'll be back soon.

1251
01:56:12,423 --> 01:56:14,566
Please come in.

1252
01:56:20,598 --> 01:56:22,574
Oh, no.

1253
01:56:31,119 --> 01:56:32,796
Look, she left letters!

1254
01:56:32,816 --> 01:56:34,493
One of them's for me.

1255
01:56:40,294 --> 01:56:42,430
She's going to the sanatorium!

1256
01:56:42,450 --> 01:56:44,586
I'll bring her back.

1257
01:56:44,799 --> 01:56:45,517
No!

1258
01:56:45,537 --> 01:56:46,255
Let her go.

1259
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:52,771
We shouldn't do anything until her train leaves.

1260
01:56:54,298 --> 01:56:58,109
She wants him to remember her as she was.

1261
01:57:44,942 --> 01:57:46,849
This is wonderful.

1262
01:57:46,869 --> 01:57:48,776
Just think, that's one of ours.

1263
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:50,996
How's her speed?

1264
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:52,876
Sorry, the numbers are too high.

1265
01:57:52,896 --> 01:57:54,573
We're checking them again.

1266
01:57:54,692 --> 01:57:56,001
How fast?

1267
01:57:56,037 --> 01:57:57,672
- 240 knots.

1268
01:57:57,692 --> 01:57:59,327
- Two forty!

1269
01:58:34,450 --> 01:58:35,981
- Fantastic!

1270
01:58:36,001 --> 01:58:37,532
- What a fighter.

1271
01:58:38,736 --> 01:58:40,211
Hey, Jiro.

1272
01:58:40,571 --> 01:58:41,880
Jiro!

1273
01:58:49,757 --> 01:58:51,225
She flies like a dream.

1274
01:58:51,245 --> 01:58:52,713
Thank you.

1275
02:00:05,364 --> 02:00:08,842
We meet again, Japanese boy.

1276
02:00:10,004 --> 02:00:10,638
Mr.

1277
02:00:10,658 --> 02:00:11,292
Caproni...

1278
02:00:14,916 --> 02:00:18,143
This is where we first met.

1279
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:20,645
Our kingdom of dreams.

1280
02:00:21,088 --> 02:00:22,814
Or the land of the dead.

1281
02:00:22,850 --> 02:00:24,318
Not quite.

1282
02:00:24,338 --> 02:00:25,806
In some ways, yes.

1283
02:00:26,177 --> 02:00:30,238
Those ten years in the sun, did you live them to the full?

1284
02:00:30,274 --> 02:00:31,701
Yes.

1285
02:00:31,721 --> 02:00:33,148
Things fell apart toward the end, though.

1286
02:00:33,351 --> 02:00:35,952
That's what it means to lose a war.

1287
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:38,663
There's your Zero fighter.

1288
02:01:16,028 --> 02:01:17,434
Beautiful.

1289
02:01:17,454 --> 02:01:18,860
A masterful design.

1290
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:21,539
Not a single plane returned.

1291
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:24,209
There was nothing to come back to.

1292
02:01:24,412 --> 02:01:25,943
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.

1293
02:01:25,963 --> 02:01:27,494
Cursed dreams...

1294
02:01:27,655 --> 02:01:30,090
waiting for the sky to swallow them up.

1295
02:01:31,659 --> 02:01:33,551
Someone is waiting for you.

1296
02:01:48,634 --> 02:01:49,734
Nahoko...

1297
02:01:49,927 --> 02:01:53,196
She's been waiting here for a long time.

1298
02:01:53,597 --> 02:01:56,074
Darling, you must live.

1299
02:02:00,312 --> 02:02:01,579
You must live...

1300
02:02:23,794 --> 02:02:25,770
She is gone.

1301
02:02:27,131 --> 02:02:29,607
She was beautiful, like the wind.

1302
02:02:30,968 --> 02:02:34,779
Thank you.

1303
02:02:36,223 --> 02:02:38,449
You must live.

1304
02:02:38,652 --> 02:02:40,976
First, shall we drop by my house?

1305
02:02:40,996 --> 02:02:43,320
I have some excellent wine.

1306
02:02:57,078 --> 02:06:22,673
