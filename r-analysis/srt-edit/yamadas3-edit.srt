00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:30,526
A Team Nanban (594mgnav) Release This is the sun, this is the moon, this mountain is really the earth, and this is grandma.

2
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:54,516
My how splendid...

3
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,711
Hello, Mrs.

4
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:57,776
Yamada.

5
00:00:58,156 --> 00:01:01,926
I've never seen such a magnificent...

6
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:04,996
Yup, they're my little babies.

7
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:06,586
What species?

8
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:09,536
This is a Mino Chrysanthemum, this is...

9
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,736
No, I mean the caterpillar.

10
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,176
No idea.

11
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:21,876
Grow into a butterfly just as gaudy as that flower.

12
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:27,356
Mother!

13
00:01:28,386 --> 00:01:30,826
That's our grandma.

14
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:44,766
And my mother and me, Nonoko.

15
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:48,906
What am I going to make for dinner tonight...

16
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:54,101
I know, I'll go for it!

17
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:55,936
Something really special!

18
00:01:56,056 --> 00:01:57,346
What are we having?

19
00:01:57,696 --> 00:01:58,941
We had curry last week.

20
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:00,206
Curry two days ago.

21
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:01,476
Tonight...

22
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,606
Curry!!

23
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:03,786
What...

24
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:18,566
And this is my father and my older brother.

25
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:22,266
What's the use of all this studying, Dad?

26
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:24,936
Listen, Noboru.

27
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,646
Studying is not about what's useful or not.

28
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:33,416
The studying that seems useless may turn out to be useful.

29
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:43,426
On the other hand, it might be that studying that doesn't seem not useful may not be, but then studying that seems useless may then be useful.

30
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,626
But when you really need it, it's not about useful or useless...

31
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:50,796
What are you going on about?

32
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:56,136
So I still have to study.

33
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:28,076
MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS I get it...

34
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:42,856
If my father had been smart and really cool, and my mother had been gorgeous and a great cook, and our family had been rich, my whole life would've been different.

35
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:49,086
If at least one of them...

36
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,566
Don't be ridiculous.

37
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:55,796
If we hadn't married, there'd be no you, and no Nonoko.

38
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:59,196
Without the two of us, you wouldn't be here.

39
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,706
No, that's wrong.

40
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:06,206
If I had cooler parents, I'd just be their kid.

41
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:07,716
How stupid.

42
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:11,616
Don't you know about stamens and pistils?

43
00:04:11,716 --> 00:04:12,706
You tell him.

44
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:14,516
You can't choose your parents.

45
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:16,861
No, I can't accept that.

46
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,106
Something's not right.

47
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:23,396
Because I'm me, Dad's Dad and Mom's Mom.

48
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,596
What is that supposed to mean?

49
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:29,756
Who am I?

50
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:32,836
Where did I come from?

51
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:35,376
Where am I?

52
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:37,866
Who am I?

53
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,076
I get it...

54
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:45,986
So, there was a time when Dad and Mom weren't married.

55
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:14,916
Takashi and Matsuko are off to a great start in their new life.

56
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:17,646
Let's give them a warm send-off.

57
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:23,686
Congratulations, Takashi and Matsuko.

58
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:29,926
I also offer warm wishes to their parents and relatives.

59
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:46,176
Now, your prospects are boundless, and you're embarking for the wide open world, under billowing sails.

60
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:03,086
Life, as they say, has its ups and downs.

61
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:08,436
At times, the waves may taunt you, tossing you in their swells.

62
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,926
But take heart.

63
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:21,576
It's hard to stick with it and make it on your own, but even a couple of losers can survive most things if they're together.

64
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:30,886
So listen, take my advice and have children as soon as you can.

65
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:37,396
Children are the best reason for riding out life's storms.

66
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:54,736
Nowadays people say child-rearing is challenging and difficult, but we've done it from time immemorial.

67
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:58,206
Children grow even without parents.

68
00:07:58,526 --> 00:08:01,856
So hold them close to your heart as they crawl, then walk.

69
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:05,206
They'll be fine.

70
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:19,096
Children make you appreciate your own parents.

71
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:27,136
Parents may seem to do nothing but order you around, but they'll baby-sit your kids and sometimes give them toys.

72
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:35,936
Nowadays young people turn that saying about appreciating parents to their own advantage.

73
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:39,316
But I guess that's part of it too.

74
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:45,256
If things work out, you even get the real estate.

75
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:53,996
So Matsuko and Takashi, start looking after your folks!

76
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:57,566
I hope you know the land is in my name.

77
00:08:57,676 --> 00:09:01,076
Excuse me, mother, but I built this house.

78
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:03,576
Without land, there's no house.

79
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:09,116
And we are grateful to you, but I've worked hard, too.

80
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,916
Your room gets the best light.

81
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:13,616
Thanks for nothing.

82
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:15,726
Of course it does.

83
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:17,736
It's on my land.

84
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:22,126
Besides, why do you always insist you built it by yourself.

85
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:25,526
I hate to contradict you, but I definitely built...

86
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:27,866
That's enough!

87
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:29,436
Both of you.

88
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:31,356
That's right!

89
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:33,186
What's the point of all this bickering!

90
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,836
Listen to Noboru.

91
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:37,036
In the end, it'll all be mine.

92
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:06,396
And what should you fear most on this lifelong voyage?

93
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,276
Wild storms and rip tides?

94
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:19,421
No.

95
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:21,666
Beware the calm waters, when there's hardly a ripple in sight.

96
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:28,926
As long as a family holds each other tight, they can somehow weather the wildest seas.

97
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:31,226
But calm waters are another story.

98
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:37,796
The wind dies down, you sigh and relax, loosening your clasp.

99
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:41,276
But take care, Matsuko and Takashi!

100
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:49,116
If in the calm you selfishly please only yourselves, you may lose each other.

101
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:57,546
You'll never see the sharks gathering around you.

102
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:06,226
And how will you guide your ship?

103
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,696
Without a wind, or even a course?

104
00:11:10,906 --> 00:11:19,176
If you row blindly, right, no, left, no, right after all, you'll never agree.

105
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:24,106
You may even wonder why you're stuck on the same boat at all.

106
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:27,446
Your family's about to fall apart.

107
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:29,386
Turn right there!

108
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:30,426
You sure?

109
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:31,626
Turn left!

110
00:11:31,736 --> 00:11:32,746
Right, right!

111
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:33,776
No, left, left!

112
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:34,886
Which way!

113
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:36,556
Oh dear, maybe right.

114
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,186
Which is it!!??

115
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:48,876
We came so close...

116
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:50,066
Our turn!

117
00:11:50,476 --> 00:12:02,016
A Family Crisis Oh, no, this isn't the way.

118
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:03,586
You should've turned!

119
00:12:03,696 --> 00:12:05,086
No, no, go straight!

120
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:07,496
No, it's that way, are you crazy?

121
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,226
It's this way, Dad!

122
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:10,586
Quiet!

123
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:11,756
All of you.

124
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:15,236
Nonoko's the only one who's quiet.

125
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,366
Hm...she's not here.

126
00:12:20,346 --> 00:12:21,436
What?

127
00:12:21,946 --> 00:12:23,346
Where is she?

128
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:25,376
Stop the car.

129
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:32,386
Where did we lose her?

130
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,886
Noboru, weren't you with her?

131
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:39,526
Yeah, while Dad and I were waiting for you.

132
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:42,596
Maybe she got bored and wandered off.

133
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:45,186
No, I remember her on the bench.

134
00:12:51,406 --> 00:12:53,306
I'm so sorry.

135
00:12:55,076 --> 00:12:57,206
What took you so long?

136
00:12:57,316 --> 00:13:00,146
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

137
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,576
I could have done some shopping, too.

138
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:05,546
I wanted to look at baseball bats.

139
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:13,156
I'm sure she's still there.

140
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:23,836
It's all because you kept yelling about how late we were.

141
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:25,541
Don't blame me.

142
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:27,156
You're the ones who were late.

143
00:13:27,276 --> 00:13:32,676
You all got so excited, you just left poor Nonoko behind.

144
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:36,076
Like you weren't there yourself, grandma.

145
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:39,316
We were looking for your flannel underwear!

146
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:40,921
The store'll close.

147
00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:42,436
I'll never make it.

148
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,926
Stop thinking about yourself.

149
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:48,116
What if something terrible happens to Nonoko?

150
00:13:48,696 --> 00:13:50,186
Something terrible?

151
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:53,626
You don't mean...kidnapped!

152
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:58,636
She's so adorable, just like me.

153
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:02,766
This is no time for jokes!

154
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,166
If only that would work now.

155
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:08,546
What do you mean, that?

156
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:10,376
The PTA mantra.

157
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:17,886
'Don't talk to strangers.' That's what you teach children?

158
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:21,486
It's like saying all strangers are thieves.

159
00:14:21,606 --> 00:14:22,821
Nonoko's fine.

160
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,056
Those teeth!

161
00:14:24,176 --> 00:14:26,091
Hey, cake!

162
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:28,026
Gimmee some!

163
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:30,166
Just one bite.

164
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,396
OK!

165
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,866
One chomp of those teeth!

166
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:36,036
Enough!

167
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:44,246
Please move, our daughter may have been kidnapped!

168
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:49,626
We can't even call.

169
00:14:49,726 --> 00:14:52,386
We should've called before.

170
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:54,056
I told you to buy a cell phone.

171
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,926
You keep quiet!

172
00:14:57,766 --> 00:15:00,926
Oh, Nonoko!

173
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,856
Are you lost?

174
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:33,696
Huh, so you're waiting for someone?

175
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:43,336
Who are you waiting for?

176
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:46,876
Can't you talk?

177
00:15:47,786 --> 00:15:50,046
Then why don't you say anything?

178
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:55,686
I'm not s'pposed to people I don't know.

179
00:15:55,996 --> 00:16:02,616
I know,'Don't talk to strangers.' You're very grown-up, because you're careful.

180
00:16:02,636 --> 00:16:09,256
You can talk now.

181
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,666
You should hear my story.

182
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:16,836
My father and mother and grandma and brother all got lost.

183
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,146
Did you lose someone?

184
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,146
My mommy.

185
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:23,786
Your mommy?

186
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:27,886
My mommy went away...

187
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:32,186
I know...there've been a lot of missing parents lately...

188
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:36,426
But it's only your mom, you'll find her.

189
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:45,236
Excuse me, this is Toshio Kimura.

190
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,436
Can you please call his mom?

191
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,536
Oh, he's lost?

192
00:16:48,646 --> 00:16:51,046
No he's not, they were separated.

193
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,316
Right.

194
00:16:54,896 --> 00:16:56,341
And your first name, Mr.

195
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:57,806
Kimura?

196
00:16:57,996 --> 00:16:58,506
- Toshio.

197
00:16:58,526 --> 00:16:59,036
- Toshio.

198
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:00,616
Toshio, then.

199
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:03,916
Wait here a minute, OK?

200
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:07,731
And you?

201
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:09,046
Are you his sister?

202
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:10,916
No, no relation.

203
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:14,056
My whole family's lost.

204
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:32,676
Poor little, poor little, lost pussy cat...

205
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,356
Stop crying, we're here.

206
00:18:12,036 --> 00:18:13,131
What!

207
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:14,246
She went with her mother!?!

208
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:16,456
I'm her mother!

209
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:18,196
Oh, is that so?

210
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:21,356
How dare you give her to a stranger!

211
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:25,096
It may not have been her mother, but she was no stranger.

212
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:26,496
No stranger?

213
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:27,666
Who could it be?

214
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:29,336
I don't know anyone...

215
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,876
Someone pretending to be friendly...

216
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:38,016
No, she recognized Nonoko.

217
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,146
That wasn't her mother!

218
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:40,341
Calm down!

219
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:41,436
And then?

220
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:44,586
I'm terribly sorry.

221
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:50,896
Nonoko went off happily with someone who seemed like her mother.

222
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:52,886
Oh no...

223
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:54,146
Who can it be...

224
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:56,636
Will you please page Nonoko?

225
00:18:56,806 --> 00:19:00,296
Actually...they went out that exit together.

226
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,236
Not here.

227
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:02,206
Come on!

228
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,976
That's some family...

229
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:21,696
Dad, where are you racing off to?

230
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:22,956
We're chasing it!

231
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:23,756
What?

232
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:26,266
The car Nonoko's in!

233
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,696
What kind of car?

234
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:36,966
We don't even know which way it went!

235
00:19:37,856 --> 00:19:39,381
She'll be fine.

236
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:40,926
Nonoko knew the lady, right?

237
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,076
I bet she took her home.

238
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:45,986
I'm sure Noboru's right.

239
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:49,716
Sure, that must be it.

240
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:51,411
Don't be so sure.

241
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:53,006
You can't trust anyone these days.

242
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:54,356
Mother!

243
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:57,866
Don't you think you should notify the police?

244
00:19:57,966 --> 00:19:59,026
The police!

245
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:00,966
How would we explain?

246
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:03,426
Make a full confession.

247
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:04,436
Confession!

248
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:09,606
That four grown people neglected and abandoned a young girl.

249
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,176
Say, does Nonoko have a key?

250
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:15,536
Let's go home!

251
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,376
Nonoko!

252
00:20:49,646 --> 00:20:53,386
Nonoko!

253
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:54,876
Nonoko!

254
00:20:58,726 --> 00:20:59,746
Nonoko!

255
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,356
Not here.

256
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:07,336
Of course not, it was locked.

257
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:13,736
Hello.

258
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:17,976
Oh, thank goodness!

259
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:19,801
Thank you!

260
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,436
Thank you so much!

261
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:24,686
Thank you!

262
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:26,536
We were looking everywhere for her.

263
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:29,216
I'm so sorry for all this...

264
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:34,896
Yes, we'll be right over.

265
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:38,396
You even made her dinner...

266
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:44,596
You're so very kind, how can we possibly thank you...

267
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:52,606
They finally got home.

268
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:55,306
They're coming right over.

269
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,976
I'm sorry, auntie.

270
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,386
Oh, it's nothing.

271
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:04,386
I can't wait to hear their side of the story.

272
00:22:23,046 --> 00:23:02,646
Look up and see, the blue skies, the white clouds One of these days, it'll all work out - Next stop Luncheon Court.

273
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:16,026
What did you call this stop?

274
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,756
Can you stand back, ma'am?

275
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:27,896
Home Economics Wizard Oh, dear, it started raining.

276
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,316
The laundry!

277
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:42,546
Huh?

278
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:50,126
What's the fuss?

279
00:23:55,776 --> 00:23:56,856
That's right!

280
00:23:56,876 --> 00:23:57,956
I'd already brought it in.

281
00:23:58,076 --> 00:24:00,126
You never even hung it up!

282
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:03,451
I'm going out.

283
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:05,066
Can I get you anything?

284
00:24:05,426 --> 00:24:06,586
Oh!

285
00:24:06,606 --> 00:24:07,766
There was something...

286
00:24:08,596 --> 00:24:10,726
What was it...

287
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:12,876
Um...um...

288
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,716
OK, then, I'm going.

289
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:22,926
It's just that, oh, what was it...

290
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:36,266
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

291
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:38,076
What is it!

292
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,816
Um, that is, um...

293
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,516
Why don't you just give up!

294
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:50,216
Oh, bread!

295
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:55,766
Get it yourself!

296
00:24:56,466 --> 00:24:58,086
Mom!

297
00:24:59,536 --> 00:25:01,096
Money, money.

298
00:25:02,606 --> 00:25:03,896
I'm home.

299
00:25:05,736 --> 00:25:08,136
I guess Mom's not here.

300
00:25:10,306 --> 00:25:11,746
Wow, noodles.

301
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:14,106
And the water's boiling.

302
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:17,446
Great, I'll go ahead and eat'em.

303
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,986
Oh, you're home.

304
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:37,766
You were hiding!

305
00:25:42,746 --> 00:25:43,646
Say.

306
00:25:45,516 --> 00:25:47,106
The bulb's out.

307
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:48,986
That's no good.

308
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,266
Better change it.

309
00:25:51,686 --> 00:25:54,746
Oh, darn...no spares.

310
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:58,016
Just switch it with one you don't use.

311
00:26:00,056 --> 00:26:01,496
Up we go.

312
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:06,556
I'm just borrowing it...

313
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,426

What!

325
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:46,026
Oh, no.

326
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:51,416
Better tidy up a little.

327
00:26:56,886 --> 00:26:57,786
Ouch.

328
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:11,956
Hey, what are you doing?

329
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:14,366
I'll say we're spring cleaning!

331
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:32,986
No, it's not.

332
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:34,561
Are you sure?

333
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:35,676
I know I left it.

334
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:37,556
It isn't here.

335
00:27:38,126 --> 00:27:39,856
Where did you look?

336
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:43,086
It's a manila envelope that says OKK in red.

337
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:45,226
Is this it, sir?

338
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:50,491
Oh, uh...OK.

339
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:53,626
Well, if it's gone, it's gone.

Hey.

Gimme the paper.

344
00:28:01,286 --> 00:28:02,976

No, I've got it.

351
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:35,476
Lettuce, cucumber, ham, light bulbs and garbage bags, right?

352
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:36,906

353
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,616
It's not exactly like I forgot.

354
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:44,486
Lettuce...cucumber...

355

356
00:28:54,306 --> 00:28:55,466
Make up your mind.

357
00:28:55,806 --> 00:28:58,206
Have you decided?

358
00:28:58,506 --> 00:29:00,476
Just hurry up.

Oh, you're still here?

363
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,546
What do you mean,'still'?

364
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:22,426
Can't I rest on my day off?

365
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:25,426
Usually, you're off at Pachinko.

366
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,541
Nope, I'm giving it a rest.

367
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:29,226
How about some tea?

368
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:32,336
And noodles for lunch.

369
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:33,836
Yes, dear.

370
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:38,936
Actually, make that coffee, not tea!

371
00:29:42,786 --> 00:29:46,216
And the bathroom's a wreck.

372
00:29:46,686 --> 00:29:48,086
Clean it up.

373
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:52,016
And when you go shopping I need cigarettes.

374
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:55,026
What a pain in the neck!

375
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,296
Honey, honey...

376
00:30:03,736 --> 00:30:05,496
Where's your mother?

377
00:30:05,676 --> 00:30:07,336
Out playing Pachinko.

378
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,496
It's just about to start.

379
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:46,546
It's not over.

380
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:49,136
But I was looking forward to it.

381
00:30:49,446 --> 00:30:50,346
No.

382
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:51,976
It's a movie!

383
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:27,146
Now nobody can watch.

384
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:29,416
This is much more fun.

385
00:31:45,376 --> 00:31:46,966
I win!

386
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:45,456
Hey, Noboru.

387
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:47,766
Wanna play catch?

388
00:32:48,906 --> 00:32:49,766
Yeah.

389
00:32:49,866 --> 00:33:01,346
Male Bonding No Trespassing Wait, the dad's supposed to be the catcher.

390
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,236
Give me a break.

391
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:12,116
OK, this signal for a curve ball, this for a fastball, and this for a slider.

392
00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:14,226
Give me a break.

393
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:17,356
Two outs, bases loaded, you're the relief pitcher.

394
00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:20,226
I'm the starting pitcher type.

395
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:21,956
Give me a break!

396
00:33:22,136 --> 00:33:23,766
Are you nuts?

397
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:26,366
The team never even lets you pitch.

398
00:33:26,476 --> 00:33:29,336
That's why I want to start now.

399
00:33:30,456 --> 00:33:32,086
I see.

400
00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:33,736
OK, let's see this starting pitcher pitch.

401
00:33:34,786 --> 00:33:37,546
It's still two outs, bases loaded.

402
00:33:37,646 --> 00:33:38,746
What!

403
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:56,796
OK, pitch.

404
00:34:02,146 --> 00:34:03,546
God damn it!

405
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,406
What are you listening to?

406
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,486
Listening over and over will improve my English.

407
00:34:19,096 --> 00:34:20,856
It's not that easy.

408
00:34:20,996 --> 00:34:22,686
In my experience...

409
00:34:22,796 --> 00:34:23,816
Study!

410
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:25,696
Study!

411
00:34:25,796 --> 00:34:29,256
Study!

412
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:52,026
It just doesn't work for me.

413
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:53,356
I'm not you.

414
00:34:59,436 --> 00:35:01,366
How'bout a drop of sake?

415
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,126
Sure.

416
00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:03,756
But, dear.

417
00:35:12,116 --> 00:35:13,636
Pretty awful, huh?

418
00:35:16,216 --> 00:35:17,546
A little dry.

419
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:19,776
What did you say!

420
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:20,786
Have you been...

421
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,186
Noboru!

422
00:35:26,296 --> 00:35:27,756
Noboru!

423
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:39,636
Hey, Noboru, let's play catch.

424
00:35:41,346 --> 00:35:42,436
Why?

425
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:45,701
Why...?

426
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:47,836
It's a form of parent-child bonding.

427
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:51,246
Then it doesn't have to be catch.

428
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:53,776
I get your point, but...

429
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:58,356
It's a matter of setting the right stage.

430
00:35:59,206 --> 00:36:00,196
Forget it.

431
00:36:00,216 --> 00:36:01,206
Can't be bothered.

432
00:36:16,076 --> 00:36:19,066
Kids these days...

433
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:28,016
A serious generation gap...

434
00:36:32,026 --> 00:36:39,526
Paternal Supremacy Restored Don't mix your rice into the soup.

435
00:36:39,636 --> 00:36:41,186
Listen to your father.

436
00:36:42,106 --> 00:36:44,126
Pour the soup over the rice.

437
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:48,776
Excuse me, father...

438
00:36:50,056 --> 00:36:50,766
What?

439
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:51,496
Got a problem with that?

440
00:36:52,246 --> 00:36:53,876
Oh, suit yourself.

441
00:36:59,656 --> 00:37:02,626
See, the water after the cement.

442
00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:05,046
Um...

443
00:37:06,626 --> 00:37:07,856
Hmmm...

444
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,086
Control those chopsticks.

445
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:10,216
It's rude.

446
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:14,156
Use your chopsticks with purpose.

447
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,656
That's my plate.

448
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,166
Excuse me.

449
00:37:20,036 --> 00:37:22,436
You bit it, it's yours.

450
00:37:28,116 --> 00:37:31,086
Help me think of an independent study topic.

451
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,646
Think for yourself.

452
00:37:33,016 --> 00:37:35,506
It's independent, free choice.

453
00:37:35,856 --> 00:37:39,256
I know, but I'm coming up blank.

454
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:42,526
You're free to do anything?

455
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:44,066
Right, free.

456
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:45,356
But...

457
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:51,236
Total freedom makes it tough, doesn't it?

458
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:53,096
Exactly.

459
00:37:54,946 --> 00:37:56,436
Freedom, huh...

460
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:09,886
Absolute freedom of choice...

461
00:38:15,506 --> 00:38:17,671
Glorious freedom...

462
00:38:17,691 --> 00:38:19,856
I dream of freedom...

463
00:38:20,236 --> 00:38:23,426
But when it comes on a silver platter...

464
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:30,576
I haven't got a clue what to do...

465
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:38,176
Now he's a philosopher.

466
00:38:38,486 --> 00:38:41,686
He's probably worrying about his own retirement.

467
00:38:42,726 --> 00:38:59,026
Father as Role Model The first snow!

468
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:13,656
Let's take a picture in it!

469
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:15,976
Why?

470
00:39:16,086 --> 00:39:17,886
You're hardly children anymore.

471
00:39:17,996 --> 00:39:18,976
Shut the door.

472
00:39:18,996 --> 00:39:19,976
It's cold.

473
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:48,486
Where's the camera?

474
00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:51,926
In the top drawer.

475
00:39:58,366 --> 00:39:59,336
Is not!

476
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:06,196
You should know where it is.

477
00:40:08,346 --> 00:40:10,336
This is the best part...

478
00:41:11,776 --> 00:41:35,316
A lone figure Back turned Yamada Family Chronicles Happy New Year New Year's Cards Ready!

479
00:41:36,426 --> 00:41:37,256
Go!

480
00:41:37,366 --> 00:41:39,256
Mine, mine, Mother's, Matsuko's, Nonoko's...

481
00:41:56,196 --> 00:41:57,356
31 seconds!

482
00:41:57,376 --> 00:41:58,536
A new record.

483
00:42:00,156 --> 00:42:01,376
Not bad.

484
00:42:05,496 --> 00:42:14,566
The Thick of Winter Time to get up.

485
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,156
Dad, can you get me some cake?

486
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:17,236
Coke for me.

487
00:42:17,336 --> 00:42:18,196
The tangerines, too.

488
00:42:18,306 --> 00:42:20,636
And the stove needs kerosene.

489
00:42:23,346 --> 00:42:25,746
Thank you!

490
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:42,146
Spring Showers Can you bring my umbrella?

491
00:42:42,266 --> 00:42:45,556
Your father needs his umbrella at the station.

492
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:47,321
Why me?

493
00:42:47,341 --> 00:42:48,816
I'm studying.

494
00:42:48,946 --> 00:42:50,656
You should go.

495
00:42:50,676 --> 00:42:52,386
Walk in the rain with your man.

496
00:42:52,506 --> 00:42:54,976
I just don't have the energy today.

497
00:42:55,076 --> 00:42:55,976
But...

498
00:42:56,086 --> 00:42:57,716
Noboru!

499
00:42:57,736 --> 00:42:59,366
You go, please.

500
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:00,806
Make Nonoko go.

501
00:43:00,926 --> 00:43:02,056
Forget it!

502
00:43:02,076 --> 00:43:03,206
I'll buy one.

503
00:43:03,316 --> 00:43:05,516
Pick up some pork, too?

504
00:43:05,856 --> 00:43:06,746
No Way!

505
00:44:37,116 --> 00:44:38,696
Strange...

506
00:44:38,716 --> 00:44:40,296
Where's Noboru's sock...

507
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:43,676
Nonoko's pajamas and Dad's towel?

508
00:44:44,326 --> 00:44:45,121
Pajamas?

509
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:45,936
Socks?

510
00:44:46,056 --> 00:44:47,646
And his towel.

511
00:44:51,426 --> 00:44:52,946
Hey, wait...

512
00:44:54,756 --> 00:44:56,556
This means...

513
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,196
I knew it!

514
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:07,236
The Black Hole!

515
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:14,206
The Perfect Combo Maybe we'll order sushi in for dinner...

516
00:45:15,596 --> 00:45:17,871
Oh, what a waste of money!

517
00:45:17,891 --> 00:45:20,166
I'll make the sushi.

518
00:45:20,556 --> 00:45:22,386
Just as I hoped...

519
00:45:26,996 --> 00:45:29,116
Say, mother...

520
00:45:29,236 --> 00:45:31,166
Sushi's not interesting.

521
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,116
I thought I'd go gourmet.

522
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:37,896
I see...So what is it?

523
00:45:38,006 --> 00:45:40,836
Beef Stroganoga...

524
00:45:40,936 --> 00:45:43,106
Don't cook what you can't spell.

525
00:45:43,206 --> 00:45:44,606
Well, excuse me!

526
00:45:46,316 --> 00:45:49,546
It's Beef Stroganoff, right?

527
00:45:49,816 --> 00:45:51,576
You knew all along.

528
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:53,586
I know very well.

529
00:45:53,956 --> 00:45:58,516
Beef Stroganoga is just the Strogaffgaff of beef.

530
00:45:58,626 --> 00:46:01,096
Whatever, just make it.

531
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:04,036
Darn.

532
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,686
I was really counting on sushi.

533
00:46:20,726 --> 00:46:21,959
No good.

534
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,212
I screwed it up.

535
00:46:23,232 --> 00:46:24,465
Order the sushi.

536
00:46:25,046 --> 00:46:33,556
Breakfast of Champions Wow, miso soup, fried egg and seaweed.

537
00:46:34,696 --> 00:46:37,026
A real Japanese breakfast.

538
00:46:37,126 --> 00:46:39,186
Well, actually...

539
00:46:41,836 --> 00:46:43,306
Nonoko's leftovers?

540
00:46:45,406 --> 00:46:46,426
Yesterday's soup?

541
00:46:48,006 --> 00:46:49,376
Extra seaweed from lunch?

542
00:46:50,576 --> 00:46:52,236
Precisely!

543
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:55,706
Today's your lucky day.

544
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:57,116
Hardly!

545
00:46:59,786 --> 00:47:01,256
Take care.

546
00:47:03,686 --> 00:47:05,016
Matsuko...

547
00:47:14,196 --> 00:47:16,896
When's lunch, Matsuko?

548
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:21,111
What are you talking about?

549
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:23,426
We just ate.

550
00:47:23,906 --> 00:47:26,176
You're too young to be senile.

551
00:47:26,616 --> 00:47:27,906
You sure...?

552
00:47:28,026 --> 00:47:29,986
The noodles, a few...

553
00:47:30,006 --> 00:47:31,966
Oops!

554
00:47:35,256 --> 00:47:37,386
I ate them all myself...

555
00:47:37,486 --> 00:47:38,456
Hey!

556
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:47,566
What's for dinner?

557
00:47:47,996 --> 00:47:49,226
Shabu shabu.

558
00:47:51,466 --> 00:47:53,806
We have it all the time.

559
00:47:53,906 --> 00:47:56,466
Shabu shabu's perfect for winter.

560
00:48:00,346 --> 00:48:02,436
OK, help yourselves.

561
00:48:03,246 --> 00:48:05,946
This way, she doesn't have to cook.

562
00:48:06,786 --> 00:48:06,816
Cold noodles for lunch again?

563
00:48:06,816 --> 00:48:09,306
Cold noodles for lunch again?

564
00:48:09,426 --> 00:48:11,186
That's what we had yesterday!

565
00:48:11,286 --> 00:48:13,586
And the day before.

566
00:48:13,696 --> 00:48:15,286
That doesn't make sense!

567
00:48:16,626 --> 00:48:18,896
And again tomorrow!?

568
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:20,786
Noodles!

569
00:48:20,806 --> 00:48:22,516
What else?

570
00:48:23,436 --> 00:48:26,366
Lots of free ginger in the garden to go with it.

571
00:48:27,806 --> 00:48:35,146
Ginger Morning The ginger's good in miso soup.

572
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:40,016
Yes, though they do say it makes you forgetful.

573
00:48:40,796 --> 00:48:42,041
Oh dear.

574
00:48:42,061 --> 00:48:43,306
He left his bag.

575
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:45,726
He's bound to notice.

576
00:48:45,746 --> 00:48:47,306
He can't be that dumb.

577
00:48:47,896 --> 00:48:48,726
Right.

578
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:50,386
Oh, no, I forgot...

579
00:49:00,206 --> 00:49:02,266
...to take of my pajamas!

580
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:07,806
I'm off.

581
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:08,976
OK.

582
00:49:11,386 --> 00:49:12,846
Have a nice day.

583
00:49:17,556 --> 00:49:18,816
I'm off.

584
00:49:21,996 --> 00:49:23,226
My shoes!

585
00:49:27,636 --> 00:49:28,996
Mom, look!

586
00:49:30,366 --> 00:49:31,396
Dad!

587
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:33,436
What's all the fuss!

588
00:49:34,176 --> 00:49:34,866
My train!

589
00:49:34,976 --> 00:49:36,206
I'll be late!

590
00:49:36,946 --> 00:49:38,636
Be careful.

591
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,976
I'm off to school.

592
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:46,386
Off you go...

593
00:49:47,486 --> 00:49:51,446
Can't even close the door behind them.

594
00:50:00,996 --> 00:50:02,336
What's this?

595
00:50:02,436 --> 00:50:05,196
Oh, Nonoko forgot her lunch.

596
00:50:05,306 --> 00:50:06,826
She needs it by noon?

597
00:50:06,936 --> 00:50:08,666
Sure, but...

598
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,566
Fine, I'll take it to her when I go shopping.

599
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,166
That'll really be a help.

600
00:50:20,056 --> 00:50:21,386
I'm off.

601
00:50:21,496 --> 00:50:22,696
OK.

602
00:50:22,716 --> 00:50:23,916
Thank you.

603
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,686
What's this?

604
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:37,156
Oh, no, she's forgotten her purse and everything.

605
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:42,206
She'll be back.

606
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:49,076
Watch the house, OK?

607
00:50:53,826 --> 00:50:55,256
Oh no!

608
00:50:55,276 --> 00:50:56,706
I left the kettle on.

609
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:02,901
Mrs.

610
00:51:02,921 --> 00:51:04,386
Yamada, delivery!

611
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,926
Are they out?

612
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:12,696
No, they're in.

613
00:51:13,586 --> 00:51:14,341
Oh, Mrs.

614
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:15,116
Yamada.

615
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,406
Oh, I did turn it off.

616
00:51:23,086 --> 00:51:25,146
Were you robbed?

617
00:51:36,266 --> 00:51:37,786
Here's your package.

618
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:41,166
Oh, thank you.

619
00:51:41,996 --> 00:51:42,826
Your seal...?

620
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:44,406
Oh, sorry.

621
00:51:44,816 --> 00:51:46,746
Let's see...

622
00:51:46,766 --> 00:51:48,696
Where do I keep it?

623
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:52,366
It's in the back of the second drawer.

624
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,306
Oh, goodness...

625
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,776
Always a pleasure.

626
00:51:57,886 --> 00:51:59,116
Thank you.

627
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,286
I delivered Nonoko's lunch.

628
00:52:05,496 --> 00:52:09,796
Why mother, I thought you were going shopping.

629
00:52:10,066 --> 00:52:12,796
Oops, I forgot.

630
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:18,436
Too much ginger...!

631
00:52:19,976 --> 00:52:38,256
Regret Say...

632
00:52:42,196 --> 00:52:44,026
Is it Mahler...

633
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:50,826
I didn't know she was a classical music fan...

634
00:53:09,756 --> 00:53:20,756
Art is Brief Life is Long They're in full bloom.

635
00:53:25,336 --> 00:53:29,536
I wonder how many more times I'll see the cherry blossoms.

636
00:53:30,456 --> 00:53:32,786
Don't be silly, mother.

637
00:53:32,806 --> 00:53:35,136
You're only 70.

638
00:53:36,016 --> 00:53:38,646
Maybe 30 more...

639
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:53,693
Mom, will you go pay the taxes?

640
00:53:53,793 --> 00:53:55,023
Leave it to me.

641
00:53:57,403 --> 00:53:59,563
You hand it to the clerk, got that?

642
00:53:59,683 --> 00:54:01,208
I know.

643
00:54:01,228 --> 00:54:02,753
Don't treat me like a child.

644
00:54:07,573 --> 00:54:11,603
Oh, dear, what a terrible calamity...

645
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:14,983
I'm really going senile.

646
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:17,453
Nice to see you.

647
00:54:17,553 --> 00:54:19,853
Take care, bye.

648
00:54:24,223 --> 00:54:26,523
I put it in the mail box!

649
00:54:33,143 --> 00:54:35,403
Why, Shige...

650
00:54:35,423 --> 00:54:37,683
Thanks for coming to visit.

651
00:54:37,973 --> 00:54:41,413
Well, I heard you were suddenly hospitalized.

652
00:54:41,613 --> 00:54:44,673
You'll never believe it...

653
00:54:45,043 --> 00:54:46,843
Have a seat.

654
00:54:55,123 --> 00:54:56,153
You see...

655
00:54:56,263 --> 00:54:57,283
Yes.

656
00:54:58,863 --> 00:54:59,923
Look.

657
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:04,063
See the guy visiting that patient over there?

658
00:55:04,503 --> 00:55:07,963
I'm sure they're having an affair.

659
00:55:08,073 --> 00:55:09,433
What!

660
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:14,073
Are you...?

661
00:55:14,343 --> 00:55:19,143
They definitely look suspicious to me!

662
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,713
Suspicious, right?

663
00:55:29,523 --> 00:55:31,253
This is a special room.

664
00:55:31,363 --> 00:55:35,853
That notorious city councilman accused of corruption is in there now.

665
00:55:40,033 --> 00:55:43,993
I occasionally come up here for a breath of fresh air.

666
00:55:51,043 --> 00:55:54,143
These noodles are pretty good, right?

667
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:56,283
They are.

668
00:56:00,793 --> 00:56:05,693
But the coffee's really lousy here.

669
00:56:07,393 --> 00:56:11,633
By the way, why are you in the hospital?

670
00:56:18,643 --> 00:56:20,203
Oh, Shige...!

671
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:39,293
No sign of death's approach In the ciccada's voices - Basho Why, mother.

672
00:56:41,933 --> 00:56:43,293
Turn on the light.

673
00:56:44,203 --> 00:56:47,963
Oh, I hadn't noticed it getting dark.

674
00:56:59,263 --> 00:57:01,003
Noboru!

675
00:57:01,023 --> 00:57:02,763
Turn off your light.

676
00:57:02,883 --> 00:57:04,213
I'm not asleep!

677
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:10,298
Age Comes More Easily Than Wisdom Five problems left.

678
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:14,183
I'm so sleepy.

679
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,423
A hot bath will wake you up.

680
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:36,623
In you go.

681
00:57:44,263 --> 00:57:45,193
Feel better?

682
00:57:45,373 --> 00:57:46,348
Yup!

683
00:57:46,368 --> 00:57:47,343
I'm wide awake.

684
00:57:50,203 --> 00:57:53,863
OK, here goes!

685
00:57:54,533 --> 00:57:57,763
Here goes, here goes...

686
00:57:58,743 --> 00:58:00,363
Here...goes...

687
00:58:10,283 --> 00:58:14,223
You're as limp as a noodle.

688
00:58:15,653 --> 00:58:17,923
Don't give up.

689
00:58:18,103 --> 00:58:20,518
In a fire, the first 5 minutes count.

690
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,953
In a test, it's the last 5 minutes.

691
00:58:30,353 --> 00:58:32,263
Time's up.

692
00:58:32,283 --> 00:58:34,193
Turn in your papers.

693
00:58:38,313 --> 00:58:39,503
Ma'm!

694
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:43,383
Tanaka felt sick and had to go to the nurse's office!

695
00:58:43,823 --> 00:58:44,913
Yes...

696
00:58:45,123 --> 00:58:47,283
We deserve make-up time!

697
00:58:48,293 --> 00:58:49,413
Forget it.

698
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:57,433
Put them in the upstairs closet?

699
00:58:57,533 --> 00:58:58,393
Sure.

700
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:29,393
Noboru's studying like a demon.

701
00:59:30,303 --> 00:59:33,663
But the exams are over.

702
00:59:33,773 --> 00:59:35,533
He did miserably.

703
00:59:47,313 --> 00:59:50,183
About Noboru's tutor.

704
00:59:50,683 --> 00:59:52,173
He really needs one?

705
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:54,553
He's my son, after all.

706
00:59:54,653 --> 00:59:56,053
You've got a point.

707
00:59:59,193 --> 01:00:02,993
But isn't it expensive?

708
01:00:03,403 --> 01:00:07,203
$300 for 2 sessions with a university student.

709
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:08,773
What!

710
01:00:09,603 --> 01:00:11,873
For $300, I'll teach him.

711
01:00:11,973 --> 01:00:14,673
I'll teach him for $200.

712
01:00:16,143 --> 01:00:18,583
Pay me $100 and I'll work harder!

713
01:00:21,753 --> 01:00:25,053
This is getting us nowhere...

714
01:00:30,723 --> 01:00:46,563
Fleeting dreams An octopus making its home in a trap A summer moon - Basho I'm home!

715
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,243
Look, chocolates!

716
01:00:57,433 --> 01:01:00,013
Mommy!

717
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:02,613
Noboru bought chocolates!

718
01:01:02,863 --> 01:01:05,483
They were a Valentine's Day present!

719
01:01:06,733 --> 01:01:10,233
Adolescence Gone!

720
01:01:10,803 --> 01:01:12,393
Gone, gone, gone!

721
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:13,733
I'm home!

722
01:01:14,933 --> 01:01:17,403
Where are those cookies, Nonoko!

723
01:01:17,543 --> 01:01:18,593
I ate them.

724
01:01:18,813 --> 01:01:20,463
What!

725
01:01:20,483 --> 01:01:22,133
I got them for a girl!

726
01:01:22,243 --> 01:01:23,443
But...

727
01:01:23,543 --> 01:01:25,073
No ifs ands or buts!

728
01:01:25,383 --> 01:01:28,243
Mommy already ate half.

729
01:01:28,353 --> 01:01:29,843
Mother...?

730
01:01:40,433 --> 01:01:43,363
Damn...I forgot my umbrella.

731
01:01:43,663 --> 01:01:45,033
Hey, Yamada!

732
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:47,493
Use my umbrella.

733
01:01:47,873 --> 01:01:49,033
How'bout you?

734
01:01:49,133 --> 01:01:50,363
I'll be fine.

735
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:55,373
Say, Tanaka, I forgot my umbrella!

736
01:01:56,193 --> 01:01:57,403
Too bad.

737
01:01:57,423 --> 01:01:58,633
Don't catch cold.

738
01:02:07,453 --> 01:02:08,923
Rejected.

739
01:02:10,663 --> 01:02:11,553
No!

740
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:14,583
Give it back!

741
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:15,753
Not after that.

742
01:02:15,863 --> 01:02:16,993
But it's mine.

743
01:02:17,103 --> 01:02:18,093
Thanks for the favor.

744
01:02:18,203 --> 01:02:19,323
Give it back!

745
01:02:19,933 --> 01:02:21,633
Guess it's a rain date.

746
01:02:26,443 --> 01:02:28,003
Hey, Nakamura.

747
01:02:28,213 --> 01:02:30,043
Back to sock the teacher?

748
01:02:30,323 --> 01:02:32,168
Don't be stupid.

749
01:02:32,188 --> 01:02:34,033
I came to tell him I got into college.

750
01:02:34,613 --> 01:02:36,483
Wow, you made it!

751
01:02:42,493 --> 01:02:43,513
Sir...?

752
01:02:43,623 --> 01:02:44,823
No need to run...

753
01:02:45,193 --> 01:02:46,323
from Nakamura.

754
01:02:46,443 --> 01:02:47,803
Idiot!

755
01:02:47,823 --> 01:02:49,183
Don't believe the rumors.

756
01:02:51,133 --> 01:02:55,433
Hey, Yamada, Yamashita, let's buy some dirty books.

757
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:09,413
Hey!

758
01:03:10,323 --> 01:03:11,153
Shoot!

759
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:14,483
What a coincidence.

760
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:20,548
Tragedy in Bosnia...!

761
01:03:20,568 --> 01:03:22,583
You've got serious taste.

762
01:03:22,693 --> 01:03:25,933
Well, Japan's part of a bigger world.

763
01:03:27,903 --> 01:03:29,833
Can I borrow it later?

764
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:34,373
A real tragedy...

765
01:03:37,683 --> 01:03:38,843
I'm home.

766
01:03:41,413 --> 01:03:45,253
Noboru, the textbook?

767
01:03:45,353 --> 01:03:46,253
This?

768
01:03:46,693 --> 01:03:48,813
I gave you $10 for it.

769
01:03:49,093 --> 01:03:50,453
I want to see it.

770
01:04:08,273 --> 01:04:11,503
'F-1 Racing for Students' What is this!

771
01:04:12,713 --> 01:04:15,443
'Formula-1 Racing for Students'?

772
01:04:15,553 --> 01:04:18,883
It'll help my English and my geography.

773
01:04:20,753 --> 01:04:21,683
You idiot!

774
01:04:22,423 --> 01:04:27,923
You're the one who gave me 'The Power Ranger's ABC' when I was 3!

775
01:04:28,733 --> 01:04:31,993
Noboru, there's a girl on the phone.

776
01:04:32,103 --> 01:04:33,333
What!

777
01:04:40,013 --> 01:04:41,103
Oh, hello...

778
01:04:42,143 --> 01:04:43,573
Oh, yeah, it's me...

779
01:04:54,823 --> 01:04:56,483
Go away!

780
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:02,153
Oh, no, nothing.

781
01:05:03,903 --> 01:05:07,563
Yeah, yeah, OK.

782
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:12,993
A girlfriend...with his looks?

783
01:05:13,113 --> 01:05:14,303
A real girlfriend?

784
01:05:14,413 --> 01:05:15,743
His face is red.

785
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:17,943
Yeah, OK.

786
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:20,143
Bye, then.

787
01:05:32,293 --> 01:05:34,123
It's pounding away!

788
01:05:34,233 --> 01:05:35,423
An irregular heartbeat?

789
01:05:35,533 --> 01:05:36,763
Let's see.

790
01:05:47,973 --> 01:05:49,463
Do you think he's upset?

791
01:05:49,573 --> 01:05:52,373
You insulted him, mother.

792
01:05:52,483 --> 01:05:55,813
This, from the paragon of motherhood?

793
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:56,543
The scent of plums On a mountain path Suddenly dawn - Basho Yamada Family Chronicles I'm home...

794
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:58,303
Welcome back.

795
01:07:00,753 --> 01:07:10,523
An Autumn Night I'm hungry.

796
01:07:12,693 --> 01:07:13,893
Anything to eat?

797
01:07:14,493 --> 01:07:15,653
Coming right up.

798
01:07:23,403 --> 01:07:25,463
Red bean cake or banana.

799
01:07:28,773 --> 01:07:36,183
Who the hell would want to come home to bean cakes after working hard all day!

800
01:07:37,783 --> 01:07:39,343
OK, a banana.

801
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,783
What a jerk!

802
01:07:41,803 --> 01:07:43,683
Who wants a banana!

803
01:09:33,383 --> 01:09:39,648
Turn towards me I'm lonely too The autumn dusk - Basho Mom's down with a cold.

804
01:09:39,668 --> 01:09:45,933
We'll get take-out tonight.

805
01:09:46,043 --> 01:09:46,703
Seaweed-rice special.

806
01:09:46,813 --> 01:09:47,903
Me too!

807
01:09:48,013 --> 01:09:49,243
I'll have the salmon-rice.

808
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:51,573
How'bout you, mother?

809
01:09:51,953 --> 01:09:53,473
The combination special.

810
01:09:55,423 --> 01:09:56,653
I'll go get it!

811
01:09:56,763 --> 01:09:58,423
Not so fast!

812
01:10:02,263 --> 01:10:04,663
Tempura-rice for me!

813
01:10:04,763 --> 01:10:11,703
Going My Way Croquet Tournament That's good.

814
01:10:13,973 --> 01:10:15,963
Hey, hey, lady...

815
01:10:17,643 --> 01:10:19,273
You can't do that!

816
01:10:19,823 --> 01:10:21,038
What?

817
01:10:21,058 --> 01:10:22,273
But this is...

818
01:10:23,163 --> 01:10:25,158
It's empty now, but someone may put a poster up.

819
01:10:25,178 --> 01:10:27,173
There's an election.

820
01:10:27,293 --> 01:10:29,413
But, mister...

821
01:10:32,063 --> 01:10:34,393
This was the only thing underneath.

822
01:10:42,203 --> 01:10:44,903
If it isn't old Saburo...

823
01:10:46,943 --> 01:10:49,373
This is my territory.

824
01:10:49,613 --> 01:10:52,273
Oh, it's you, Shige.

825
01:10:52,543 --> 01:10:55,643
We might as well work together, we're volunteers.

826
01:11:01,053 --> 01:11:03,923
You're on that side, I'm on this.

827
01:11:05,393 --> 01:11:06,983
Don't cross over.

828
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:11,563
Oh, boy, she hasn't changed a bit in 60 years.

829
01:11:14,073 --> 01:11:17,433
Oh, no, I forgot to take out the garbage...

830
01:11:20,513 --> 01:11:22,563
Oh, well, I'll have to sort it!

831
01:11:22,673 --> 01:11:26,203
Why sort burnables?

832
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:32,373
Trash can at the station, Nonoko does the park, Noboru does the store.

833
01:11:33,183 --> 01:11:34,343
You can't do that!

834
01:11:34,463 --> 01:11:35,688
Why not?

835
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:36,933
It's a great plan.

836
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:37,953
Off we go.

837
01:11:38,063 --> 01:11:39,583
See you later.

838
01:11:41,693 --> 01:11:42,493
Ouch!

839
01:11:42,733 --> 01:11:47,133
Here I volunteer cleaning up the park and you dump trash there!

840
01:11:47,233 --> 01:11:50,463
I'm not dumping, just using the public trash cans.

841
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:52,403
That's the problem!

842
01:11:52,503 --> 01:11:54,503
Mom...

843
01:12:09,253 --> 01:12:13,023
The Fight for Justice Excuse us!

844
01:12:16,063 --> 01:12:17,863
Our ball fell in...

845
01:12:22,203 --> 01:12:27,003
This new one or this rubber ball?

846
01:12:29,043 --> 01:12:30,533
The rubber ball!

847
01:12:40,933 --> 01:12:42,613
Honesty's the best policy.

848
01:12:42,633 --> 01:12:44,313
Don't ever lie.

849
01:12:45,093 --> 01:12:46,063
OK.

850
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:48,393
Take this one too.

851
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:50,203
Wow!

852
01:12:50,223 --> 01:12:50,853
Thanks!

853
01:12:58,753 --> 01:13:00,363
Excuse me...

854
01:13:00,383 --> 01:13:01,993
Our ball fell in yesterday...

855
01:13:02,113 --> 01:13:03,473
But you weren't here.

856
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:06,043
Didn't see any.

857
01:13:07,053 --> 01:13:08,343
I see...

858
01:13:09,653 --> 01:13:12,483
I'm sure this was the house.

859
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:22,753
I beg you, please tell those boys to give him his new ball back.

860
01:13:29,373 --> 01:13:31,533
Oh, poor things.

861
01:13:31,643 --> 01:13:35,473
You're right, they're all wilted.

862
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:37,483
Not the flowers!

863
01:13:37,503 --> 01:13:38,903
The accident!

864
01:13:39,143 --> 01:13:40,543
Oh, I see.

865
01:13:41,213 --> 01:13:43,273
It was a motor cycle gang.

866
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:47,483
The poor guard rail.

867
01:13:47,593 --> 01:13:48,643
Mother!

868
01:13:48,753 --> 01:13:52,883
It was the poor child's parents who suffered...

869
01:14:26,763 --> 01:14:29,733
They're so loud, has to be a motorcycle gang.

870
01:14:30,093 --> 01:14:31,653
They're by the park.

871
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:34,963
They're the litterbugs!

872
01:14:35,073 --> 01:14:36,433
I'll go scold them.

873
01:14:36,533 --> 01:14:38,333
That's dangerous, mother!

874
01:14:38,443 --> 01:14:41,133
Someone was recently murdered for that.

875
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:45,733
Senior Citizen Murdered Hmm, I know.

876
01:14:54,493 --> 01:14:56,223
That's worse!

877
01:15:04,443 --> 01:15:05,988
Mm...mother!

878
01:15:06,008 --> 01:15:07,553
Why the get up?

879
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:10,603
Says she's scolding the motorcycle gang.

880
01:15:10,703 --> 01:15:12,933
Won't you stop her, please.

881
01:15:13,523 --> 01:15:16,468
You can't wear that hard-hat.

882
01:15:16,488 --> 01:15:19,433
It's a momento from when we built the house.

883
01:15:19,923 --> 01:15:21,418
Oh.

884
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:22,933
Well that's too bad.

885
01:15:23,153 --> 01:15:26,083
I'm sorry, but you can't.

886
01:15:26,483 --> 01:15:30,153
In that case, you wear it and go.

887
01:15:30,323 --> 01:15:31,813
I go!?

888
01:15:32,633 --> 01:15:34,963
They're not vicious.

889
01:15:34,983 --> 01:15:37,313
They'll go home eventually.

890
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:40,293
Then you have nothing to fear.

891
01:15:40,413 --> 01:15:42,173
Give them a manly scolding.

892
01:15:42,193 --> 01:15:43,953
You're older.

893
01:15:44,503 --> 01:15:45,493
Manly...?

894
01:15:45,603 --> 01:15:47,373
But mother...

895
01:15:47,473 --> 01:15:49,843
I know, let's report them to 911.

896
01:15:49,953 --> 01:15:52,133
The poor kids.

897
01:15:52,153 --> 01:15:54,333
They don't deserve a criminal record for making noise.

898
01:15:54,653 --> 01:15:55,873
A record!

899
01:16:12,733 --> 01:16:14,323
See, they're gone.

900
01:16:15,403 --> 01:16:16,773
You think?

901
01:16:27,013 --> 01:16:28,273
What did I tell you?

902
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,253
We're relying on you.

903
01:16:36,993 --> 01:16:39,223
All right, I'll just go look.

904
01:16:41,693 --> 01:16:44,093
Be careful, dear!

905
01:17:32,183 --> 01:17:34,273
Um, excuse me...

906
01:17:34,713 --> 01:17:36,113
What do you want?

907
01:17:36,213 --> 01:17:38,983
It's awfully late.

908
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:39,978
Yeah?

909
01:17:39,998 --> 01:17:40,643
So what?

910
01:17:43,923 --> 01:17:45,553
Got a problem?

911
01:17:45,673 --> 01:17:47,533
N, no, we can work this out.

912
01:17:47,553 --> 01:17:49,413
I don't have a problem...

913
01:17:49,763 --> 01:17:54,823
I don't have a problem, but I do have a request.

914
01:17:55,073 --> 01:17:56,063
Spit it out.

915
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:59,673
Ask away, old man.

916
01:18:00,573 --> 01:18:03,303
Would you mind turning off your headlight.

917
01:18:03,543 --> 01:18:06,313
So that's your request, then?

918
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:08,283
Um, n, no.

919
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,373
Whaddya want then?

920
01:18:15,353 --> 01:18:22,193
Come, come fireflies, this water's bitter, this water's sweet What is that!

921
01:18:33,973 --> 01:18:35,403
That old bag's nuts.

922
01:18:36,013 --> 01:18:37,703
Mother, are you all right!?

923
01:18:41,453 --> 01:18:43,043
An old bag, huh?

924
01:18:43,293 --> 01:18:45,338
At least turn down that putt-putt.

925
01:18:45,358 --> 01:18:47,403
You're a neighborhood nuisance.

926
01:18:47,623 --> 01:18:49,983
M, mother, you can't talk to these low-lifes.

927
01:18:50,093 --> 01:18:51,853
Who you calling low-life!

928
01:18:51,963 --> 01:18:54,453
How exciting!

929
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:57,193
What a great voice, you have.

930
01:18:57,303 --> 01:18:58,733
Mother!

931
01:18:58,903 --> 01:19:02,563
And a fine face and physique to go with it.

932
01:19:02,673 --> 01:19:05,833
I bet people shut up when you talk.

933
01:19:06,173 --> 01:19:07,233
Get to the point!

934
01:19:07,883 --> 01:19:09,963
Really scary.

935
01:19:09,983 --> 01:19:12,063
You sure shut this guy up in a hurry.

936
01:19:12,183 --> 01:19:13,073
A cinch.

937
01:19:13,183 --> 01:19:18,513
When you yell at people, it reminds me of a snake staring down a frog.

938
01:19:20,493 --> 01:19:26,323
It sure must be fun shutting people up and ordering them around.

939
01:19:26,523 --> 01:19:27,253
It's OK.

940
01:19:27,363 --> 01:19:33,023
I know, why don't you employ your venom in the cause of justice?

941
01:19:33,533 --> 01:19:34,523
What?

942
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:38,773
Don't you like fighting for justice, that Masked Rider stuff?

943
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,013
Way old, granny.

944
01:19:42,123 --> 01:19:46,103
Of course, it's not exactly cool, is it?

945
01:19:46,123 --> 01:19:50,103
Nowadays, we turn a blind eye to every kind of misdeed.

946
01:19:50,223 --> 01:19:52,158
But I know you could do it.

947
01:19:52,178 --> 01:19:54,113
Because you're fearless.

948
01:19:55,923 --> 01:20:03,653
Someone tosses a cigarette butt or can from their car, you use that voice of yours, make'em pick it up.

949
01:20:04,763 --> 01:20:11,203
You see a kid causing trouble on the subway, you gently tap him on the shoulder.

950
01:20:11,803 --> 01:20:15,333
I'm sure anyone will do whatever you say.

951
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:20,433
We'll all be so happy, we'll cheer you on.

952
01:20:23,353 --> 01:20:27,343
It's nice to be appreciated.

953
01:20:27,753 --> 01:20:34,263
While you're at it, scare off thugs, and take the bad guys' money.

954
01:20:35,733 --> 01:20:40,563
What do you say, will you heed an old bag's plea and fight for justice?

955
01:20:40,733 --> 01:20:45,433
It'll be a whole lot better than listening to me rant and rave.

956
01:20:47,643 --> 01:20:50,163
I think this old lady's nuts.

957
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:52,873
No go?

958
01:20:53,113 --> 01:20:57,843
What a shame, with your godly attributes.

959
01:21:00,953 --> 01:21:01,943
Outta here!

960
01:21:09,593 --> 01:21:12,093
Think about fighting for justice!

961
01:21:17,843 --> 01:21:19,203
Hey, you forgot this.

962
01:21:31,323 --> 01:21:32,653
Did he get it?

963
01:21:32,753 --> 01:21:34,553
Mother!

964
01:21:48,283 --> 01:21:50,043
Noboru!

965
01:21:50,063 --> 01:21:51,823
Nonoko!

966
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,833
Mother!

967
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:50,733
It's the Masked Rider!

968
01:23:30,873 --> 01:23:32,963
The Masked Rider!

969
01:24:16,713 --> 01:24:18,883
Help...

970
01:24:28,693 --> 01:24:30,063
Mother!

971
01:24:30,693 --> 01:24:32,093
Noboru!

972
01:24:33,703 --> 01:24:35,463
Nonoko...

973
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:51,883
Thank you, Masked Rider!

974
01:25:39,933 --> 01:25:54,543
How cruel A grasshopper trapped Under a warrior's helmet - Basho I'm home.

975
01:25:54,753 --> 01:25:56,983
Did you bring your umbrella home?

976
01:25:57,893 --> 01:26:01,563
Your husband's home from work, exhausted, and all you can ask is'did you bring your umbrella home!' OK, OK.

977
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:05,253
Welcome home.

978
01:26:05,273 --> 01:26:08,943
Have a hard day?

979
01:26:09,533 --> 01:26:10,993
Where's your umbrella?

980
01:26:11,903 --> 01:26:13,263
I forgot it.

981
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:20,203
Welcome home.

982
01:26:20,303 --> 01:26:25,143
Look, I remembered to bring it home, so there, ha!

983
01:26:29,263 --> 01:26:30,728
What?

984
01:26:30,748 --> 01:26:32,213
Got a problem?

985
01:26:33,423 --> 01:26:37,153
But you didn't take an umbrella today.

986
01:26:39,263 --> 01:26:40,153
See?

987
01:26:41,293 --> 01:26:44,893
Section Chief Yamada I bought a cake.

988
01:26:45,003 --> 01:26:45,983
Really?

989
01:26:47,463 --> 01:26:49,903
Once in a blue moon...

990
01:26:50,703 --> 01:26:53,173
Guilty conscience?

991
01:26:53,273 --> 01:26:54,003
What was that!

992
01:26:54,113 --> 01:26:56,178
That's going too far.

993
01:26:56,198 --> 01:26:58,263
Here Takashi's thoughtfully gone and...

994
01:26:58,383 --> 01:26:59,973
I even bought custard.

995
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:04,013
Now that's suspicious.

996
01:27:07,763 --> 01:27:09,556
Nonoko!

997
01:27:09,576 --> 01:27:11,369
Noboru!

998
01:27:11,389 --> 01:27:13,182
Your father got cake!

999
01:27:20,163 --> 01:27:21,393
Where's Dad?

1000
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:23,503
On a business trip.

1001
01:27:24,173 --> 01:27:25,603
But his briefcase...

1002
01:27:27,003 --> 01:27:29,973
Oh no, he must've forgotten it.

1003
01:27:30,113 --> 01:27:31,803
And his scarf and train pass.

1004
01:27:33,493 --> 01:27:34,018
What?

1005
01:27:34,038 --> 01:27:34,563
Oh, no!

1006
01:27:35,113 --> 01:27:38,083
He was supposed to leave early.

1007
01:27:38,183 --> 01:27:39,623
Father!

1008
01:27:41,093 --> 01:27:42,383
Dear!

1009
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:51,623
Section Chief Yamada Mom must've overslept.

1010
01:27:52,933 --> 01:27:56,923
She woke up late and thought Dad had already left.

1011
01:27:57,073 --> 01:27:58,593
Oh, I see.

1012
01:28:06,283 --> 01:28:08,513
B...b...briefcase!

1013
01:28:08,953 --> 01:28:10,573
H...h...here!

1014
01:28:11,283 --> 01:28:12,213
I'm off!

1015
01:28:12,483 --> 01:28:14,453
Have a nice trip!

1016
01:28:18,423 --> 01:28:20,453
Be careful!

1017
01:28:24,503 --> 01:28:25,963
I can still make it.

1018
01:28:53,893 --> 01:28:55,453
Are you OK?

1019
01:29:07,773 --> 01:29:08,933
Phone, phone...

1020
01:29:19,923 --> 01:29:22,283
I suddenly feel terrible...

1021
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:28,123
I can hardly breathe...

1022
01:29:28,433 --> 01:29:31,423
Yes, yes, I'll get there.

1023
01:29:32,203 --> 01:29:34,363
I'll crawl there if I have to...

1024
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:36,533
Please tell the client...

1025
01:29:36,733 --> 01:29:40,403
Yes, yes, I'm terribly sorry...

1026
01:29:45,243 --> 01:29:46,803
A slight fever.

1027
01:29:47,853 --> 01:29:49,143
You should stay home.

1028
01:29:50,383 --> 01:29:52,413
Before it gets worse.

1029
01:29:52,523 --> 01:29:55,313
The company won't take care o you.

1030
01:29:57,403 --> 01:29:59,113
You know, maybe I will.

1031
01:29:59,133 --> 01:30:00,843
Make a long weekend of it.

1032
01:30:00,963 --> 01:30:03,153
You should, you should.

1033
01:30:03,263 --> 01:30:06,793
It's good to relax and enjoy some time at home.

1034
01:30:23,113 --> 01:30:24,983
...What is it?

1035
01:30:27,323 --> 01:30:31,013
I started feeling better, the minute I decided to stay home.

1036
01:30:31,523 --> 01:30:34,083
I guess I'll go in after all.

1037
01:30:48,173 --> 01:30:49,833
Take care, dear.

1038
01:31:57,583 --> 01:31:59,313
Next, Mr.

1039
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:01,063
Yamada will offer his congratulations.

1040
01:32:01,653 --> 01:32:04,113
Your notes, dear.

1041
01:32:10,423 --> 01:32:12,583
He's wound tight as a spring!

1042
01:32:20,313 --> 01:32:22,908
Um...

1043
01:32:22,928 --> 01:32:25,523
This is a fine, auspicious day...

1044
01:32:29,973 --> 01:32:49,293
Cucumber, garbage bags, light bulbs Life is full of surprises...

1045
01:32:55,173 --> 01:32:57,863
Now...that is, up until now...

1046
01:32:58,603 --> 01:33:01,403
things seemed to be just fine...

1047
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:05,903
then suddenly, you're shoved off a cliff!

1048
01:33:06,083 --> 01:33:12,413
By...your trusted spouse, of all people!

1049
01:33:13,483 --> 01:33:14,923
He means you.

1050
01:33:16,793 --> 01:33:20,123
But Ichiro and Kazuko...

1051
01:33:20,493 --> 01:33:24,823
You have to accept life as it comes.

1052
01:33:27,463 --> 01:33:36,703
Acceptance is the key to surviving the worst situations, without losing heart or breaking up.

1053
01:33:37,113 --> 01:33:38,973
Breaking up?!

1054
01:33:41,043 --> 01:33:43,073
Even the worst behavior...

1055
01:33:43,613 --> 01:33:48,573
can be accepted and forgiven if there is no malice.

1056
01:33:48,693 --> 01:33:51,713
In fact, must be forgiven so one can go on with life!

1057
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:54,213
Gutsy speech!

1058
01:33:54,663 --> 01:33:59,963
It's not necessarily bad to resign yourself to a situation.

1059
01:34:00,163 --> 01:34:02,463
In fact, it's essential.

1060
01:34:02,803 --> 01:34:05,563
A must for a happy family.

1061
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:08,873
A must for facing life and getting on with it.

1062
01:34:10,643 --> 01:34:22,883
Though it may sound negative, 'acceptance' is the only way out of totally unacceptable situations.

1063
01:34:25,873 --> 01:34:28,068
I didn't know he had it in him...

1064
01:34:28,088 --> 01:34:30,283
What a man.

1065
01:34:38,303 --> 01:34:41,963
Um, well, that is, I mean.

1066
01:34:46,043 --> 01:34:52,473
So, my dear Ichiro and Kazuko, congratulations on your wedding.

1067
01:34:54,023 --> 01:34:59,983
May you be a tough, harmonious couple.

1068
01:35:10,703 --> 01:35:18,673
When I grew up and fell in love I asked my sweetheart, what lies ahead?

1069
01:35:20,023 --> 01:35:32,683
Will we have rainbows day after day?

1070
01:35:32,703 --> 01:35:45,363
Here's what my sweetheart said Que sera sera, whatever will be, will be the future's not ours to see qu
