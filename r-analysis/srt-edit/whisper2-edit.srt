00:00:07,059 --> 00:01:05,222
Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television, Hakuhodo & Studio Ghibli present WHISPER OF THE HEART Shizuku Yoko Honna Seiji Issei Takahashi Shizuku's Father Takashi Tachibana Shizuku's Mother Shigeru Muroi Baron Shigeru Tsuyuguchi 'World Emporium' Proprietor Keiju Kobayashi - Hello.

2
00:01:05,242 --> 00:02:03,405
- Hot, isn't it.

3
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,461
I'm home.

4
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,591
Thanks.

5
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,178
You don't need a bag for just milk!

6
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,846
They put it in one.

7
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:20,588
Just say 'no'!

8
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,005
Pour me some, too.

9
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,352
Dad, want some barley tea?

10
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,438
Please...I'll come there.

11
00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:29,750
- Thanks.

12
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,945
The word processor open?

13
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:32,140
- I'm still printing.

14
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,696
I should buy an electronic notebook.

15
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,699
You smoke too much.

16
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,327
You could've gone to your aunt's, too.

17
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:43,173
No.

18
00:02:43,193 --> 00:02:44,361
Shiho wears me out.

19
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,166
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.

20
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,709
Do you need lunch?

21
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,503
No, I'll eat out.

22
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,548
The library's busy going to a bar-code system.

23
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,010
I like the book-cards better.

24
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,221
Me, too.

25
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,723
Hey, this isn't right...

26
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,225
What?

27
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,728
Did you leave out a line?

28
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,398
You're right!

29
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:12,328
Let me go first.

30
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:13,975
I have to get this right or my prof will complain.

31
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:19,573
Seiji Amasawa This guy...

32
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,619
You can read, but don't stay up too late.

33
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,704
Good night.

34
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,590
I thought I'd seen that name before...

35
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,553
Here, too...

36
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:52,064
Seiji Amasawa He's taken all these books out before me.

37
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,274
Seiji Amasawa...what's he like?

38
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:04,985
Wonder if he's nice.

39
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:19,269
Seiji Amasawa Shizuku!

40
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:26,046
Get up!

41
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,808
I'm leaving!

42
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:31,678
Did you sleep in your clothes?

43
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:33,471
Put the rice on.

44
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,150
'Bye!

45
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:40,770
Oh, no!

46
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,229
I've got to meet Yuko!

47
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,243
My purse...

48
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,663
You ran back upstairs again?

49
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,790
Yeah.

50
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,626
That's funny...

51
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,711
Try by the phone...

52
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,379
Yes!

53
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,006
...where you left it.

54
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:00,394
I'm late!

55
00:05:00,414 --> 00:05:01,666
Lock the door!

56
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,344
Clumsy!

57
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,355
It's flying so low!

58
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,861
Today's a lucky day!

59
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,055
Is it ever hot!

60
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,691
How's it going?

61
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,880
Hit it!

62
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,799
Hi, Shizuku!

63
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:25,834
Hi!

64
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:27,544
Keep it up!

65
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,766
Miss Kosaka?

66
00:06:33,403 --> 00:06:34,571
Tsukishima?

67
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:35,759
What are you doing here?

68
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,272
Could I ask a favor?

69
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,774
Nothing weird, I hope...

70
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,443
Let me in the library!

71
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,736
What?

72
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,113
Can't you wait till school starts?

73
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,909
I've read all my books, and the public library's closed.

74
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,079
I'm reading 20 before school starts.

75
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:56,238
20?

76
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:58,281
You've got high-school entrance exams, don't forget.

77
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,044
Hurry it up!

78
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,046
Here it is!

79
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,297
Bring it here.

80
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,469
Give me your card and the book card.

81
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,554
Yes, ma'am.

82
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,225
No one's ever borrowed this book!

83
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:17,885
It's rare.

84
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,803
They don't even have it at the public library.

85
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:30,824
Donated Amasawa's Collection 'Amasawa' ...Miss!

86
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,661
Do you know who this 'Amasawa' is?

87
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,830
Look what you made me do!

88
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,677
Someone gave it to us.

89
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:40,324
I wouldn't know him.

90
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,169
Ask an older teacher.

91
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,629
Shizuku!

92
00:07:43,974 --> 00:07:46,476
What are you doing here?

93
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:48,998
I've been at the front gate since 11!

94
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,846
If I have to stand in the sun I get more freckles!

95
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:53,847
Sorry!

96
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:55,736
Relax, Harada.

97
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:57,508
You take freckles much too seriously.

98
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,521
They're a serious problem, Miss!

99
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:04,525
Yeah, yeah...alright, out of here, both of you.

100
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:10,584
Move up!

101
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:11,355
Move up!

102
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:16,048
I tried, but it's not going to work.

103
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:18,530
Why not just sing it in English?

104
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,544
'White clouds spreading up over a hill...

105
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:32,469
'...a road winds up to the town.' 'An old house with small windows...

106
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,724
'An old dog waits for me to come home...

107
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,228
'Country road leading far away...

108
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:45,899
'The road to my old home town...

109
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:50,320
'West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain...

110
00:08:50,457 --> 00:08:53,814
'My good old home town.' - That's not bad.

111
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:57,191
- Yes, it is.

112
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,204
It's trite.

113
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,415
Yeah?

114
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,168
I wrote another one.

115
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:09,923
'Concrete roads, everywhere...

116
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:14,928
'Cut down all the trees, filled in the valleys...

117
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,514
'Western Tokyo...

118
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,725
'Tama Mountain...

119
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:27,274
'My home town is concrete roads.' What is this?!

120
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,235
But what's this 'problem'?

121
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,946
You don't need the lyrics yet...

122
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,450
No...are you in love with anyone?

123
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,701
What?

124
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,872
Studying for entrance exams would be easier having someone.

125
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,957
We could encourage each other.

126
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:45,741
Yuko!

127
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:46,950
You're in love!

128
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,256
You got a love letter?!

129
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,132
Shh!

130
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,985
When?

131
00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:53,680
Who?

132
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,375
Is he handsome?

133
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:56,148
He's in another class.

134
00:09:56,168 --> 00:09:57,795
He's not bad.

135
00:09:57,941 --> 00:09:59,526
Meet him, then!

136
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:01,131
If you don't like him, just say no!

137
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,684
Yeah, but...

138
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,688
So there's someone else you like!

139
00:10:08,618 --> 00:10:10,453
You can't hide it from me!

140
00:10:10,473 --> 00:10:12,308
Confess!

141
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,739
It's Su...Su...

142
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,574
Tsukishima!

143
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,160
Bring me my bag, will you?

144
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,620
Sugimura!

145
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,665
That blue sports bag.

146
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,667
Come on, Tsukishima!

147
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,211
Throw it over here.

148
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,090
Shut up and go back to the bench!

149
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,885
I'm first-string, and we're through to the regionals!

150
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,137
Yuko?

151
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,360
You're in love with Sugimura?

152
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:55,520
What am I going to do?

153
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,522
The way I reacted, he might know!

154
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:58,919
Don't worry.

155
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:00,149
He's too dense.

156
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,704
What about the guy who wrote you?

157
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,877
I'll think about it a while.

158
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,503
I see.

159
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,549
At least your parents aren't always after you to study.

160
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,177
Silence isn't always great.

161
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,053
I wonder...

162
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:21,859
- Oh, no!

163
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,547
- What?

164
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:23,944
I forgot my book!

165
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:25,049
I'll go back.

166
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,143
I'll ride you.

167
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,656
No.

168
00:11:27,676 --> 00:11:29,053
You'll be late for cram school.

169
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,981
I'll call you.

170
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,939
That book...

171
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,234
Oh, is it yours?

172
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,115
Here, 'Shizuku Tsukishima'.

173
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,117
How do you know my name?

174
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,912
Guess!

175
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,624
My library card...

176
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,544
I'd forget about 'Concrete Road', though.

177
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,427
You read it!

178
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:43,905
Jerk!

179
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:44,516
Jerk!

180
00:12:44,536 --> 00:12:45,127
Jerk!

181
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:47,701
Jerk!

182
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:48,354
Jerk!

183
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:49,007
Jerk!

184
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,648
Jerk!

185
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:09,746
'I'd forget about "Concrete Road"...' Get lost!

186
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,037
I'm home.

187
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:53,260
Shiho?

188
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,198
You're back already?

189
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,543
I'm beat!

190
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,714
I got a ride with someone who was coming this way.

191
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,467
Where's Mom?

192
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:05,063
Summer Intensive Seminar.

193
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,543
Dad's at work.

194
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,723
You could clean up a little...

195
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,641
What about dinner?

196
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,226
I'm going to wash the rice.

197
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:14,865
Shizuku!

198
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:16,387
The breakfast things are still out!

199
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,899
I'm getting to it!

200
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:23,019
Mom's busy!

201
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,479
We've got to help!

202
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:32,236
Do the rice and put away the washing.

203
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:34,238
I'll take a shower and make dinner.

204
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,586
Aunt says come see her when you get into high school.

205
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,506
Are you studying?

206
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,469
Don't think you can take it easy just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.

207
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,596
I know!

208
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,767
She even wanted me to bring home soy sauce!

209
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,936
That's your aunt, all right.

210
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,272
It was the same thing last year.

211
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,598
Yes!

212
00:15:00,618 --> 00:15:01,766
It was miso!

213
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:02,934
Boy, was it heavy!

214
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,112
Two kilos of it!

215
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:21,515
Shizuku!

216
00:15:21,535 --> 00:15:23,621
Get up and vacuum by your desk!

217
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,966
I'm washing the sheets.

218
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,968
And airing the bedding.

219
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,637
Where's Mom?

220
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,972
Long gone.

221
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,479
Put that stuff away and take Dad his lunch.

222
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,647
Me?!

223
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:42,452
Why not?

224
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:44,141
You're going to the library.

225
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,571
Shall I go instead?

226
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:52,284
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath and the balcony and go to the Co-op?

227
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,997
Don't forget to turn the bedding and fix dinner.

228
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,169
I'm going!

229
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,010
Shizuku!

230
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,679
Mail these, will you?

231
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,055
What?

232
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,349
M-A-I-L!

233
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,024
You don't have to read them!

234
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,359
Take the paper-clip off.

235
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,861
Your boyfriend?

236
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,112
Idiot!

237
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,921
Hey cat...are you alone?

238
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,927
Where are you going?

239
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,057
What's out there?

240
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:42,196
Hey!

241
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:43,259
Answer me!

242
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:57,170
I get off here.

243
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,233
What about you?

244
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,040
See you.

245
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:18,107
Hey!

246
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:18,878
A cat!

247
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,660
The library's that way!

248
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:08,772
And it felt just like the start of a story...

249
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,142
There he is!

250
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:27,487
No Entrance What a hill!

251
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:43,899
How far up is he going?

252
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,262
Cat?

253
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,056
Cat?

254
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,897
Does he live around here?

255
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,171
Hey, cat!

256
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:48,422
Where are you going?

257
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:49,673
Do you live around here?

258
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:13,331
I never knew there was a place like this way up here...

259
00:22:32,611 --> 00:22:34,321
That's not nice!

260
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:36,051
Going around teasing dogs!

261
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,578
Maybe you're teasing me, too.

262
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:47,467
I never guessed there was a store like this up here either...

263
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,289
Cool!

264
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,508
Are you that cat?

265
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,813
Oh, hello...

266
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:42,981
Um...

267
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:45,036
That's all right.

268
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,975
Look around all you want.

269
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,362
The Baron gets bored.

270
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,449
Is this doll 'the Baron'?

271
00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:55,219
Yep.

272
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:56,873
Baron Humbert von Jechingen.

273
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:58,527
Quite the name...

274
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,340
Sorry.

275
00:25:09,935 --> 00:25:10,790
Thanks.

276
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,665
I'm fine now.

277
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,302
That's a great clock.

278
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,140
It was sitting in some castle, all rusted out.

279
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,349
Look...

280
00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:23,470
It's beautiful.

281
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,221
What is it?

282
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,570
Wait and see.

283
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,029
What great dwarfs!

284
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:18,576
So you're a young lady who knows about dwarfs, are you?

285
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,540
Watch the face...if it works.

286
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,643
A fairy!

287
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:45,156
The light shines on the glass.

288
00:26:45,176 --> 00:26:46,553
Come up here.

289
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,069
A princess?

290
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,445
That's right.

291
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,415
Are they in love?

292
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:09,096
But they live in different worlds.

293
00:27:09,116 --> 00:27:11,285
He's the king of the dwarfs.

294
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:16,926
Only while the clock is striking 12 is she changed back from a sheep.

295
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:20,805
But he appears every hour...

296
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,598
...and waits for her.

297
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:28,771
The artisan who made this must have been disappointed in love.

298
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,151
That's why they both look so sad...

299
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,531
This clock's fast, isn't it...

300
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,284
Only about five minutes, though.

301
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,660
Oh, no!

302
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,289
I've got to be at the library!

303
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,041
Can I come back sometime?

304
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:53,004
Sure...but go left to get to the library!

305
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,726
I'm right above it!

306
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:13,953
What a find!

307
00:28:13,973 --> 00:28:15,600
A place where stories start!

308
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,030
Fantastic!

309
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,991
Tsukishima!

310
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,826
Shizuku Tsukishima!

311
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,247
Isn't this yours?

312
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,713
Forgetful, aren't you.

313
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,673
Thanks...but how...?

314
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,550
Guess!

315
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,420
The cat!

316
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,880
Is that your cat?

317
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,558
You sure eat a big lunch!

318
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,686
No!

319
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,482
'Concrete roads, everywhere' ...

320
00:28:55,619 --> 00:28:56,746
It's not mine!

321
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:57,893
Hey!

322
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,781
Oh, here you are...

323
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,286
What's wrong with you?

324
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,705
It's hard to explain.

325
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,460
I felt like I'd found a treasure hidden in a cave.

326
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,296
Then what someone said buried me alive.

327
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,423
Sounds complicated.

328
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,302
Getting more books?

329
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,930
Seven more to go.

330
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:27,255
Still at it?

331
00:29:27,275 --> 00:29:28,464
What about lunch?

332
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,600
I'll buy something.

333
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:30,988
You will?

334
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,260
Thanks, then.

335
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,960
June 16th...

336
00:29:56,722 --> 00:29:58,390
Wow!

337
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,078
Amasawa's read this one, too!

338
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,301
What's he like?

339
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:07,524
No!

340
00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:08,462
He's not you!

341
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,268
Shizuku!

342
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:04,477
Hurry!

343
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,239
I'm late!

344
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,867
Pass my umbrella.

345
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,706
Rain every day this term!

346
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:20,086
At least you're studying because you want to.

347
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:21,379
Sorry.

348
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,214
Study hard!

349
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,840
Don't you worry!

350
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,599
Shizuku!

351
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,600
Hi!

352
00:31:34,778 --> 00:31:35,550
Hurry!

353
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,342
We'll be late!

354
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,897
I hate all these tests!

355
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,024
One every day!

356
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,572
Did you answer?

357
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,740
No.

358
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,242
Did he say anything?

359
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,953
I'm going to say no.

360
00:31:54,297 --> 00:31:55,820
Yeah?

361
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,363
Maybe that's best.

362
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,958
Sugimura!

363
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,710
Better hurry!

364
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,255
I know!

365
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:14,756
Time's up.

366
00:32:14,776 --> 00:32:15,965
Gather the papers.

367
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,941
See you this afternoon.

368
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,905
Let's go see Miss Kosaka.

369
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,782
Let me go to the teachers' room first.

370
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,908
Sure.

371
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:34,255
- Tsukishima!

372
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:35,277
- What?

373
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,580
I lucked out on the test!

374
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:38,998
Isn't that nice.

375
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,001
Everything I studied was on it!

376
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,628
So you're not just a baseball goof...

377
00:32:44,764 --> 00:32:46,871
Yuko's good at guessing, too.

378
00:32:46,891 --> 00:32:48,998
Why not study with her?

379
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,301
With Harada?

380
00:32:50,437 --> 00:32:51,459
- Hey, Sugimura!

381
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:52,501
- What?

382
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,972
Come on!

383
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,480
Stop fixing me up!

384
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:03,647
Was it obvious?

385
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,774
I never just guess!

386
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,067
Sorry!

387
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,945
Excuse me...

388
00:33:13,502 --> 00:33:15,170
A library-book donor?

389
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,858
Gee, I don't know...

390
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:18,945
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.

391
00:33:18,965 --> 00:33:20,863
There's this stamp in it.

392
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,667
Oh...

393
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,547
That's Dr Amasawa.

394
00:33:28,683 --> 00:33:29,768
I've read it.

395
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:30,873
It's a good book!

396
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,343
Yes, very.

397
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:35,387
What kind of person is he?

398
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:39,725
He was chairman of the PTA a few years ago.

399
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:41,676
The PTA?

400
00:33:41,696 --> 00:33:43,511
Would you know his given name?

401
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,314
His given name?

402
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,860
Mr Kimura, do you remember that Dr Amasawa's given name?

403
00:33:49,996 --> 00:33:51,686
Dr Amasawa?

404
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:53,396
It was 'Koichi'.

405
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,407
Koichi Amasawa...

406
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:58,401
His youngest son's in your year, Tsukishima.

407
00:33:58,421 --> 00:34:01,070
You don't know him?

408
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,415
He is?!

409
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,084
Thank you very much!

410
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,836
Excuse us!

411
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,256
Sorry!

412
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,927
Shizuku, where are you going?

413
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,430
What a surprise!

414
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,391
Tell me about it!

415
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,435
What's with you?!

416
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,604
Sorry!

417
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:37,408
Hey, where are you going?

418
00:34:53,977 --> 00:34:55,041
He ignored me!

419
00:34:55,061 --> 00:34:56,125
Of all the nerve!

420
00:34:56,271 --> 00:34:57,648
Who is he?

421
00:34:57,668 --> 00:34:59,045
Where are you going?

422
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,525
He's a jerk!

423
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:01,880
He won't make me avoid him!

424
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,480
I've been carrying her lunch all over!

425
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:12,151
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?!

426
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:16,655
Looks like springtime has come for Shizuku at last!

427
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,657
It isn't true!

428
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,827
You met a prince from one of your books?

429
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:22,995
Is he handsome?

430
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,664
I just want to find out what he's like!

431
00:35:25,842 --> 00:35:27,928
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.

432
00:35:27,948 --> 00:35:30,034
Tell us!

433
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,837
Yuko!

434
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,672
It happened too fast.

435
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,760
'Ma', something, 'Masaki', maybe...

436
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,053
Hmm?

437
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,387
Hmm...

438
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:45,559
But it's like Tsukishima to run out without hearing the end of something.

439
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,354
You want to know, but you don't...

440
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:52,358
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!

441
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,861
How terribly romantic!

442
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:01,700
Should you really tease a girl who has just written your lyric?

443
00:36:01,878 --> 00:36:02,942
- You finished?!

444
00:36:02,962 --> 00:36:04,026
- Let's see!

445
00:36:06,049 --> 00:36:07,475
O Shizuku!

446
00:36:07,495 --> 00:36:08,921
O great poet!

447
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:10,367
We will not transgress again!

448
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,711
All right, then.

449
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,381
I'm not sure...

450
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:22,221
I don't know about old home towns, so I wrote about what I feel.

451
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,556
This is great!

452
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:29,895
'Country road, this old road...

453
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:35,067
'If I go right to the end...

454
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:40,239
'Got a feeling it'll take me...

455
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:44,254
'...to that town, country road.' This is good, Shizuku.

456
00:36:44,274 --> 00:36:48,111
I like it.

457
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,998
It's not hard to sing?

458
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,250
We'll manage.

459
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:55,713
We can give this to the juniors and sing it at the teachers' thank-you!

460
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,089
There, too?!

461
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,006
Slow down!

462
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,591
I like this part.

463
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,929
'I left because I was alone and I had nothing...

464
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:10,436
'Pushed away my sadness and pretended I was strong...' Ladies, the bell.

465
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:20,279
The sun's come out!

466
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,905
Shizuku!

467
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:24,107
Come to the choir room!

468
00:37:24,127 --> 00:37:25,942
We'll show them your lyrics.

469
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,454
No, I'm going to the library.

470
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,914
There's another test tomorrow...

471
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,458
I'll study there.

472
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,709
Bookworm!

473
00:37:34,419 --> 00:38:13,499
'Bye Harada...

474
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:19,004
Can I talk to you for a minute?

475
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,016
It's closed.

476
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,686
Have these flowers been watered?

477
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:50,452
Baron's gone...maybe someone bought him.

478
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:00,045
World Emporium; Shiro Nishi, Prop.

479
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:04,383
'Shiro Nishi' ...maybe that jerk's name is 'Nishi', too.

480
00:39:18,074 --> 00:39:19,471
Shizuku!

481
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:20,888
Shizuku!

482
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,906
Yuko's on the phone!

483
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,701
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.

484
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,411
Yuko?

485
00:39:32,964 --> 00:39:34,174
What?

486
00:39:34,194 --> 00:39:35,404
I can't hear you.

487
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,917
I'll be there in a minute.

488
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:40,961
'Bye.

489
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:42,911
- Where are you going?

490
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:43,911
- Not far.

491
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,598
What's wrong?

492
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:54,766
Shizuku!

493
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,603
What's the matter?

494
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,771
What am I going to do?!

495
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:05,611
The guy who wrote the letter got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!

496
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:10,115
Uh-oh...

497
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,619
Why you, of all people?!

498
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,663
Hey!

499
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,377
That guy is so dense!

500
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:26,965
But he doesn't know how you feel about him...

501
00:40:28,978 --> 00:40:32,461
I'll apologize to him.

502
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:35,964
But I can't go to school tomorrow looking like this.

503
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,476
And miss the test?

504
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:38,977
Yeah.

505
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,979
Oh.

506
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,583
Idiot!

507
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,504
What?

508
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:08,924
It was easy.

509
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,009
The library again, Shizuku?

510
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,177
I'm going to Yuko's.

511
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,346
Say hello.

512
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,690
Tsukishima!

513
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,192
Wait up!

514
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,867
About Harada...

515
00:41:43,052 --> 00:41:45,784
...then she started crying.

516
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:48,536
Did I say something wrong?

517
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:54,886
She said, ' Why you, of all people, ' didn't she?

518
00:41:55,231 --> 00:41:56,796
Yeah.

519
00:41:56,816 --> 00:41:58,381
A guy on the baseball team asked me.

520
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:00,225
No!

521
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:03,395
She didn't want to hear something like that from you!

522
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,188
Don't you understand?!

523
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:06,898
No, I don't!

524
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,567
Tell me!

525
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,561
You really are dense, you know!

526
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:14,022
She likes you!

527
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:15,606
What?!

528
00:42:15,626 --> 00:42:16,815
No way!

529
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:18,024
I don't need this!

530
00:42:18,421 --> 00:42:20,111
You don't?

531
00:42:20,131 --> 00:42:21,821
How do you think Yuko feels?!

532
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:23,531
She stayed home sick today!

533
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,544
But...I like you!

534
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:28,754
What?!

535
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,257
Don't make jokes at a time like this!

536
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,550
It's not a joke!

537
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,761
I've liked you for a long time!

538
00:42:36,773 --> 00:42:38,254
Not me!

539
00:42:38,274 --> 00:42:39,755
You can't!

540
00:42:39,984 --> 00:42:41,527
You don't like me?

541
00:42:41,547 --> 00:42:43,090
Or do you have a boyfriend?

542
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,687
I don't have a boyfriend...

543
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:47,939
But...

544
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:49,274
I'm sorry!

545
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:50,275
Wait!

546
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,778
Tell me the truth!

547
00:42:53,122 --> 00:42:56,104
But we've always been friends...

548
00:42:56,124 --> 00:42:59,106
I like you, but not...

549
00:43:02,298 --> 00:43:03,466
I'm sorry.

550
00:43:03,486 --> 00:43:04,654
I can't say what I mean.

551
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,672
Just friends?

552
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,802
Forever?

553
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,475
I see...

554
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,692
I'm the one who's dense!

555
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:27,372
The parcel delivery left this with me.

556
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,875
Thank you...again!

557
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,391
You don't have to do this!

558
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,060
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.

559
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,146
Oh, you're home...

560
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,398
Shizuku?

561
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,981
Hi.

562
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,693
Have you been shut out, too?

563
00:46:23,332 --> 00:46:25,126
Do you live here?

564
00:46:25,146 --> 00:46:26,940
Are you hungry?

565
00:46:30,506 --> 00:46:32,216
You're not very nice.

566
00:46:32,236 --> 00:46:33,946
Just like me.

567
00:46:36,595 --> 00:46:39,244
Why do we change, I wonder?

568
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:41,913
I was always so sweet...

569
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:46,344
Books don't even excite me like they used to.

570
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:53,685
There's always someone inside me saying, 'Things aren't that easy!' I'm not very nice.

571
00:47:19,055 --> 00:47:19,869
Hey!

572
00:47:19,889 --> 00:47:20,703
Tsukishima!

573
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,549
Moon lets you pet him?

574
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,968
Moon, you're not coming in?

575
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,803
Is that his name?

576
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,056
He's like a full moon.

577
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,725
That's why I call him that.

578
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:40,023
Isn't he yours?

579
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,900
He won't stay in one house.

580
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:45,320
I heard him called 'Ball' at one place.

581
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,739
I'm sure there's others.

582
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,700
So he does the rounds...

583
00:47:51,962 --> 00:47:53,339
Yes!

584
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,736
He commutes, on the train!

585
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:56,539
The train?

586
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:58,365
Yes, by himself!

587
00:47:58,385 --> 00:47:59,949
That's how I came here.

588
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:01,533
I followed him.

589
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:06,549
And he brought me to a neat store, just like out of a story.

590
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,551
I insulted him.

591
00:48:09,313 --> 00:48:11,670
I said he wasn't very nice.

592
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:14,047
Just like me.

593
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,602
You're not like Moon at all!

594
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:21,564
He's half-devil, he is.

595
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:29,855
- Um...

596
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:30,439
- Would you...

597
00:48:32,962 --> 00:48:34,944
Is your grandfather sick?

598
00:48:34,964 --> 00:48:36,946
The store's been closed and I thought...

599
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:38,447
He's fine.

600
00:48:38,467 --> 00:48:39,781
It's a weird store.

601
00:48:39,801 --> 00:48:41,115
He doesn't open very often.

602
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,128
I'm glad he's all right.

603
00:48:43,305 --> 00:48:45,204
I can't see Baron through the window.

604
00:48:45,224 --> 00:48:47,123
Did he sell him?

605
00:48:47,309 --> 00:48:48,415
That cat doll?

606
00:48:48,435 --> 00:48:49,541
You want to see it?

607
00:48:49,561 --> 00:48:50,667
Come on.

608
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,230
Close the door.

609
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,836
It's like we're in the sky!

610
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,512
Afraid of heights?

611
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:36,233
No, I like high places.

612
00:49:36,253 --> 00:49:37,796
This is great.

613
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,691
This is the time it looks best.

614
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:47,859
In here.

615
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,383
Perfect timing.

616
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,552
Sit there.

617
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,221
The clock's gone!

618
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,473
The one that was there?

619
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,060
Grandpa's delivering it today.

620
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,770
Did he sell it?

621
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,231
It was here being fixed.

622
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:29,317
I wanted to see it again.

623
00:50:29,453 --> 00:50:31,330
It took three years.

624
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:33,227
He finished it the day you forgot your lunch.

625
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,906
That lunch!

626
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,742
I know it wasn't yours.

627
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,953
Look into the cat's eyes.

628
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,832
Quick, before the light goes.

629
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,598
Engelzimmer... 'angel's room'.

630
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:04,102
The artisan accidentally scratched it with a cloth.

631
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,770
It's beautiful.

632
00:51:06,073 --> 00:51:07,658
The Baron won't go.

633
00:51:07,678 --> 00:51:09,263
He's a treasure.

634
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:10,942
A treasure?

635
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,998
It means something to him.

636
00:51:14,018 --> 00:51:15,937
He won't say what, though.

637
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:17,876
Look as long as you like.

638
00:51:17,896 --> 00:51:19,439
I'll be downstairs.

639
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,456
Turn on the light if you want.

640
00:51:38,647 --> 00:51:41,213
It's weird.

641
00:51:41,233 --> 00:51:43,799
I feel as if I've known you for years.

642
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:46,519
Sometimes I really want to see you...

643
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,818
You look sad today, somehow...

644
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,049
Had enough?

645
00:52:58,185 --> 00:52:59,103
Yeah.

646
00:52:59,123 --> 00:53:00,041
Thanks.

647
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:03,096
Are you making a violin?

648
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:04,889
Uh, yeah.

649
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:07,725
Can I see?

650
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,731
It fits like this.

651
00:53:15,536 --> 00:53:16,871
You made all that?

652
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:18,226
By hand?

653
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:19,737
Sure!

654
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,572
Amazing!

655
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:24,909
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.

656
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:28,413
The sound comes from the craftsman's skill.

657
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,582
You made all those?

658
00:53:31,927 --> 00:53:33,825
No way!

659
00:53:33,845 --> 00:53:35,743
There's a violin-making class here.

660
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,256
But one of them is yours?

661
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:39,424
Yeah.

662
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,592
Which one?

663
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:42,760
That one.

664
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,804
This one?

665
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,588
Wow!

666
00:53:46,608 --> 00:53:48,256
You made this?

667
00:53:48,276 --> 00:53:49,924
It's like magic!

668
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:54,272
How can you talk like that with a straight face?

669
00:53:54,908 --> 00:53:56,243
Why?

670
00:53:56,263 --> 00:53:57,598
It's what I think.

671
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,445
Anyone can do that.

672
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,573
I've got a long way to go.

673
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,957
You can play, can't you?

674
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,041
A little.

675
00:54:14,178 --> 00:54:15,388
Play for me, okay?

676
00:54:15,408 --> 00:54:16,618
Please!

677
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:17,795
Listen...

678
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,465
Please please please!

679
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,301
You have to sing, too.

680
00:54:24,646 --> 00:54:25,793
Me?

681
00:54:25,813 --> 00:54:26,960
I'm tone-deaf!

682
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:28,473
Perfect!

683
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:46,293
Sing.

684
00:54:46,313 --> 00:54:47,481
You know this song.

685
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:16,854
'Had a dream of living on my own...

686
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:22,527
'...with no fear of being all alone.

687
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:27,698
'Pushed my sadness down inside of me...

688
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:32,703
'...and pretended I was strong as I could be.

689
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:38,209
'Country road, this old road...

690
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:43,714
'If you go right to the end...

691
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:49,387
'Got a feeling it'll take me...

692
00:55:49,555 --> 00:56:00,606
'...to that town, country road.' 'It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be...

693
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:06,237
'I will never ever let a tear show in my eye...

694
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:12,285
'If my feet are moving faster that's because I only want to...

695
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:17,081
'...push away memories...

696
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:22,545
'Country road, this old road...

697
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:28,259
'...could go right to my home town...

698
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:33,764
'I won't go there, I can't go there...

699
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:39,103
'...can't go down that country road.

700
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:44,609
'Country road, when tomorrow comes...

701
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:50,448
'I'll be like I always am...

702
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:56,120
'Want to go back there, can't go back there...

703
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,956
'Fare thee well...

704
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:38,996
'...country road.' That was fun!

705
00:57:41,677 --> 00:57:41,760
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima.

706
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:41,863
We met the other day.

707
00:57:41,885 --> 00:57:43,595
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima.

708
00:57:43,615 --> 00:57:45,325
We met the other day.

709
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:51,175
I was hoping you'd come back again.

710
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:54,178
These are my musical friends.

711
00:57:54,815 --> 00:57:57,484
Nice singing.

712
00:57:57,504 --> 00:58:00,173
You're the lucky one who was there when he fixed the clock...

713
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,521
Seiji has some pretty friends.

714
00:58:03,991 --> 00:58:06,098
'Seiji'?

715
00:58:06,118 --> 00:58:08,225
Are you Seiji Amasawa?

716
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:11,737
Yeah...didn't I tell you my name?

717
00:58:12,165 --> 00:58:13,834
No!

718
00:58:13,854 --> 00:58:15,523
It says 'Nishi' outside.

719
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,963
That's Grandpa's name.

720
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,526
I'm Amasawa.

721
00:58:19,881 --> 00:58:22,343
Oh, no!

722
00:58:22,363 --> 00:58:24,825
First I was buried alive, and now the sky's fallen in!

723
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:28,879
What difference does it make what my name is?

724
00:58:29,016 --> 00:58:30,663
A lot!

725
00:58:30,683 --> 00:58:32,330
You've been calling me by my full name!

726
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,593
You never asked me mine!

727
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,846
I never had the chance!

728
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:40,349
My image of Seiji Amasawa...

729
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,434
What?

730
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,519
...was someone quiet and gentle.

731
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,855
You read too many books.

732
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,190
So do you!

733
00:59:04,134 --> 00:59:05,656
That was fun.

734
00:59:05,676 --> 00:59:07,198
They're nice people.

735
00:59:07,637 --> 00:59:08,847
Come back.

736
00:59:08,867 --> 00:59:10,077
They'll like that.

737
00:59:10,223 --> 00:59:11,683
Just to listen.

738
00:59:11,703 --> 00:59:13,163
Singing's too hard.

739
00:59:13,977 --> 00:59:15,896
But you're a good violinist.

740
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:17,835
Is that what you want to do?

741
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,681
There's lots as good as me.

742
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,976
What I want to do is make violins.

743
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:26,979
Yeah...you're good at that.

744
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:31,025
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.

745
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,986
I want to go there.

746
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,489
And not go to high school?

747
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:40,024
My parents are dead against it.

748
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:43,110
Grandpa's my only ally.

749
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:58,135
It must be great to know what you want to do.

750
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,003
I've got no idea at all.

751
01:00:01,023 --> 01:00:03,296
I just go from one day to the next.

752
01:00:03,985 --> 01:00:06,384
I don't know if I can go or not.

753
01:00:06,404 --> 01:00:08,803
I fight with my parents every day.

754
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:14,485
Even if I go, I won't know if I have the talent until I try.

755
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:19,073
I'll see you home.

756
01:00:19,209 --> 01:00:20,752
No, it's not far.

757
01:00:20,772 --> 01:00:22,315
See you.

758
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,829
Tsukishima...

759
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,831
Yeah?

760
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,125
You've got a talent for poetry.

761
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:33,838
What you sang back there was fine, but I liked 'Concrete Roads', too.

762
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,841
You told me to forget that!

763
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,676
Did I say that?

764
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:40,010
Yes!

765
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,679
I did?

766
01:00:43,692 --> 01:00:44,922
Thanks for everything.

767
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:46,172
Good night.

768
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:09,373
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.

769
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,216
When did you decide on your future?

770
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,217
What?

771
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:22,094
Your future!

772
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,889
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?

773
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,891
I don't mean that!

774
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:29,894
I'm at university finding that out.

775
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,063
Good night.

776
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:34,565
Good night.

777
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:52,416
Mom's class is canceled so now she sleeps in!

778
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:03,260
Morning!

779
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,762
Morning!

780
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,097
Run faster!

781
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,933
You go ahead!

782
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:28,327
Hour 1: Spare Period Great!

783
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,454
Shizuku!

784
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,289
You look awful!

785
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,125
You sure got better fast!

786
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,962
I hear you were out with a boy last night.

787
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,130
Who told you that?!

788
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:43,050
A little bird...who said you were like lovers.

789
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,635
We are not!

790
01:02:52,821 --> 01:02:54,886
Harada...I'll tell my friend the answer's no.

791
01:02:54,906 --> 01:02:56,971
Sorry.

792
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,984
I'm sorry, too.

793
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:01,610
That's okay.

794
01:03:06,209 --> 01:03:08,086
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?

795
01:03:08,106 --> 01:03:09,983
It was great!

796
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:21,338
This formula will be on the mid-term, so remember it!

797
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,341
That's all!

798
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,031
Is Tsukishima here?

799
01:03:48,209 --> 01:03:48,939
Amasawa?

800
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:49,689
What do you want?

801
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,202
Is Tsukishima in this class?

802
01:03:52,714 --> 01:03:54,132
Tsukishima?

803
01:03:54,152 --> 01:03:55,570
Yeah, she's here.

804
01:03:55,884 --> 01:03:57,031
Tsukishima!

805
01:03:57,051 --> 01:03:58,198
You've got a visitor!

806
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,376
A male!

807
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:05,716
There she is.

808
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,511
Seiji?

809
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:12,056
Can I talk to you?

810
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,058
Yes!

811
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:17,561
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!

812
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:23,567
No, I don't!

813
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,909
What is it?

814
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:34,411
I'm going to Italy.

815
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,579
What?

816
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,414
Come with me.

817
01:04:41,763 --> 01:04:42,952
- Where are we going?

818
01:04:42,972 --> 01:04:44,161
- The roof!

819
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,097
Wow!

820
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:58,268
We can't talk with all those people around.

821
01:04:58,613 --> 01:05:00,323
Sorry.

822
01:05:00,343 --> 01:05:02,053
I wanted to tell you first.

823
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:07,778
Let them think what they want.

824
01:05:08,456 --> 01:05:10,354
My dad finally gave in.

825
01:05:10,374 --> 01:05:12,272
On one condition.

826
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:14,284
What's that?

827
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:19,456
I apprentice in a workshop there for two months.

828
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,291
Apprentice?

829
01:05:21,636 --> 01:05:23,784
The guy who runs it's very strict.

830
01:05:23,804 --> 01:05:25,952
He'll see if I have talent or not.

831
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:30,300
Also if I have the patience to stick it out.

832
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:33,303
Otherwise I go to high school.

833
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:37,307
I hate that they're leaving an escape route...

834
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,143
...but it's a good chance.

835
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,978
When do you go?

836
01:05:41,322 --> 01:05:43,554
As soon as I get my passport.

837
01:05:43,574 --> 01:05:45,806
Dad's talking to the school today.

838
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,651
Soon, then...

839
01:05:49,247 --> 01:05:50,269
Great!

840
01:05:50,289 --> 01:05:51,311
Your dream's coming true.

841
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:54,658
Well, I'll do the best I can.

842
01:05:57,172 --> 01:05:57,652
- Um...

843
01:05:57,672 --> 01:05:58,152
- Well...

844
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,499
The rain's stopping.

845
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:03,667
Yeah...

846
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,336
Look over there.

847
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,844
There might be a rainbow...

848
01:06:25,325 --> 01:06:27,682
What's Cremona like?

849
01:06:27,702 --> 01:06:30,059
I hope it's nice.

850
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:35,866
It's an old town, with lots of violin makers.

851
01:06:36,044 --> 01:06:37,942
It's great.

852
01:06:37,962 --> 01:06:39,860
You're on your way.

853
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,372
I feel like a fool.

854
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,043
I was hoping we'd go to the same high school...

855
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,713
What a stupid thing to think...

856
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:12,069
I saw your name on the library cards a long time ago.

857
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:16,073
We passed each other in the library.

858
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:20,077
I even sat beside you there.

859
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:26,917
I read all kinds of books so my name would be on the cards before yours.

860
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:29,753
I...

861
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:34,883
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.

862
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:41,098
Me, too.

863
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,768
Don't push!

864
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:52,776
Hey!

865
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,281
Look out, she's mad!

866
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:00,450
Run!

867
01:08:34,495 --> 01:08:35,017
- Here.

868
01:08:35,037 --> 01:08:35,559
- Thanks.

869
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:36,695
Excuse me.

870
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,323
Finished already?

871
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:41,992
I'm meeting Yuko.

872
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,331
If you're by the station, get some milk.

873
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:51,668
You're the one who drinks it all!

874
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:55,339
She's slacking off these days.

875
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:16,767
- Did I make you skip cram school?

876
01:09:16,787 --> 01:09:18,184
- It's alright.

877
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:20,030
My head's in a whirl.

878
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:22,532
Hello, Shizuku.

879
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,867
Hello.

880
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,038
Hi.

881
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:29,706
Hello.

882
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:33,710
I'll make some tea.

883
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:38,548
Dad and I aren't speaking.

884
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,224
Boys are so lucky!

885
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:54,398
When he comes back to graduate, he goes again for ten years!

886
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:56,733
That's like forever!

887
01:09:57,745 --> 01:09:59,643
But it's like fate brought you together!

888
01:09:59,663 --> 01:10:01,561
Cool!

889
01:10:01,749 --> 01:10:04,231
It's too good to last.

890
01:10:04,251 --> 01:10:06,733
Two people read the same books...

891
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,622
...except one's going forward while the other stays behind.

892
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,582
Yeah...

893
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:16,878
Kinuyo was in his class for a year.

894
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:21,633
She said he was hard to get to know, but good-looking and smart.

895
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:25,762
Don't tell me that, will you!

896
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,639
I just feel worse!

897
01:10:27,942 --> 01:10:29,034
Why?

898
01:10:29,054 --> 01:10:30,146
He likes you, doesn't he?

899
01:10:30,166 --> 01:10:31,258
He told you!

900
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,437
Now I'm not so sure...

901
01:10:36,784 --> 01:10:39,704
I don't get it.

902
01:10:39,724 --> 01:10:42,644
I'd write every day... we'd encourage each other...

903
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:47,159
You can't say 'go for it' to someone more ambitious than you.

904
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:49,119
Maybe...

905
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:54,166
But I don't understand what you want.

906
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:57,586
Can't you be in love without your future planned out?

907
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:01,798
You have talent.

908
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:05,635
All the juniors liked your translation of 'Country Roads'.

909
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:09,473
You can express yourself, too... unlike me.

910
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:14,269
'There's lots as good as me'.

911
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:16,688
That's what he said.

912
01:11:16,824 --> 01:11:18,868
He's going to find out if he has talent.

913
01:11:18,888 --> 01:11:20,932
Well, so will I!

914
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,947
I'll write a story!

915
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:27,961
There's one I want to write.

916
01:11:27,981 --> 01:11:29,775
If he can do it, so can I.

917
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,370
But it's exam time...

918
01:11:32,507 --> 01:11:33,863
I don't care.

919
01:11:33,883 --> 01:11:35,239
Thanks, Yuko.

920
01:11:35,259 --> 01:11:36,615
I feel empowered.

921
01:11:37,011 --> 01:11:37,721
- You going?

922
01:11:37,741 --> 01:11:38,451
- Yeah.

923
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:43,632
Good night.

924
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:46,134
Tell your mother hello.

925
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,306
You go for it, too.

926
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:57,020
Sugimura will realize.

927
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:58,647
'Bye.

928
01:12:00,618 --> 01:12:02,662
It's so easy!

929
01:12:02,682 --> 01:12:04,726
I just have to do something, too!

930
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:09,825
Moon?

931
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,497
Muta?

932
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:17,677
Mom!

933
01:12:17,697 --> 01:12:19,324
Muta's gone again!

934
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,002
Muta!

935
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:23,171
'Muta' ...

936
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:31,847
'Whisper of the Heart': Listen to the voice of the woods...

937
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:59,249
The Baron as the hero?

938
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:01,710
Would you mind?

939
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:07,048
I ask because Seiji says the doll is a treasure of yours...

940
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,260
You didn't have to ask!

941
01:13:10,855 --> 01:13:12,607
Of course you can.

942
01:13:12,627 --> 01:13:14,379
But on one condition.

943
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:16,766
Yes?

944
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:21,897
That you let me be the first person to read your story.

945
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:24,232
Um...

946
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:26,234
All right?

947
01:13:26,537 --> 01:13:29,040
Do I have to?

948
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:31,563
I don't know if I can write it or not...

949
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:37,245
It's the same for a craftsman.

950
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:40,582
Don't expect perfection at first.

951
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,627
Here, let me show you something.

952
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:51,593
This.

953
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:56,932
Look at it.

954
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:07,776
It's called 'mica slate'.

955
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:10,278
Look at the seam.

956
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:12,447
Like that...

957
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,876
It's beautiful!

958
01:14:25,262 --> 01:14:27,681
It's called 'beryl'.

959
01:14:27,701 --> 01:14:30,120
You find it in emerald ore.

960
01:14:30,518 --> 01:14:31,436
Emerald?

961
01:14:31,456 --> 01:14:32,374
The jewel?

962
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:33,259
Yes.

963
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:36,972
You and Seiji are like this stone.

964
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:40,308
Rough, unpolished, still natural.

965
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,812
I like stones that way.

966
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:48,817
But making violins, or writing stories, is different.

967
01:14:49,704 --> 01:14:51,998
The rough stone is inside you.

968
01:14:52,018 --> 01:14:54,312
You have to find it and then polish it.

969
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:56,408
It takes time and effort.

970
01:14:57,535 --> 01:15:00,870
You see the ore that makes up most of that stone?

971
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:02,205
Yes.

972
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:07,711
You could polish that, but what you'd get would be worthless.

973
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:11,381
The smaller part inside is purer.

974
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:16,886
There might even be a better stone deep inside where we can't see.

975
01:15:17,398 --> 01:15:19,525
I'm sorry.

976
01:15:19,545 --> 01:15:21,672
Old people like to preach.

977
01:15:23,571 --> 01:15:25,636
I'm scared.

978
01:15:25,656 --> 01:15:27,721
What if there isn't a beautiful crystal in me?

979
01:15:28,576 --> 01:15:30,558
But I want to write.

980
01:15:30,578 --> 01:15:32,560
And you'll be the first one to see it.

981
01:15:32,705 --> 01:15:34,227
Thank you.

982
01:15:34,247 --> 01:15:35,769
I'll look forward to it.

983
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:47,917
A rough stone...lapis lazuli...

984
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:54,424
Let us go forth together...

985
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:57,594
...in search of the treasure of lapis lazuli!

986
01:15:59,607 --> 01:16:01,672
Have no fear.

987
01:16:01,692 --> 01:16:03,757
Space is deformed on the night of the new moon.

988
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:10,940
Faraway things loom large, nearby things look small.

989
01:16:14,371 --> 01:16:15,727
Fly!

990
01:16:15,747 --> 01:16:17,103
We will rise on the updraft.

991
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:24,778
Make haste!

992
01:16:24,798 --> 01:16:26,446
The planetoids converge!

993
01:16:39,063 --> 01:16:40,085
Good!

994
01:16:40,105 --> 01:16:41,127
We're riding the wind!

995
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,682
Straight up to that castle!

996
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:46,810
It's so high!

997
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:49,646
It's not so high once you're there!

998
01:17:08,634 --> 01:17:11,137
Go!

999
01:17:11,157 --> 01:17:13,660
When the air currents mingle in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!

1000
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:16,506
Huh?

1001
01:17:20,771 --> 01:17:23,128
That's rare!

1002
01:17:23,148 --> 01:17:25,505
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...

1003
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:07,849
He's making a violin in his cell...

1004
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,091
Seiji!

1005
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:45,261
I thought you'd gone!

1006
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:48,264
Grandpa said I might find you here.

1007
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,101
I leave tomorrow.

1008
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:53,937
Tomorrow...

1009
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:58,098
Don't worry.

1010
01:18:58,118 --> 01:19:00,266
I'll wait here till you're done.

1011
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:28,638
Sorry I can't walk you home.

1012
01:19:28,983 --> 01:19:30,526
That's okay.

1013
01:19:30,546 --> 01:19:32,089
I'm glad you came.

1014
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,478
I can't come to the airport, but I'll wait for you.

1015
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:38,064
It's only two months.

1016
01:19:44,665 --> 01:19:47,502
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.

1017
01:19:47,522 --> 01:19:50,359
I'll do my best while you're gone.

1018
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,669
I'll see you, then.

1019
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,674
Have a good trip!

1020
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:28,031
Luisa, my betrothed, and I were born in a distant land.

1021
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:35,538
In that town, magic still lived...

1022
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:40,877
...and in the veins of its artisans flowed the blood of sorcerers.

1023
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:52,055
It was a poor doll-maker's apprentice who fashioned us...

1024
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:58,227
...but Luisa and I were happy...

1025
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:02,565
...because he had made us so we could love others.

1026
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:04,901
But then...

1027
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:12,909
Shizuku...

1028
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:14,702
Shizuku!

1029
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:17,580
Shizuku!

1030
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:21,804
What's going on?

1031
01:21:21,824 --> 01:21:23,368
Tsukishima!

1032
01:21:24,598 --> 01:21:25,745
I'm sorry.

1033
01:21:25,765 --> 01:21:26,912
I wasn't listening.

1034
01:21:27,101 --> 01:21:28,331
Pay attention!

1035
01:21:28,351 --> 01:21:29,581
This is important!

1036
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,760
Sorry, sir.

1037
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:32,762
Harada, you read.

1038
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:38,434
You were up until 4 again?!

1039
01:21:38,612 --> 01:21:39,926
It's okay.

1040
01:21:39,946 --> 01:21:41,260
I'm not sleepy at all.

1041
01:21:41,407 --> 01:21:43,868
But you're spaced out all the time!

1042
01:21:43,888 --> 01:21:46,349
Like just now...

1043
01:21:46,495 --> 01:21:48,643
I was thinking.

1044
01:21:48,663 --> 01:21:50,811
I've got to organize what I want to write.

1045
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:54,951
I'm not hungry.

1046
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:24,887
Shizuku?

1047
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:26,304
So you are home...

1048
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,985
Turn on the lights!

1049
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:32,989
At least you could bring in the laundry!

1050
01:22:33,584 --> 01:22:34,981
Shizuku!

1051
01:22:35,001 --> 01:22:36,398
Come here!

1052
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,789
Shizuku's here, isn't she?

1053
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,916
She's not hungry.

1054
01:23:08,535 --> 01:23:10,100
- Thank you for coming.

1055
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,685
- Sorry to trouble you.

1056
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:15,448
This way...is anyone in the guidance office?

1057
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:18,034
Please.

1058
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:25,541
I'm back!

1059
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,046
Hello.

1060
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:32,715
You're home early, Shiho.

1061
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,552
I'm beat!

1062
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:37,887
Want some coffee?

1063
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:39,222
Yes, please.

1064
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:44,894
Mom, can I talk to you?

1065
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:46,229
What?

1066
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:53,903
I'm thinking of moving out.

1067
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:56,239
I've found a place.

1068
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:58,574
But can you afford it?

1069
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:01,077
I've saved from my job.

1070
01:24:01,421 --> 01:24:03,131
I found another one at a cram school.

1071
01:24:03,151 --> 01:24:04,861
I'll get by.

1072
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:09,418
I guess I've made you help me out too much around here.

1073
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:12,588
I'll talk to your father.

1074
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:14,164
You will?

1075
01:24:14,184 --> 01:24:15,248
Great!

1076
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:21,597
Money's tight till I graduate in the spring and get working...

1077
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,599
...but I'll help you out then.

1078
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:25,476
Sounds good.

1079
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:28,604
Sorry to go during your master's thesis...

1080
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:29,939
Thanks.

1081
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:34,068
You helped enough just with sorting out data.

1082
01:24:34,454 --> 01:24:37,145
And Shizuku can concentrate in her own room.

1083
01:24:37,165 --> 01:24:39,856
She's acting weird.

1084
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:41,617
You think so too?

1085
01:24:42,629 --> 01:24:44,214
The school called me.

1086
01:24:44,234 --> 01:24:45,819
Look at this.

1087
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:47,790
What is it?

1088
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:52,128
She's gone down a hundred places!

1089
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:57,300
She's at her desk all the time... what's she doing?

1090
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:06,475
Good evening.

1091
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:08,311
Hello.

1092
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:11,981
Excuse me.

1093
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:21,073
What high school will take you with marks like this?!

1094
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,492
I'm not going to high school!

1095
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:26,548
Use your head!

1096
01:25:26,568 --> 01:25:29,446
What can you do with a middle-school education?

1097
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:32,043
I can decide my own future!

1098
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:33,586
Watch your mouth!

1099
01:25:33,722 --> 01:25:35,995
Face the facts!

1100
01:25:36,015 --> 01:25:38,288
The school makes its report on you after the second term!

1101
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:40,551
You're a fine one to talk!

1102
01:25:40,729 --> 01:25:42,189
You don't study!

1103
01:25:42,209 --> 01:25:43,669
You just work part-time!

1104
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:46,182
I do what I have to!

1105
01:25:46,735 --> 01:25:48,904
You're the one who isn't doing that!

1106
01:25:48,924 --> 01:25:51,093
Don't you understand?

1107
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:55,066
I've got something more important to do!

1108
01:25:55,369 --> 01:25:56,766
Like what?

1109
01:25:56,786 --> 01:25:58,183
Tell me.

1110
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:02,531
Shiho, Shizuku...that's enough.

1111
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:06,077
But Dad...listen to this girl!

1112
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:09,705
Both of you come out here and tell me about it.

1113
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:12,541
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.

1114
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:16,045
Come on.

1115
01:26:30,153 --> 01:26:32,093
I see.

1116
01:26:32,113 --> 01:26:34,053
Is it true what Shiho says?

1117
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:36,399
I do so care about my marks!

1118
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:38,901
You just said you weren't going to high school.

1119
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:41,737
You said I wouldn't get into one!

1120
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:46,409
Shiho...can Shizuku and I talk alone for a bit?

1121
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:47,493
Yes.

1122
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:51,247
Where's your mother?

1123
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:52,748
At the Tanakas.

1124
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:54,250
I'm back.

1125
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,460
Hi, Mom.

1126
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:57,920
Is your dad back?

1127
01:26:58,932 --> 01:27:00,997
Could you come here, Asako?

1128
01:27:01,017 --> 01:27:03,082
I've been hearing about Shizuku.

1129
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,427
Coming.

1130
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,268
All right, Shizuku...

1131
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:18,482
Is what you're doing now more important than studying?

1132
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:22,945
Can you tell me what it is?

1133
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:25,781
When it's time.

1134
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:30,327
Is this something you have to do right away?

1135
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:33,956
I've only got three weeks left to do it!

1136
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:37,793
I'm testing myself.

1137
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:39,336
I have to.

1138
01:27:39,639 --> 01:27:41,204
Testing yourself?

1139
01:27:41,224 --> 01:27:42,789
How?

1140
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:47,011
How will we know if you don't say?

1141
01:27:48,972 --> 01:27:51,849
Is it something you can't even tell us?

1142
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,143
Seiya!

1143
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:56,312
Oh...sorry.

1144
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:12,661
Whatever you're doing at the library, I admire how hard you're working.

1145
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:16,665
Let's let her do what she wants.

1146
01:28:17,876 --> 01:28:20,503
Not everyone has to be the same.

1147
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:26,675
I should know that if anyone does...

1148
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:31,514
Okay, Shizuku, do what you believe in.

1149
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:36,685
But it's not easy when you walk your own road.

1150
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:39,855
You've only got yourself to blame.

1151
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:44,860
And join us at mealtimes, all right?

1152
01:28:45,038 --> 01:28:45,935
Yeah.

1153
01:28:45,955 --> 01:28:46,852
We're a family.

1154
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,030
Yes.

1155
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:50,032
Call Shiho.

1156
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:54,370
I'll make some tea.

1157
01:28:57,707 --> 01:28:58,874
Shizuku...

1158
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:05,339
I know what Dad said, but what he really wants is for you to study.

1159
01:29:05,475 --> 01:29:06,893
I know.

1160
01:29:06,913 --> 01:29:08,331
It's written on his face.

1161
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:11,720
I'm moving out next Sunday.

1162
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,348
You'll have your own room.

1163
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:16,225
You're leaving home?

1164
01:29:16,403 --> 01:29:17,404
Yep.

1165
01:29:17,424 --> 01:29:18,425
So smarten up!

1166
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:30,531
Hurry!

1167
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:32,908
Hurry!

1168
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:36,912
Only the one is real.

1169
01:29:37,247 --> 01:29:39,456
Which is the real one?!

1170
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:40,666
Hurry!

1171
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:42,209
Hurry!

1172
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:44,420
Hurry!

1173
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:28,691
Luisa...you've finally come... but I've grown so old...

1174
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:56,552
Shizuku...

1175
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:00,889
Come in...I was fast asleep.

1176
01:32:02,193 --> 01:32:04,675
I'm sorry to bother you.

1177
01:32:04,695 --> 01:32:07,177
I've brought my story.

1178
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:13,402
It's finished?

1179
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:18,907
I promised you'd be the first to read it.

1180
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:21,160
It's a novel!

1181
01:32:21,296 --> 01:32:25,592
'Whisper of the Heart' Can you read it now?

1182
01:32:25,612 --> 01:32:29,908
I'll wait as long as it takes.

1183
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:35,424
But you've worked so hard on it... shouldn't I take my time?

1184
01:32:35,602 --> 01:32:38,314
You can stop if you don't like it.

1185
01:32:38,334 --> 01:32:41,046
I hate to ask, but...

1186
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:44,099
My heart's pounding...

1187
01:32:44,736 --> 01:32:46,071
I see.

1188
01:32:46,091 --> 01:32:47,426
I'll read it right now.

1189
01:32:47,572 --> 01:32:49,199
Come sit by the fire.

1190
01:32:49,219 --> 01:32:50,846
It's cold.

1191
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:58,280
Now we won't be bothered.

1192
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:05,621
Can I wait downstairs?

1193
01:33:06,925 --> 01:33:08,093
It's okay.

1194
01:33:08,113 --> 01:33:09,281
I'm not cold at all.

1195
01:33:10,794 --> 01:33:14,463
Of course...but...

1196
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:29,538
You're asleep here?

1197
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:31,915
Shizuku...I'm finished.

1198
01:34:34,387 --> 01:34:35,534
Thank you.

1199
01:34:35,554 --> 01:34:36,701
It's very good.

1200
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,547
It's not!

1201
01:34:38,892 --> 01:34:40,623
Say what you really think!

1202
01:34:40,643 --> 01:34:42,374
I couldn't write what I wanted!

1203
01:34:42,729 --> 01:34:44,397
The last half doesn't make sense.

1204
01:34:44,417 --> 01:34:46,085
I know that!

1205
01:34:46,264 --> 01:34:50,225
Yes...it's rough, blunt, unfinished...

1206
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:52,561
...just like Seiji's violin.

1207
01:34:55,231 --> 01:35:00,569
You've shown me the rough stone you've just cut out of the rock.

1208
01:35:01,247 --> 01:35:03,124
You've worked hard.

1209
01:35:03,144 --> 01:35:05,021
You're wonderful.

1210
01:35:06,461 --> 01:35:08,588
There's no need to rush now.

1211
01:35:08,608 --> 01:35:10,735
Take your time and polish it.

1212
01:35:35,615 --> 01:35:37,180
It's cold out here.

1213
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,765
Come inside.

1214
01:35:38,942 --> 01:35:39,942
Now...

1215
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:43,612
...now I've written it I know.

1216
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,448
Wanting isn't enough.

1217
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:49,576
I have to learn more...

1218
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:54,873
...but Seiji's getting further and further ahead.

1219
01:35:55,291 --> 01:36:00,128
I felt that I had to force myself to write, and I was so scared...

1220
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:05,133
You like Seiji, don't you?

1221
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:27,823
How is it?

1222
01:36:28,825 --> 01:36:30,117
It's very good.

1223
01:36:31,828 --> 01:36:37,082
When Seiji finished his first violin, we had ramen noodles.

1224
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:39,334
Jumbo size.

1225
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:45,674
Thank you.

1226
01:36:47,677 --> 01:36:50,512
Now, where was I?

1227
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:54,016
You found the Baron in a coffee-shop...

1228
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,018
Yes, in Germany...

1229
01:36:57,655 --> 01:36:59,741
I was a student.

1230
01:36:59,761 --> 01:37:01,847
He looked so melancholic...

1231
01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:05,235
I asked the owner to sell him to me.

1232
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:07,863
But he wouldn't.

1233
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:13,243
The Baron had a lover, and he wouldn't separate them.

1234
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:19,875
He was waiting for her to come back from being repaired...

1235
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:22,044
...at the doll-maker's shop.

1236
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:26,214
Just like in my story!

1237
01:37:26,716 --> 01:37:29,885
Yes...quite the coincidence!

1238
01:37:30,011 --> 01:37:34,056
I had to come home, so I'd just about given up.

1239
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:38,560
Then a lady friend of mine...

1240
01:37:39,228 --> 01:37:42,606
...said when the other doll came back she would take it...

1241
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:45,525
...and bring the two dolls together.

1242
01:37:45,651 --> 01:37:48,070
So the owner gave in.

1243
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:52,574
I ended up leaving Germany with just the Baron.

1244
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:59,247
And I promised her I'd come back, and asked her to keep the other doll.

1245
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:03,585
The day the dolls met again...

1246
01:38:04,253 --> 01:38:07,422
...would be the day we did.

1247
01:38:09,175 --> 01:38:14,388
But then the war started, and I couldn't keep my promise.

1248
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:21,228
When I was finally able to go back, I looked all over for her.

1249
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:27,567
But there was no trace of her, or the Baron's lover.

1250
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:32,406
She must have been very important to you...

1251
01:38:32,532 --> 01:38:39,413
Your story brought the Baron out of my memory and back to life.

1252
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:41,415
Oh, yes...

1253
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:51,758
Hold out your hand.

1254
01:38:58,141 --> 01:38:59,141
But...

1255
01:38:59,318 --> 01:39:01,550
That stone suits you perfectly.

1256
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:03,802
I'll give it to you.

1257
01:39:04,397 --> 01:39:08,108
Now, finish up your story.

1258
01:39:08,234 --> 01:39:09,317
Yes.

1259
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,460
Thank you!

1260
01:39:30,423 --> 01:39:31,965
Goodbye!

1261
01:39:42,268 --> 01:39:43,310
I'm home.

1262
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:45,145
Hi.

1263
01:39:47,857 --> 01:39:49,149
Where's Dad?

1264
01:39:49,619 --> 01:39:51,392
In the bath.

1265
01:39:51,412 --> 01:39:53,185
Where have you been till this hour?

1266
01:39:53,372 --> 01:39:56,167
I'm sorry I worried you.

1267
01:39:56,187 --> 01:39:58,982
Today I return to studying for my entrance exams.

1268
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:02,245
So your trials are over?

1269
01:40:02,455 --> 01:40:03,830
For now.

1270
01:40:05,885 --> 01:40:07,012
Did you eat?

1271
01:40:07,032 --> 01:40:08,159
There's curry...

1272
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:09,336
I'm fine!

1273
01:40:11,297 --> 01:40:12,839
'For now' ...

1274
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:25,519
Shizuku, the bath's open.

1275
01:40:45,206 --> 01:40:47,207
Ah, a soldier at ease.

1276
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:55,191
No!

1277
01:42:03,075 --> 01:42:04,784
Wait there!

1278
01:42:20,019 --> 01:42:21,062
It's a miracle!

1279
01:42:21,082 --> 01:42:22,125
You're here!

1280
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:23,803
We're not dreaming?

1281
01:42:24,065 --> 01:42:25,587
I got an earlier plane.

1282
01:42:25,607 --> 01:42:27,129
Hop on.

1283
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:30,977
Wait...you'll be cold.

1284
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:34,814
Climb on.

1285
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:37,275
I'll get a coat.

1286
01:42:37,411 --> 01:42:38,517
No time!

1287
01:42:38,537 --> 01:42:39,643
Get on.

1288
01:42:41,947 --> 01:42:43,490
Hang on tight.

1289
01:42:49,038 --> 01:42:52,916
I was out there calling you in my head.

1290
01:42:53,042 --> 01:42:57,837
'Shizuku!' And then you appeared!

1291
01:42:58,381 --> 01:42:59,756
What a team!

1292
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:04,719
Me, too...it's like I'm still dreaming!

1293
01:43:10,559 --> 01:43:12,352
How was Cremona?

1294
01:43:12,488 --> 01:43:14,240
A lot different than I thought.

1295
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:16,012
But I'm going to do it.

1296
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:18,400
It's getting light!

1297
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:28,535
Shall I get off?

1298
01:43:28,661 --> 01:43:29,703
It's alright.

1299
01:43:30,746 --> 01:43:35,875
I made up my mind I was going to ride you up this hill!

1300
01:43:36,001 --> 01:43:37,711
That's not fair!

1301
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:42,882
I'm no man's burden!

1302
01:43:46,011 --> 01:43:49,389
I want to be of use!

1303
01:43:50,526 --> 01:43:51,548
Okay!

1304
01:43:51,568 --> 01:43:52,590
Push!

1305
01:43:53,436 --> 01:43:54,728
Almost there!

1306
01:44:09,003 --> 01:44:10,546
Shizuku!

1307
01:44:10,566 --> 01:44:12,109
Jump on!

1308
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:31,431
We made it!

1309
01:44:36,405 --> 01:44:37,407
- I'll hold the coat.

1310
01:44:37,427 --> 01:44:38,429
- I'm fine.

1311
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:42,942
Here...

1312
01:45:00,095 --> 01:45:01,931
Wow!

1313
01:45:01,951 --> 01:45:03,787
In the mist it looks just like the sea!

1314
01:45:03,933 --> 01:45:05,893
This is my secret place.

1315
01:45:05,913 --> 01:45:07,873
It's almost time.

1316
01:45:52,638 --> 01:45:55,014
I wanted you to see this.

1317
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:01,187
Grandpa told me everything.

1318
01:46:01,323 --> 01:46:03,576
I didn't do anything to help...

1319
01:46:03,596 --> 01:46:05,849
I was just thinking of myself.

1320
01:46:05,985 --> 01:46:09,195
No...you were the reason I did it.

1321
01:46:09,999 --> 01:46:12,418
I'm glad I pushed myself.

1322
01:46:12,438 --> 01:46:14,857
I understand myself better now.

1323
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:20,456
I'm going to study hard and go on to high school.

1324
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:23,209
Listen, Shizuku...

1325
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:28,047
...I can't say how soon it'll be, but...

1326
01:46:28,757 --> 01:46:30,967
...would you marry me?

1327
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:36,598
I'm going to be a violin maker... and then...

1328
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:42,812
You mean it?

1329
01:46:42,938 --> 01:46:46,232
That's exactly what I wanted.

1330
01:46:46,452 --> 01:46:47,453
Yeah?

1331
01:46:47,473 --> 01:46:48,474
Great!

1332
01:46:48,861 --> 01:46:52,113
Wait...it's cold...

1333
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:55,408
Shizuku...I love you!

1334
01:47:05,628 --> 01:50:47,849
