1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:35,286
Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DYMP, Walt Disney Japan, Mitsubishi, Toho and KDDI present In this world, there's an invisible magic circle.

2
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:44,347
- So you did date him!

3
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:45,452
- What?

4
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,427
There's inside and outside.

5
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,764
Capture the movement.

6
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,734
- It's hard.

7
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:56,548
- Right?

8
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:58,153
- Let's see.

9
00:00:58,173 --> 00:00:59,592
- Hey, no looking!

10
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,896
These people are inside.

11
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,777
And I'm outside.

12
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,155
But I don't really care.

13
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,783
How's it coming?

14
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:20,831
Um, I... kind of messed up.

15
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,125
Let me have a look.

16
00:01:35,147 --> 00:01:35,962
Oh, no.

17
00:01:35,982 --> 00:01:36,797
Are you okay?

18
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:43,198
Hey, hey---

19
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:49,308
I...

20
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:53,864
I hate myself.

21
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,677
Anna...

22
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,013
You're fine now.

23
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,026
Oh, I'm so glad.

24
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:21,882
Thank you, Doctor.

25
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,147
Anna, do you feel all right now?

26
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,523
I'm fine.

27
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,818
You looked like you were in agony.

28
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,862
Where was your inhaler?

29
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,699
I cost you money again.

30
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,243
Why do you say that?

31
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,206
Oh, Miyoko.

32
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:46,719
I brought Anna's bag.

33
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,616
Her notebook is inside.

34
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,212
Why, thank you.

35
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:51,954
We were just nearby.

36
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:53,539
If there's anything else...

37
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:55,551
Wait...

38
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,346
Has Anna been getting along with you?

39
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,849
She tells me nothing about school.

40
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,726
She's okay.

41
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,853
But she's very quiet.

42
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:07,490
Quiet?

43
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,261
More like...

44
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,065
Hey, don't.

45
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,860
We're just a bit loud.

46
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,864
Well, take care.

47
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,492
Ever the worrywart, your mother.

48
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,414
Mother. . .?

49
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:31,712
She's probably a hermit at school.

50
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:36,008
It's true that stress can trigger asthma attacks.

51
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:39,303
Meanwhile, my husband's off on a business trip.

52
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:44,058
Maybe he and I are partly to blame, too.

53
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,393
12 years old...

54
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,729
It's a difficult age.

55
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,483
Have you noticed anything about her?

56
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,488
She... always has an ordinary face.

57
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,573
Ordinary face?

58
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:03,827
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,625
Like she won't show her emotions...

60
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,753
She used to be more expressive.

61
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:17,341
But these days, I don't even know...

62
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:24,848
Maybe it's because we're not related by blood.

63
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:30,688
You may want to send her somewhere to get better.

64
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:46,620
7:03 Departure for KUSHIRO Say, Anna...

65
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,500
Do you remember Uncle and Aunt Oiwa?

66
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,630
The air is very clean where they live.

67
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:04,513
It'll help your condition to spend some time there.

68
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:10,602
I can't go with you, but they'll take care of you.

69
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:17,026
Be a good girl, eat well, and come back nice and happy.

70
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,866
She whines like a goat.

71
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,538
Oh, here she is.

72
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,832
Anna.

73
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,047
Remember us?

74
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,217
No, but Auntie told me all about you.

75
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,843
I'm Anna Sasaki.

76
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,710
I hope I'm not much trouble.

77
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,420
Thank you for having me.

78
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,725
Our pleasure.

79
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,435
Auntie?

80
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,270
She means Yoriko.

81
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,661
Get on in.

82
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:42,433
Sorry it's a bit of a clunker.

83
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,579
Sorry it's tight in here.

84
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,248
I don't mind at all.

85
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:57,637
This area's changed since I was last here.

86
00:06:57,657 --> 00:07:00,160
All these new shops.

87
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,133
Where we're headed is a nice, relaxing place.

88
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:08,804
But since the highway was built, people stopped coming.

89
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,991
They still haven't fixed that pothole!

90
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,121
I hear you have asthma?

91
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,205
Uh,yes.

92
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,125
The wind here will fix you up in no time.

93
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:48,166
Nice place, huh?

94
00:07:48,186 --> 00:07:50,001
Bet you'd like Auntie to see it, too.

95
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,638
What's that over there?

96
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,016
On the cliff.

97
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:56,592
Oh, that's a silo.

98
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:59,011
It's for storing feed for livestock.

99
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,191
Hasn't been used in decades, though.

100
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,986
Now the village kids use it for dares.

101
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,989
They say there are ghosts there.

102
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,991
Dear, please!

103
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,660
He loves stories like that.

104
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,787
Best to stay away from there.

105
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,045
Look, that's our house over there.

106
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,261
Here, mind taking this in?

107
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,513
What's this?

108
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:36,016
Why would you accept this?

109
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,686
It's too much for us to eat.

110
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,524
He's always accepting gifts without thinking...

111
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,695
Our kids are all grown up and moved out.

112
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,572
Make yourself at home.

113
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,490
Thank you.

114
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,451
Let's see, these go where...

115
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,537
Excuse me.

116
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,757
You must think it's an odd house.

117
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,093
No, it's a lovely home.

118
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,472
No need for flattery.

119
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,977
Your room's upstairs.

120
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,438
It was my daughter's room.

121
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:30,320
It'd be sad to clear everything, so I left it as it was.

122
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,281
I see.

123
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,909
She's a yoga teacher in Tokyo now.

124
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,745
I'm thinking of trying it myself.

125
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:43,750
Oh, and feel free to use the closet and shelves.

126
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,419
Oh, thank you.

127
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:56,725
“Write me how things are, whatever you please.

128
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:59,575
Yoriko” Postcards, how quaint!

129
00:09:59,595 --> 00:10:02,425
You should write her.

130
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,646
Come here for a sec!

131
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,273
Corning!

132
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,942
He can be so pushy.

133
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,652
See you later.

134
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,493
Smells like a stranger's house.

135
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,570
Feels nice.

136
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,323
I've arrived safely.

137
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,533
It's quite nice here.

138
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:00,651
Mr. and Mrs.

139
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:02,153
Oiwa are both very kind.

140
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:17,844
To Yoriko Sasaki These are delicious.

141
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,014
Sorry, my hands are full.

142
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,850
Um, I'm going to the post office.

143
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,520
Sure, go on.

144
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:27,979
Won't you try this?

145
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,564
Later.

146
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,067
Okay, I'll save it for dessert.

147
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,870
By the way, there's a shortcut by the parking lot.

148
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,038
Oh, thank you.

149
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:53,255
SHORTCUT This is the shortcut?

150
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,915
Boys just drive me mad!

151
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,834
It's tough being class president.

152
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,545
Wait, I need to drop off a letter.

153
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,554
Hey, who's that?

154
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,334
Why is it...

155
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,464
That mansion feels familiar.

156
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,998
I wonder if anyone lives here.

157
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,756
Excuse me...

158
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,357
What a big house.

159
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,933
I guess there's no one here.

160
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,515
Oh, no...

161
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,290
Thank you.

162
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,363
He's a bear.

163
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:19,885
Or maybe a sea lion.

164
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,884
Sounds like an adventure!

165
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,430
Completely different in high tide, isn't it?

166
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,890
It's the power of the moon.

167
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,270
But imagine that, Toichi giving a girl a ride on his boat.

168
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:02,617
He's actually a good guy.

169
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:04,849
Just not much of a talker.

170
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,904
You should ask him for a ride again.

171
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,615
Ask him for a ride.

172
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:15,744
I Will.

173
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,790
But it's best you stay away from The Marsh House.

174
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,210
How come?

175
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,671
Ghosts.

176
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,505
Not again!

177
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,967
I'll get some wine.

178
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,887
Looked like no one lives there.

179
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,597
Not now, anyway.

180
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,435
Used to be a vacation home for some foreigners.

181
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,813
Then it changed hands a few times.

182
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,900
But it's been vacant for a while now.

183
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,611
I see...

184
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,015
Someone's there.

185
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,518
Have you finished them yet?

186
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:05,677
What Mrs.

187
00:19:05,697 --> 00:19:06,678
Kadoya asked for.

188
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:07,637
Oh...

189
00:19:07,657 --> 00:19:08,346
Almost done.

190
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:09,931
Hey, Anna.

191
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,849
Going out?

192
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,193
Yes.

193
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,863
Just finish them already...

194
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,366
I'm going to go sketch.

195
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:19,868
Sure, go on.

196
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,035
Thank you.

197
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:30,211
Yoriko was worried about her, but she looks fine to me.

198
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,715
As long as she's having fun and eating well.

199
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:35,550
That's for sure.

200
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:43,391
All the trash you pick up will be collected here.

201
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,894
Everyone listen!

202
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,395
Now begin!

203
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,567
Look, it's Toichi.

204
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:53,985
Toichi the mute!

205
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,405
Toichi who only talks once a decade!

206
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,909
Hey, I said we're not going there until later!

207
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,077
We're just checking it out!

208
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,287
See ya!

209
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,582
Perhaps we'll hear from you next time!

210
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,978
I'm going out.

211
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,313
Wait, Anna.

212
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,986
I have a little errand, so hold on.

213
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:21,656
Yes.

214
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,161
He should be delivering these himself.

215
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,164
“I'm allergic to that lady,” he says!

216
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:32,282
But Mrs.

217
00:21:32,302 --> 00:21:33,742
Kadoya's been wanting to meet you.

218
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,839
Their daughter Nobuko is a year older than you.

219
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,678
Nobuko is at cram school today.

220
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,680
Oh, that's too bad.

221
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:47,297
This must be Anna.

222
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:48,757
Nice to meet you.

223
00:21:50,528 --> 00:21:51,760
Oh, um...

224
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,012
Hello.

225
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,024
Ah, so you draw, I see?

226
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,692
Show me next time.

227
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,819
No, I'm not very good.

228
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:06,284
Oh, you should go to the Tanabata Festival with Nobuko tomorrow.

229
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,296
Great idea!

230
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:10,193
I should still have my daughter's yukata.

231
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:13,207
You can wear it to the festival.

232
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,043
But...

233
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:17,545
Yes.

234
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:19,204
I'll let Nobuko know.

235
00:22:19,224 --> 00:22:20,539
Now come in.

236
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,508
Where'd I put it...

237
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,552
Uh, actually I...

238
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:26,169
Oh, you're going sketching.

239
00:22:26,189 --> 00:22:27,546
Go ahead!

240
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:31,893
She'll look great!

241
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,062
Ready,and“.

242
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:35,219
- This one, too.

243
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,220
- Got it.

244
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,566
I won't look good in it.

245
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,402
None of her business.

246
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,249
He's not here.

247
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:24,143
- Bye.

248
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:25,269
- See you tomorrow.

249
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,311
The tide is out.

250
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,002
Again.

251
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,513
I hate festivals.

252
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,023
Hey, let's go.

253
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,524
Wait for me.

254
00:24:44,035 --> 00:24:45,162
- Here you go.

255
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:46,309
- Thank you.

256
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:47,476
- Here's some candy.

257
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:48,518
- Thanks.

258
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:53,367
I wish I was wearing a yukata, too.

259
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,369
At least you're comfortable.

260
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:56,903
Mom forces her tastes on me.

261
00:24:56,923 --> 00:24:58,280
It's awful.

262
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,208
I think it looks cute.

263
00:25:00,384 --> 00:25:01,199
What?

264
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:02,034
No way!

265
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,213
It's boring and tacky...

266
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,049
So Anna, where are you from?

267
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:09,884
From Sapporo.

268
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:13,221
Cool, I bet the city has great shopping.

269
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,389
Maybe lots of cute boys, too?

270
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,225
You be quiet.

271
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,392
Sure, sure.

272
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,395
Not much to choose from here in the boonies.

273
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,398
Why'd you come out here?

274
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,400
Well...

275
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:27,892
What's this?

276
00:25:27,912 --> 00:25:29,227
Nobuko!

277
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,363
What is it?

278
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,909
He's always making the same mistakes.

279
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:37,078
I'll warn him next time.

280
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:45,378
There it is.

281
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:47,004
Will my wish come true?

282
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:50,091
Can I have a candle?

283
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,717
Here you go.

284
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,770
Write your wish on this.

285
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,441
My wish...

286
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,779
Ow!

287
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,948
Sorry about that.

288
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:18,327
Anna!

289
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:20,465
Hey, where were you?

290
00:26:20,485 --> 00:26:22,321
I was looking for you.

291
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,458
Oh, your wish.

292
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:26,294
Let's see...

293
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:32,300
“I wish for a normal life everyday.” “Normal”?

294
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,136
Anna, what do you mean by normal?

295
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:36,345
Uh, well...

296
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:37,930
You see, urn...

297
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,849
Hey, your eye color!

298
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:41,809
What?

299
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:44,103
It's really pretty.

300
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,980
It's a bit blue, like a foreign...

301
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:47,648
Leave me alone!

302
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,568
You fat Pig!

303
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:54,488
Fat...

304
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,481
Uh...

305
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:58,482
I mean...

306
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,663
I see what you mean by normal.

307
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:08,002
But there's no use pretending to be normal.

308
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:12,006
After all, you look like just what you are.

309
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,345
Okay, now let's drop it.

310
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,680
You should join us next...

311
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:22,516
Anna!

312
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:24,518
Hey, watch it!

313
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,697
Like just what I am...

314
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,141
Like just what I am...

315
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:12,024
UQ/V, Stupid, moody, unpleasant...

316
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:15,569
That's why...

317
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,073
I hate myself.

318
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,244
That's why everyone...

319
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:28,114
We don't have long to live.

320
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:30,575
Typically, you're the ones who...

321
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,753
Still talking about that?

322
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,548
We already settled this matter.

323
00:28:35,683 --> 00:28:36,956
We're not blaming you.

324
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:38,249
It's just that...

325
00:28:38,436 --> 00:28:40,001
I've already told you.

326
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:41,586
It's not about money.

327
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,264
I feel bad for her, but...

328
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:46,100
It'll be best for her if you two...

329
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,288
I'd better get home.

330
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,482
Did someone row it here?

331
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,208
It's stuck!

332
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:42,550
Throw me the rope!

333
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,218
The rope?

334
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:48,556
Hurry!

335
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,255
Are you okay?

336
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,207
Yeah.

337
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:25,584
Oh, urn...

338
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,263
Are you a real person?

339
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,432
Don't let anyone hear.

340
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,436
You look like the girl I saw in my dreams.

341
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,271
Dreams?

342
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:52,953
Thanks.

343
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,792
It's not a dream.

344
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,468
What's your name?

345
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:08,969
Anna.

346
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:12,222
I'm desperate to get to know you.

347
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,974
What about you?

348
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,143
Yes.

349
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,772
Have you seen me before?

350
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:21,815
Yes.

351
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,484
Often.

352
00:32:24,495 --> 00:32:26,561
I just got here.

353
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:28,647
How long have you been here?

354
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,824
I've been here for ages...

355
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,717
Look at this, the marsh at night.

356
00:32:49,186 --> 00:32:51,335
How beautiful.

357
00:32:51,355 --> 00:32:53,504
Say, let's go down for a closer look.

358
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:54,598
Madam.

359
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,017
I know.

360
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:00,521
By the way, where's that child?

361
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:03,023
Was she not in her room?

362
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,529
I need to get back.

363
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:10,656
Were they talking about you?

364
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:11,699
Yes.

365
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:16,537
Usually I'm in bed by this hour.

366
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,542
Come on, I'll row you back.

367
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,294
So it was your boat.

368
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:27,715
Yes, I left it for you on purpose.

369
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:34,555
But I thought you'd row a little better.

370
00:33:37,151 --> 00:33:38,591
I know.

371
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:40,051
So did I.

372
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:45,065
You're my precious secret.

373
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,695
I haven't told anyone about you, and I won't.

374
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:53,657
If someone finds out, they'll only spoil it.

375
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,584
Please, promise me.

376
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,420
That we'll remain a secret.

377
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,255
Forever.

378
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:10,758
Yes.

379
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:13,719
It'll be our secret.

380
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,012
Forever.

381
00:34:57,815 --> 00:34:59,714
It was awful.

382
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:01,633
She came home crying her eyes out!

383
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,144
Did Anna do something?

384
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,980
She called my daughter a fat pig!

385
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,982
Fat Pig?

386
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,830
And she pulled out a cutter, too.

387
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,770
The horror!

388
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:14,863
I doubt she'd...

389
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,991
No, you need to hear it from the girl herself.

390
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,868
Now bring her here.

391
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,996
Seems she's not home yet.

392
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,835
She's a delinquent, out and about this late!

393
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,004
You two are at fault, too!

394
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,007
Better keep an eye on her.

395
00:35:37,855 --> 00:35:38,502
Take this.

396
00:35:38,522 --> 00:35:39,169
It's dark.

397
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,681
No, thank you.

398
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,687
What if something happens to one of the kids?

399
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,024
So what if she's a bit late!

400
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,693
Don't get so riled up.

401
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,028
She is not a delinquent.

402
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,031
Ah, she's home.

403
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:00,200
Anna.

404
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:02,369
Aunt Oiwa...

405
00:36:02,546 --> 00:36:04,173
Were you listening?

406
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:05,820
Don't you worry.

407
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,543
You two'll make up.

408
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:12,880
Now take a bath and have dinner.

409
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:13,881
Thank you.

410
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:17,050
Or is it dinner before the bath?

411
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:19,219
It hardly matters.

412
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,723
But “fat pig” is a bit harsh.

413
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:25,726
That's for sure.

414
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,561
It's not that funny.

415
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:48,081
Auntie, worrying like always.

416
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:53,556
Anna!

417
00:36:53,576 --> 00:36:54,786
Watermelon!

418
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:01,720
Anna?

419
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,726
Two hours until high tide...

420
00:37:52,114 --> 00:37:53,116
Hop in.

421
00:37:53,136 --> 00:37:54,138
Time for a picnic.

422
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,608
I brought juice and cookies.

423
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,434
Picnic?

424
00:37:58,454 --> 00:37:59,769
At this hour?

425
00:37:59,955 --> 00:38:01,353
That's right.

426
00:38:01,373 --> 00:38:02,771
Let's go across the marsh.

427
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,546
You're very good at rowing.

428
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,508
You need rowing lessons.

429
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,884
Come here.

430
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:28,974
It's easy.

431
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:41,194
Remember I said last night that you're my precious secret?

432
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:44,834
I remember.

433
00:38:44,854 --> 00:38:46,523
And you're my secret.

434
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,327
I'm glad.

435
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,204
Hey!

436
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,004
Good, you're doing well.

437
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:06,386
But I don't even know your name yet.

438
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,558
I hadn't told you?

439
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,602
Marnie.

440
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,854
I thought you already knew.

441
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,191
That's dangerous.

442
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,494
Go ahead, just row.

443
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:50,889
There's so much I want to know about you.

444
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,059
But I want to find out slowly.

445
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,562
Slowly, by myself, as we go along.

446
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,064
Okay.

447
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,733
I'll tell you what we'll do.

448
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:06,947
We'll ask each other three questions a night.

449
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:07,948
Great.

450
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,575
All right, I'll start.

451
00:40:10,877 --> 00:40:12,713
Question one.

452
00:40:12,733 --> 00:40:14,569
Why are you here in this village?

453
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,499
I have asthma.

454
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:22,587
The doctor said I should go somewhere with clean air for a while.

455
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,132
Even by skipping school.

456
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,758
Oh no, you're ill?

457
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,635
If there's no attack, I'm fine.

458
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:33,265
So I'm staying here with Auntie's relatives, the Oiwas.

459
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:34,641
Who's Auntie?

460
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,643
It's my turn to ask now.

461
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:39,521
Do you live in that mansion?

462
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,232
Ever since I was two.

463
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,443
With Nan and the maids.

464
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:46,445
It's juice.

465
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,448
Where are your parents?

466
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,211
They only come here sometimes.

467
00:40:52,231 --> 00:40:54,109
They're busy with work.

468
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,454
I see.

469
00:40:55,755 --> 00:40:57,174
Question two.

470
00:40:57,194 --> 00:40:58,613
Who's Auntie?

471
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:01,543
My guardian.

472
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:07,466
But I was a worry to her, so she got rid of me for a while.

473
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,009
What do you mean?

474
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,303
I'll explain sometime.

475
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,513
It's my turn now.

476
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:15,849
Do you have siblings?

477
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,476
I'm an only child.

478
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:19,311
I see, you too...

479
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:20,520
How come?

480
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,690
Oh, it's nothing.

481
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:27,652
Just curious what it's like to have siblings.

482
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,656
I know, it'd be fun to imagine that.

483
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,700
All right, question three.

484
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:36,870
What's it like living at the Oiwas?

485
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:38,705
At the Oiwas?

486
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,084
Huh...

487
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:45,504
How strange...

488
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,839
I can't...

489
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:50,175
remember...

490
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,963
Marnie?

491
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:32,717
Marnie!

492
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:33,969
Anna!

493
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:38,254
There you are.

494
00:42:38,274 --> 00:42:40,089
I wondered where you went.

495
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,437
Marnie?

496
00:42:49,744 --> 00:42:51,684
I looked all over for you.

497
00:42:51,704 --> 00:42:53,644
You just disappeared.

498
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,907
I didn't go anywhere.

499
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,618
I was just trying to answer your question.

500
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,996
Wait...

501
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,081
What was it?

502
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,251
It's okay, it doesn't matter.

503
00:43:06,428 --> 00:43:07,575
I need to go soon.

504
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:08,742
Today is...

505
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,049
Oh, I know!

506
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:16,960
No no no, I really can't!

507
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,171
Parties aren't really my...

508
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:20,599
Don't worry.

509
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:23,602
I have a great idea.

510
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,305
It's true.

511
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,098
That's hard to believe.

512
00:44:14,829 --> 00:44:16,895
Sorry, did you wait long?

513
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:18,981
I had trouble getting away.

514
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:20,825
Marnie.

515
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:23,328
What do you think?

516
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:25,830
It's pretty.

517
00:44:26,675 --> 00:44:28,677
I borrowed Nan's shawl.

518
00:44:28,697 --> 00:44:30,699
I'll be scolded again.

519
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:32,545
This won't work.

520
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,507
Don't worry, I spoke to Father.

521
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,348
Young lady.

522
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,352
I believe it is past your bedtime.

523
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,021
And who might this be?

524
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:54,567
She is wearing my shawl.

525
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:57,529
Upstairs!

526
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,365
Wait right there!

527
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:17,048
You must be up to no good again.

528
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,050
You go that way.

529
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:24,055
Marnie!

530
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:26,558
Why you little...

531
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:38,935
Marnie!

532
00:45:38,955 --> 00:45:40,311
Open it!

533
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:41,281
Let's go.

534
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:45,910
If you keep this up, you'll grow up to be a lousy adult!

535
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,880
Everyone, we have a lovely flower girl here.

536
00:45:57,756 --> 00:45:59,257
A guest of my daughter.

537
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:00,800
Ah, a flower girl.

538
00:46:01,102 --> 00:46:02,751
- There's Marnie.

539
00:46:02,771 --> 00:46:04,420
- She'll be pretty like her mother.

540
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:07,974
May I please have one of those flowers?

541
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:10,602
My mother.

542
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,946
Hello, dear little witch.

543
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,950
That woman there's the real witch.

544
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:38,713
I want only one, for good luck.

545
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:43,301
Will someone kindly pay for my flower?

546
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,306
If it is the witch's command...

547
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:50,683
Then I'll have one, too.

548
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:52,384
- Here.

549
00:46:52,404 --> 00:46:53,469
- For superb luck.

550
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:58,817
Ah, it's begun.

551
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:05,156
I'm sorry!

552
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,366
Oh, she ran away.

553
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:25,218
Come take one for luck!

554
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:42,902
Young lady.

555
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,363
To your health.

556
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:49,033
Thank you.

557
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,221
Wine?

558
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,484
Awake now?

559
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:27,113
I...

560
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:29,908
Drunkard.

561
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:34,913
Who was that?

562
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:36,456
Which one?

563
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,124
The one dancing with you.

564
00:48:39,093 --> 00:48:40,679
You mean Kazuhiko?

565
00:48:40,699 --> 00:48:42,285
An old friend.

566
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,757
He's a good dancer.

567
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,009
So are you.

568
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,974
Now let's dance, you and I.

569
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,105
I can't dance.

570
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,107
Just follow my lead.

571
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,500
Look for me again.

572
00:50:03,886 --> 00:50:05,513
And don't tell anyone.

573
00:50:05,533 --> 00:50:07,160
Promise.

574
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,214
I know.

575
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:13,553
Hey, wait...

576
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,032
Is that...?

577
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:41,080
It's the girl with the Oiwas.

578
00:51:11,245 --> 00:51:12,727
I see.

579
00:51:12,747 --> 00:51:14,229
Hope you find the other shoe.

580
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:16,908
It must be somewhere.

581
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,910
I'll go look.

582
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,287
Used to always lose mine.

583
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:25,083
There's a bunch buried in the mud flats.

584
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,085
Don't compare her to you.

585
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,421
I should have my daughter's old shoes.

586
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:32,298
I'll get them out.

587
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:34,425
Thank you.

588
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:53,945
Marnie...

589
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:30,481
Wow.

590
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:35,862
Not only are they big, they're delicious, too.

591
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:54,714
You're good with the knife.

592
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:57,466
Auntie teaches me all the time.

593
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:01,554
You're so polite and well-behaved.

594
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:04,348
My daughter could learn from you.

595
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,185
Passing behind you.

596
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:11,606
I remember when you first came to Yoriko's place.

597
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,192
She was ecstatic.

598
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:21,199
She wanted to make up for the five years she didn't have with you.

599
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:26,913
So she taught you things, like knife skills.

600
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:33,377
But she worries too much.

601
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:37,048
Always calling me for help.

602
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:40,551
When I told her I was busy, she started pouting.

603
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,262
Oh, I shouldn't share this about your mother.

604
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:46,557
No, I understand.

605
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:51,270
You know, Yoriko sent us tons of photos of you.

606
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,606
I'll show you later.

607
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:58,236
Hey, look.

608
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:02,281
Found the wind chime I made on our honeymoon.

609
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,910
To survive the summer.

610
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,414
Your hair's getting long.

611
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,959
Shall I give you a haircut?

612
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,253
That would be a disaster.

613
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,448
Mar... nie...?

614
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:46,993
Look for me again.

615
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,502
How could I nearly forget about Marnie?

616
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:14,478
Marnie...

617
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,526
Marnie!

618
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:27,491
Marnie...

619
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:06,906
May I?

620
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,034
Sure.

621
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,953
I see you draw, too.

622
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:16,374
That girl looks like someone I knew.

623
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,250
She was a great girl.

624
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:21,921
Yes, she is.

625
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,966
But I haven't seen her in a week.

626
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:31,222
I wonder if she's upset that I forgot.

627
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,893
If she's a friend, talk to her and you'll be fine.

628
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:39,730
Say, will you take a look?

629
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:41,232
Sure.

630
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,118
Are the colors too messy?

631
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:54,412
No, it's wonderful.

632
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,455
I'm Hisako.

633
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,489
I'm in love with The Marsh House.

634
00:56:58,509 --> 00:57:00,408
What about you?

635
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,014
I'm Anna.

636
00:57:03,034 --> 00:57:04,328
I love it, too.

637
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:14,432
Better hurry and finish your drawing...

638
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,934
before the new folks move in.

639
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:19,270
The renovations are under way.

640
00:57:23,117 --> 00:57:24,682
Thanks for your hard work.

641
00:57:24,702 --> 00:57:26,267
Have some tea.

642
00:57:26,454 --> 00:57:27,769
Oh, thank you.

643
00:57:27,789 --> 00:57:29,104
Appreciate it.

644
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,491
Hey, let's take a break!

645
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,452
All right, coming.

646
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,132
Are you Marnie?

647
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,222
Come.

648
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,323
I hadn't seen the front before.

649
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,576
It's a lot cleaner now, but not done yet.

650
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:19,246
Hello.

651
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:20,706
Hey there.

652
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,833
Brought a friend, huh?

653
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,170
Choose your slippers.

654
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,047
A Quest?

655
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:29,215
Yeah, a secret one.

656
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:30,716
Secret?

657
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,343
Hey!

658
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:35,179
Sorry, make yourself at home.

659
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,182
Thank you.

660
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:45,022
Yes, it's a lovely place.

661
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:48,567
Yes, we're still in the middle of renovation.

662
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,528
This room...

663
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,032
Upstairs.

664
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,786
This hasn't been renovated yet.

665
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,042
Here, this is my room.

666
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,088
Really...

667
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:14,718
What do you think?

668
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,429
It's a cute room.

669
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:21,725
It used to be your room, right?

670
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:24,395
You're...

671
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:26,564
Marnie, right?

672
00:59:27,074 --> 00:59:28,472
Me?

673
00:59:28,492 --> 00:59:29,890
No, no!

674
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,779
But... then why have you been staring at my room?

675
00:59:33,946 --> 00:59:34,655
Because“.

676
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,908
See, that's where I always see you.

677
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,828
I've seen you many times.

678
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:43,914
No, no.

679
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,251
I just love this mansion, that's all.

680
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:48,544
That can't be.

681
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:52,923
When I said Marnie earlier, you were surprised.

682
00:59:53,132 --> 00:59:56,010
Rather, why do you know Marnie?

683
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,808
I found it behind the shelf.

684
01:00:04,602 --> 01:00:05,769
A diary?

685
01:00:05,904 --> 01:00:07,156
That's right.

686
01:00:07,176 --> 01:00:08,428
Your diary.

687
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,615
Marnie!

688
01:00:19,617 --> 01:00:23,162
I'll pour you some Queen Mary, your favorite.

689
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,539
I'll be back.

690
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:41,889
“Last night I went for a row in my nightie.” “The marsh and the moon were very pretty at night.” I shall do it again.

691
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:45,945
June 8th.

692
01:00:45,965 --> 01:00:47,300
A party!

693
01:00:48,197 --> 01:00:50,659
Father, Mother and many of their friends came.

694
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:53,141
It was such fun.

695
01:00:55,027 --> 01:01:01,033
I went outside from the sunroom and danced with a flower girl.

696
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:04,411
But...

697
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:09,667
Nan locked me in my room because of last night.

698
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:14,880
So there won't be any midnight rows for a bit.

699
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:25,182
See, it's you, isn't it?

700
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:28,686
No.

701
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:30,729
Marnie is...

702
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,856
Marnie is...

703
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:36,568
someone I made up.

704
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:41,365
An imaginary girl, only in my mind.

705
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,577
But this is Marnie's diary.

706
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:49,873
It's as if she really lived here.

707
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:54,920
So you're not Marnie?

708
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:55,879
No.

709
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,881
She's just imaginary?

710
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,091
That's right.

711
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:05,264
I thought you were Marnie, back for her diary...

712
01:02:09,403 --> 01:02:11,052
I'm Anna.

713
01:02:11,072 --> 01:02:12,721
I came from Sapporo to get better.

714
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:15,315
I'm Sayaka.

715
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,110
I'm from Tokyo.

716
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:24,074
But if she was imaginary, why is her name the same?

717
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:26,493
I don't know.

718
01:02:26,962 --> 01:02:29,194
Marnie must be real.

719
01:02:29,214 --> 01:02:31,446
I'm going to investigate.

720
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:47,765
Say, Marnie...

721
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:52,311
Who are you?

722
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:15,292
Is that me?

723
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:24,718
Marnie?

724
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:26,470
Marnie!

725
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:42,277
Wait, that one's not done yet...

726
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,280
Wow, you draw well.

727
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,157
Oh, thanks...

728
01:03:47,334 --> 01:03:49,650
I've never had anyone draw me before.

729
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:51,986
How nice!

730
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:01,922
I missed you.

731
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,344
I kept calling you in my heart.

732
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:12,808
Me, too.

733
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,184
Let's go.

734
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,561
Come to my room.

735
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:19,565
Come to my room, Marnie.

736
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,737
I can't go far from the mansion.

737
01:04:27,823 --> 01:04:32,077
Okay then, we'll go wherever you want.

738
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,817
You know a lot about mushrooms.

739
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:07,738
Father taught me when I was little.

740
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:11,575
I once brought home three bags full of mushrooms.

741
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:15,412
The look on Mother's face!

742
01:05:24,139 --> 01:05:25,766
What's wrong?

743
01:05:25,786 --> 01:05:27,413
So quiet all of a sudden.

744
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:31,595
You're very lucky.

745
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:34,932
I wish I was you.

746
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,068
Talk to me.

747
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,447
I'm...

748
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:53,867
a foster child.

749
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:59,665
My real parents died when I was little.

750
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,792
My grandmother, too.

751
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:06,046
I know they didn't die on purpose, but...

752
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:08,548
sometimes I feel like...

753
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:11,301
I can't forgive them...

754
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:14,346
for leaving me all alone.

755
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:20,811
I'm jealous of you.

756
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,647
You're lucky to be a foster child.

757
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:33,865
If you had no relatives, then the folks who took you in as a daughter must be truly kindhearted people.

758
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,671
Then I'll tell you a big secret.

759
01:06:49,057 --> 01:06:51,810
It's about my foster parents.

760
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:54,583
They're good to me and they're kind.

761
01:06:55,554 --> 01:07:00,434
I'm not their real child, yet they raised me, which I appreciate.

762
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:05,522
But you see, I saw it one day.

763
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:09,067
They're paid money for it.

764
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,695
Money?

765
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:14,614
I found a letter from the government.

766
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:20,871
It said they were increasing the subsidy for me.

767
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:24,458
I'm sure there's a reason...

768
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:26,418
I don't care!

769
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:33,008
They wouldn't get money if I were their real child.

770
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:38,388
They get paid because I'm not their real child.

771
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:46,104
Even worse... they hide it from me.

772
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,232
I see.

773
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:54,654
But that doesn't mean Auntie doesn't love you.

774
01:07:54,956 --> 01:07:56,166
No!

775
01:07:56,186 --> 01:07:57,396
Don't you see?

776
01:07:57,584 --> 01:07:59,607
None of the other families receive money.

777
01:07:59,627 --> 01:08:01,650
Just us!

778
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:07,250
She always looks worried that I might find out.

779
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:11,296
And I hate myself for thinking like this.

780
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:15,175
I... just can't... believe...

781
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:17,427
in anything anymore.

782
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:30,273
Anna, it's okay to cry.

783
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,442
Just know that I love you.

784
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:38,824
I love you more than any girl I've ever known.

785
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:44,663
Then you tell me your secret next.

786
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:52,129
It was long ago that I went mushrooming with Father.

787
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:56,508
Nowadays, I hardly see my parents.

788
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,220
Mother's usually travelling.

789
01:09:05,267 --> 01:09:08,812
Because of Work, Father's home only twice a year.

790
01:09:10,272 --> 01:09:14,651
Usually, Nan and the twin maids are the only ones home.

791
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:16,987
And me.

792
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:21,158
I slip out while they're gossiping.

793
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:25,579
And look how free I get to be!

794
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:32,169
It's lovely when my parents come home.

795
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:34,504
They host parties!

796
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,549
Like the other day.

797
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:44,764
With my amazing parents and many people there, it's delightful.

798
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:49,060
I get to wear new dresses and dance, too.

799
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:55,734
That's when I'm sure I'm the luckiest girl in the world.

800
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:58,445
I see.

801
01:10:08,715 --> 01:10:11,010
Tell me, Anna.

802
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:13,325
Will you be my friend forever?

803
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:14,920
Yes.

804
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:16,880
I'm your friend forever.

805
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:19,758
Right?

806
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,555
Nan's always in a bad mood.

807
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:30,393
She yanks me by the arm, brushes my hair very hard...

808
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,563
No one thinks I'm being bullied.

809
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,066
But it really hurts.

810
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:38,235
Enough to cry.

811
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:43,281
The maids love to frighten me.

812
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,952
They threatened me all the time.

813
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:53,708
“Naughty kids get shut in the silo “where ghosts suck out their souls,” they said.

814
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,587
You mean, the silo on the hill?

815
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:01,091
Once, they actually took me there.

816
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:02,842
No!

817
01:11:02,968 --> 01:11:05,971
They dragged me all the way to the silo.

818
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:08,139
I thought I'd die of fright.

819
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:14,604
Then suddenly, just as we got there, the sky went dark and the thunder came.

820
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:21,152
The maids were terrified, so we didn't go inside.

821
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:25,740
I can endure anything else.

822
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,619
Anything but the silo.

823
01:11:30,412 --> 01:11:33,290
I never heard such a terrible thing!

824
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:36,668
I hope the maids and Nan get struck by lightning!

825
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:42,757
Hasn't anyone ever tried to frighten you?

826
01:11:43,351 --> 01:11:44,749
Never.

827
01:11:44,769 --> 01:11:46,167
Definitely not on purpose.

828
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:49,681
You're lucky.

829
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:53,059
I wish I was you.

830
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,188
Our castle...

831
01:12:00,275 --> 01:12:01,985
Poor Marnie.

832
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:05,071
I love you the most, too.

833
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:07,490
More than anyone I've known.

834
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:11,244
Thank you.

835
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:20,712
Funny, it's like we traded places.

836
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:23,006
How true.

837
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:31,931
The tide's coming in.

838
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:36,186
Hey, let's go to the silo together.

839
01:12:37,697 --> 01:12:39,512
The ghosts must be a lie.

840
01:12:39,532 --> 01:12:41,347
Let's go make sure.

841
01:12:42,494 --> 01:12:44,079
Tomorrow...

842
01:12:44,099 --> 01:12:45,684
No, let's go right now.

843
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:55,330
I don't care who Marnie really is.

844
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:59,793
I just want to help her.

845
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:13,431
Are you okay, Marnie?

846
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:17,977
Yes, I'm sure I'll be all right if I'm with you...

847
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:19,729
Kazuhiko.

848
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:31,282
Anna!

849
01:13:32,085 --> 01:13:33,587
Perfect timing!

850
01:13:33,607 --> 01:13:35,109
I found it!

851
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:46,642
The rest of the diary.

852
01:13:46,662 --> 01:13:48,164
Come to my place.

853
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:49,968
Marnie...

854
01:13:51,354 --> 01:13:52,711
I'm sorry.

855
01:13:52,731 --> 01:13:54,088
Another time.

856
01:13:54,607 --> 01:13:55,880
What?

857
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,173
But it's a major discovery...

858
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:00,770
It's going to rain!

859
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:56,034
Who is it?

860
01:14:58,453 --> 01:14:59,871
Is someone there?

861
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:01,539
Marnie!

862
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,535
So you did go ahead.

863
01:15:07,555 --> 01:15:09,370
Don't scare me like that.

864
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:13,343
Marnie.

865
01:15:17,482 --> 01:15:18,421
Are you okay?

866
01:15:18,441 --> 01:15:19,380
Why did you...

867
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:20,517
Kazuhiko!

868
01:15:21,736 --> 01:15:23,385
I'm frightened.

869
01:15:23,405 --> 01:15:25,054
I heard somebody below.

870
01:15:25,907 --> 01:15:27,430
I thought I'd die of fright.

871
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:28,973
Kazuhiko...

872
01:15:29,911 --> 01:15:31,309
What're you saying?

873
01:15:31,329 --> 01:15:32,727
I'm Anna.

874
01:15:32,747 --> 01:15:34,145
Pull yourself together.

875
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:35,500
Anna...

876
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,730
Anna!

877
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:39,744
I don't want to be humiliated.

878
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:41,412
But I haven't the courage.

879
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:42,747
Oh, Anna...

880
01:15:44,008 --> 01:15:45,365
You do have courage.

881
01:15:45,385 --> 01:15:46,742
You came here.

882
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:50,088
Let's go home.

883
01:16:04,269 --> 01:16:05,436
Wait!

884
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:10,682
It's just the wind.

885
01:16:10,702 --> 01:16:11,934
Let's go.

886
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:14,612
We'll go home together.

887
01:16:33,965 --> 01:16:36,050
Anna, come back here.

888
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:37,468
Anna!

889
01:16:38,354 --> 01:16:39,898
We made it up.

890
01:16:39,918 --> 01:16:41,462
I'm sure we can make it down.

891
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:44,809
I'll go first, so follow me.

892
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:49,480
No, don't leave me!

893
01:16:58,656 --> 01:16:59,490
No!

894
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:04,162
Marnie!

895
01:17:06,164 --> 01:17:07,999
Let's go over there.

896
01:17:21,522 --> 01:17:22,754
I'm cold...

897
01:17:22,774 --> 01:17:24,006
So cold...

898
01:17:27,779 --> 01:17:29,886
Oh Anna, I'm scared...

899
01:17:29,906 --> 01:17:32,013
I'm scared...

900
01:17:32,357 --> 01:17:35,693
Don't worry, we'll be fine if we're together.

901
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:39,030
You did well, Marnie.

902
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,073
Are you okay?

903
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:24,575
Kazuhiko!

904
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:27,453
I thought you'd never come.

905
01:18:28,589 --> 01:18:29,654
I...

906
01:18:29,674 --> 01:18:30,739
I...

907
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,425
Let's go home.

908
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:06,451
Marnie?

909
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:10,788
Marnie!

910
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:20,465
Marnie!

911
01:19:27,398 --> 01:19:29,130
Marnie...

912
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:30,882
You left me behind!

913
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,650
Even you!

914
01:20:06,103 --> 01:20:07,355
Kazuhiko...

915
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:08,627
Kazuhiko...

916
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,849
Kazuhik0's all over this diary.

917
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:19,857
“Kazuhiko is trying to take me to the silo.” Silo...

918
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,569
Yes?

919
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:26,823
Mom cooked some corn.

920
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:29,033
Hurry or it'll be gone.

921
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:29,951
Wait!

922
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:34,539
Why go out on a night like this?

923
01:20:35,373 --> 01:20:36,207
It's not safe.

924
01:20:36,384 --> 01:20:38,866
My friend might be caught in the rain.

925
01:20:38,886 --> 01:20:41,368
What if she gets pneumonia?

926
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:46,717
Is that...

927
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,970
Anna!

928
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:50,555
Are you okay?

929
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,225
So cruel...

930
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,228
Anna?

931
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,982
So cruel, Marnie...

932
01:21:01,566 --> 01:21:03,067
She has a high fever!

933
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:04,569
I'll g0 get help.

934
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:07,071
Anna.

935
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:11,409
Anna?

936
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:14,745
Anna...

937
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,587
How's she doing?

938
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:26,424
Her fever's not coming down.

939
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,428
She did get a shot earlier.

940
01:21:30,845 --> 01:21:32,263
I see.

941
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:44,942
So cruel...

942
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:50,615
Marnie, how could you?

943
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:56,954
I won't forgive you.

944
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:00,458
Leaving me behind without a word.

945
01:22:25,701 --> 01:22:27,078
Anna!

946
01:22:27,098 --> 01:22:28,475
My dear Anna!

947
01:22:30,498 --> 01:22:32,480
Marnie!

948
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,482
How could you leave me behind?

949
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:36,869
Why did you betray me?

950
01:22:37,662 --> 01:22:40,873
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to leave you all alone.

951
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:42,833
But...

952
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:48,506
But at that moment, you weren't there.

953
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,133
What do you mean?

954
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:54,345
Oh, Anna, I...

955
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:57,682
I can't stay here any longer.

956
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:01,185
I have to say goodbye to you.

957
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:06,357
So please, Anna, please say you forgive me!

958
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:12,196
Anna...

959
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,702
Of course, I forgive you!

960
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:20,538
I love you, Marnie!

961
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:23,165
And I won't forget you!

962
01:23:23,551 --> 01:23:24,886
I'll never forget you!

963
01:23:24,906 --> 01:23:26,241
Ever!

964
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,253
Anna.

965
01:24:16,302 --> 01:24:18,012
Sayaka's here for you.

966
01:24:21,474 --> 01:24:22,516
Thanks.

967
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,938
You could see her in your room.

968
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:30,441
No, it's nice outside.

969
01:24:30,785 --> 01:24:32,378
The view here is beautiful.

970
01:24:32,398 --> 01:24:33,991
I'd love to show you.

971
01:24:34,011 --> 01:24:35,604
- Anna Sayaka.

972
01:24:36,447 --> 01:24:38,115
Here, a get-well gift.

973
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:39,617
Thanks.

974
01:24:39,742 --> 01:24:40,785
Also...

975
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:47,792
This is what made me think you might be at the silo.

976
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:48,959
What is it?

977
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:52,421
The rest of the diary you promised to read.

978
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,300
I'm having trouble remembering.

979
01:24:56,467 --> 01:24:58,177
I impressed myself.

980
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:02,473
I found a clue in this painting that was behind the cupboard.

981
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,976
Maybe I'm psychic.

982
01:25:06,644 --> 01:25:08,145
Turn it over.

983
01:25:13,651 --> 01:25:15,486
Hisako!

984
01:25:18,906 --> 01:25:20,658
Hisako!

985
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:39,176
Please, will you tell us about Marnie?

986
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:40,928
But...

987
01:25:41,846 --> 01:25:43,681
it's a rather sad story.

988
01:25:44,515 --> 01:25:46,016
I'm ready for it.

989
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:53,524
It was a long time ago.

990
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:58,863
I used to play at The Marsh House often.

991
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:03,200
Marnie and I were very little.

992
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:04,535
It's a bear!

993
01:26:04,702 --> 01:26:06,036
Let me see.

994
01:26:06,505 --> 01:26:08,007
This is Daddy.

995
01:26:08,027 --> 01:26:09,529
Isn't he dashing?

996
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:16,046
Marnie loved to boast about her glamorous parents and their extravagant parties.

997
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:22,720
But the truth is, she was being neglected.

998
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,559
Goodbye, Marnie.

999
01:26:28,726 --> 01:26:30,186
That poor child...

1000
01:26:30,321 --> 01:26:32,845
No, don't leave me, Mommy!

1001
01:26:32,865 --> 01:26:35,389
Don't go!

1002
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:38,569
Seems even the maids were bullying her.

1003
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:40,571
That's awful!

1004
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:47,578
Later, Marnie moved to Sapporo and married Kazuhiko, her childhood friend.

1005
01:26:50,998 --> 01:26:57,087
With her family torn apart and feeling lost, he was there to support her.

1006
01:26:58,682 --> 01:27:00,706
I'm glad.

1007
01:27:00,726 --> 01:27:02,750
So Kazuhiko was a good man.

1008
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:07,598
Two years later, Emily was born.

1009
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:13,938
At last in the warm household she'd always wanted, Marnie was happy.

1010
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:20,110
I didn't see Marnie for many years after that.

1011
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:22,947
The next time was...

1012
01:27:23,197 --> 01:27:27,284
a few years after Kazuhiko had died of an illness.

1013
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:37,461
By then, Marnie was in a sanatorium due to the shock of his death.

1014
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,296
Sanatorium?

1015
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,424
A place where you go to get better.

1016
01:27:43,801 --> 01:27:45,970
What happened to Emily?

1017
01:27:46,637 --> 01:27:51,642
Marnie's parents had died, leaving no one to look after her.

1018
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:58,983
So for elementary school, she was sent to a boarding school.

1019
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:12,496
By the time she returned at age 73, she had become a different person.

1020
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:14,331
Emily!

1021
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:17,167
She was willful and independent.

1022
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:24,174
She knew Marnie was ill, but still resented her for sending her away.

1023
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:28,220
You think that makes you more motherly?

1024
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:31,974
I want you to live the way you wish, but...

1025
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:33,517
you need to...

1026
01:28:33,684 --> 01:28:36,854
They never did make up after that.

1027
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:37,980
As your mother...

1028
01:28:38,105 --> 01:28:41,025
I've never thought of you as a mother.

1029
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:46,363
Emily ran away and soon g0! married.

1030
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:49,700
She was expecting, you see.

1031
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,388
But...

1032
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:19,229
One day, Emily and her husband died in a car accident.

1033
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:25,152
I heard Marnie took their child in.

1034
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:32,409
She was determined to never let this child be lonely.

1035
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:35,079
But...

1036
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:39,208
she never got over losing Emily.

1037
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:44,922
She became very ill, and died the next year.

1038
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:50,260
That was about ten years ago.

1039
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:58,435
I'm sorry, it's a sad story.

1040
01:29:58,644 --> 01:30:01,271
No, thank you very much.

1041
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:05,943
Marnie adored that mansion.

1042
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:11,949
She loved seeing the marsh from her window.

1043
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:17,454
She said it felt like the birds spoke to her.

1044
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:24,461
She had a lonely life, but she lived it fully.

1045
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:28,966
Always with a smile, determined to be happy.

1046
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:33,929
So you've met Marnie, too.

1047
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:57,327
Wish we could've played more, Anna.

1048
01:30:57,661 --> 01:31:00,664
The plan was always just for the summer.

1049
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:03,500
Will you come again next summer?

1050
01:31:03,969 --> 01:31:05,137
I'm sure I will.

1051
01:31:05,157 --> 01:31:06,325
I'll write you.

1052
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:09,506
I'll write you, too.

1053
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:17,014
I put the diary and painting back where I found them.

1054
01:31:17,306 --> 01:31:19,349
Good, it's for the best.

1055
01:31:20,017 --> 01:31:21,852
I haven't told my family.

1056
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:24,521
Let's keep it our secret.

1057
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:28,859
How funny...

1058
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:33,572
Marnie brought us together.

1059
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:35,365
That's true.

1060
01:31:37,326 --> 01:31:38,368
Marnie...

1061
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:46,210
The girl trapped behind the blue window...

1062
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,546
That was long ago.

1063
01:31:54,218 --> 01:31:58,055
Exactly, he does it to save her life.

1064
01:31:58,222 --> 01:31:59,556
I love that part.

1065
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:02,726
Ah, now I want to read it all over again.

1066
01:32:03,519 --> 01:32:05,229
I'll loan you Volume 2.

1067
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:06,730
Anna!

1068
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:11,902
Auntie!

1069
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:16,073
Anna...

1070
01:32:18,242 --> 01:32:20,244
Hey, be careful!

1071
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:21,745
Sorry, sorry.

1072
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:30,587
Auntie's here.

1073
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:34,258
Ah, Yoriko, you're here.

1074
01:32:36,927 --> 01:32:38,762
Thank you for everything.

1075
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:42,266
She's doing well, and even made a friend.

1076
01:32:42,933 --> 01:32:44,601
How can I ever repay you?

1077
01:32:44,736 --> 01:32:46,656
Oh, no.

1078
01:32:46,676 --> 01:32:48,596
We didn't do anything at all.

1079
01:32:48,939 --> 01:32:50,732
Anna is a good girl.

1080
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:54,111
It was like having our own daughter back.

1081
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:56,113
She's welcome anytime.

1082
01:32:56,822 --> 01:32:57,948
Thank you.

1083
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,449
Let's talk inside.

1084
01:33:02,286 --> 01:33:05,789
I'm impressed you didn't call us this time.

1085
01:33:19,303 --> 01:33:20,971
I'm all packed.

1086
01:33:21,972 --> 01:33:22,806
Anna.

1087
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:25,309
Yes?

1088
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:30,147
There's something I need to tell you.

1089
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:36,653
We receive monthly subsidies to cover your expenses.

1090
01:33:37,154 --> 01:33:38,655
We receive money.

1091
01:33:39,156 --> 01:33:42,284
I've long hesitated to tell you, but...

1092
01:33:42,419 --> 01:33:43,587
- It's okay.

1093
01:33:43,607 --> 01:33:44,775
- But believe me...

1094
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:49,916
Whether or not we receive money, it doesn't change our love for you.

1095
01:33:51,335 --> 01:33:52,669
I already knew.

1096
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:55,672
I'm happy you told me about it.

1097
01:33:55,839 --> 01:33:56,840
Anna!

1098
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:05,182
I've been looking at the photos you sent.

1099
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:07,351
Photos?

1100
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:14,191
Oh, while you were away I was looking at old albums and found this picture.

1101
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:15,692
Do you remember?

1102
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:20,030
It's that mansion.

1103
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:23,825
When you first came, you wouldn't let it go.

1104
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:31,375
I was told at the orphanage it belonged to your grandmother.

1105
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:41,218
My beloved home - Marnie Marnie!

1106
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:22,259
So that's who she was.

1107
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:25,762
Anna.

1108
01:35:29,266 --> 01:35:33,603
And so I was in the silo all night.

1109
01:35:33,937 --> 01:35:36,440
I was very frightened.

1110
01:35:37,149 --> 01:35:39,776
That's when your grandpa came.

1111
01:35:40,444 --> 01:35:43,613
He encouraged me, saying I did well.

1112
01:35:44,281 --> 01:35:47,784
I've overcome many frightening things.

1113
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:49,786
And so will you, Anna.

1114
01:35:50,954 --> 01:35:56,960
After all, you're my one and only grandchild.

1115
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:00,964
Grandma...

1116
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:46,676
Excuse me.

1117
01:36:49,012 --> 01:36:50,013
Anna.

1118
01:36:51,515 --> 01:36:53,517
I'm sorry for what I said.

1119
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:58,188
Don't skip trash pickup next year.

1120
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:06,696
A friend?

1121
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,031
Maybe.

1122
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:16,373
Hisako!

1123
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:21,211
Anna.

1124
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:24,214
I'm going home to Sapporo now.

1125
01:37:24,381 --> 01:37:25,882
Is that right?

1126
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:30,053
But your face tells me something good happened.

1127
01:37:30,554 --> 01:37:33,390
Yes, I'm really happy now.

1128
01:37:33,682 --> 01:37:34,724
Good.

1129
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:38,061
Um, this is my mother.

1130
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:42,566
Thank you for being kind to Anna.

1131
01:37:43,108 --> 01:37:45,068
Oh no, it was my pleasure.

1132
01:37:45,694 --> 01:37:47,904
Let's draw together again.

1133
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:48,905
Yes.

1134
01:37:49,082 --> 01:37:50,647
I'll write you.

1135
01:37:50,667 --> 01:37:52,232
I have some amazing news.

1136
01:37:52,409 --> 01:37:53,243
Goodbye.

1137
01:37:55,579 --> 01:37:57,747
Thank you very much.

1138
01:38:03,169 --> 01:38:04,588
Amazing news?

1139
01:38:04,754 --> 01:38:06,923
Yeah, I'll tell you later.

1140
01:38:07,257 --> 01:38:08,758
Oh, why not now?

1141
01:38:08,925 --> 01:38:10,760
I promise I'll tell you.

1142
01:38:21,948 --> 01:38:23,318
Toichi!

1143
01:38:23,338 --> 01:38:24,708
Sayaka!

1144
01:38:24,728 --> 01:38:26,098
