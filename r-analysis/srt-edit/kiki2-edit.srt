00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:22,855
Tokuma Shoten, Yamato Transport and Nippon Television Network present Now the latest weather forecast for northwest Koriko.

2
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,317
Skies are clearing up, thanks to a high-pressure front...

3
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,529
moving in from the continent.

4
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,282
Mild winds will be blowing in from the northwest...

5
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,160
clearing out the clouds by this evening.

6
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,413
We'll also have a beautiful full moon tonight.

7
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:41,948
Tomorrow - fair.

8
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:44,158
Day after tomorrow - fair.

9
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,589
More news in just a minute.

10
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,134
First, a word from today's sponsor.

11
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:22,135
Jiji, I've decided!

12
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:23,282
I'm gonna do it tonight!

13
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,752
Mom!

14
00:01:27,973 --> 00:01:29,412
Oh, hi, Miss Dora.

15
00:01:29,432 --> 00:01:30,871
It's gonna be completely clear tonight.

16
00:01:31,268 --> 00:01:32,770
I heard the weather forecast.

17
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,292
There's gonna be a big full moon.

18
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,763
Did you borrow your father's radio without permission again?

19
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,682
It's okay, isn't it?

20
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,143
Happy to see you, Miss Dora.

21
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:43,281
Mom, my mind's made up.

22
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:44,261
It's tonight.

23
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,981
Weren't you going to put it off a month?

24
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,650
But the next full moon might be on a cloudy night.

25
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,195
I want to make sure I leave on the perfect night.

26
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,697
Kiki, wait!

27
00:01:58,754 --> 00:02:00,172
My, my.

28
00:02:00,192 --> 00:02:01,610
What's this leaving business?

29
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,498
It's one of our old customs.

30
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,710
At 13, a witch leaves home for a year of training.

31
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,504
Your little baby is 13?

32
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:12,350
My, my.

33
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,788
Time flies so quickly, doesn't it?

34
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:15,562
I'm afraid so.

35
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:17,209
But nobody leaves home that young anymore.

36
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,222
I remember perfectly well...

37
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,808
the exact day you arrived in this town.

38
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,686
A little 13-year-old girl came down from the sky...

39
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,522
riding a broomstick, her eyes shining.

40
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:33,069
I thought you were a bit full of yourself.

41
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,237
But Kiki still has much to learn.

42
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,657
She hardly knows any of my potions.

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,993
After I'm gone, who will make this medicine?

44
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,912
Sign of the times, I'm afraid.

45
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,039
Everything changes, bit by bit.

46
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:49,919
But I have to say, nothing works as well for my rheumatism.

47
00:02:51,556 --> 00:02:53,455
You're always telling me to hurry!

48
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:55,374
Now who's the slowpoke?

49
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,596
I think it's better to leave with decorum and great dignity.

50
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:05,059
If we put it off for a month, and I find some wonderful boyfriend, then what?

51
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,727
We'll never leave!

52
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:08,782
I'm worried about this.

53
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:10,470
Once you've decided, you can't go back.

54
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:11,159
Of course.

55
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:11,721
I know that.

56
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:13,370
Good.

57
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:13,932
It's there.

58
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,727
I'm so excited!

59
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:17,395
It's like getting a birthday present!

60
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,786
Dad!

61
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,497
I've decided to go away tonight!

62
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:27,558
- Tonight?

63
00:03:27,578 --> 00:03:28,419
- Yeah!

64
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,280
I just decided!

65
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,295
Well, yes, but what about our camping trip for this weekend?

66
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,339
Sorry, Dad!

67
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,843
This won't do at all!

68
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:46,494
Yes.

69
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:47,314
I'll expect you then.

70
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:48,134
Thanks.

71
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:54,244
Hi, Mom.

72
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:56,099
I wanted to make sure you knew that Kiki is leaving tonight.

73
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,319
Yes, at midnight.

74
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:04,296
- Not bad.

75
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:06,277
- I wish it were a different color.

76
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,331
Witches have always worn this color.

77
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,835
Black cat, black clothes.

78
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,671
It's not really important what color your dress is.

79
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,132
What matters is the heart inside it.

80
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,135
I know that having a good heart is very important.

81
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,888
I wish I could show you that my heart is ready.

82
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,223
Just follow that heart and keep smiling.

83
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,892
Okay.

84
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,438
Be sure to write home as soon as you've found a place.

85
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,816
Dad, can I please take the radio?

86
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,985
Mom, you said I could have his radio.

87
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:39,873
- Yea!

88
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:41,603
- Well, the radio's yours now.

89
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,501
Okay.

90
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:44,939
Now let me have a look at my little witch.

91
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,002
You look like your mother when she was young.

92
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,796
Dad...

93
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,799
would you pick me up like you used to?

94
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,217
Well...

95
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,357
How come you never told me you were growing up so fast?

96
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,652
You can always come home if things don't work out.

97
00:05:19,788 --> 00:05:21,269
Come back to my old room?

98
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:22,770
No, thanks.

99
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,118
I hope you find a good town.

100
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,050
I bet it's real tough to find a town to live in by yourself.

101
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:44,104
Don't worry.

102
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:45,042
Kiki will be fine.

103
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:46,690
- What kind of town are you looking for?

104
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,045
- A big town?

105
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:49,380
Yeah.

106
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,547
By the ocean, I hope.

107
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:52,196
- Wow!

108
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:53,718
- I'm so jealous of you!

109
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:56,700
But I'm not going for a good time.

110
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,265
I'll be in training at least a year.

111
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,485
Yeah, but they'll have discos, won't they?

112
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:06,376
- Kiki, it's almost time.

113
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:08,023
- Okay!

114
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,078
That's the broom you're leaving on?

115
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:12,153
Yeah.

116
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:13,070
I just made it.

117
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:13,987
Pretty cute, huh?

118
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:16,366
It's cute, but you can't start on a broom that's too small.

119
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:18,577
Take mine.

120
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,588
But, Mom, that one's so old.

121
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:23,331
That's why you should have it.

122
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:25,875
It never loses its way, even in a storm.

123
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,636
Kiki, trust me.

124
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:29,963
But I worked so hard on it.

125
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:31,673
Right, Jiji?

126
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,476
Your mother's broom would be better.

127
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,270
You rotten traitor.

128
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:39,263
He's right.

129
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:41,765
You can make yourself another broom when you get settled down.

130
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,700
Be careful.

131
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:50,859
- Go get 'em.

132
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,693
- Bye.

133
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:02,704
Go, go, Kiki!

134
00:07:02,724 --> 00:07:04,623
Go, go, Kiki!

135
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,479
She still hasn't got the hang of it.

136
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,448
She's well past the lake and doing just fine.

137
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,493
I'm going to miss the sound of those little bells.

138
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,585
Which way are we headed?

139
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,963
I think south, to the ocean.

140
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:51,168
Climb up and turn on the radio.

141
00:07:51,188 --> 00:07:53,461
I don't think I can.

142
00:08:03,525 --> 00:09:26,440

143
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:28,984
It was.

144
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,862
Newcomer, I suppose.

145
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:33,228
I must be.

146
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:34,353
I just left home tonight.

147
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,618
Would you mind turning off that music?

148
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,162
I prefer to fly without accompaniment.

149
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,377
Is it really hard to get settled into a place you've never been?

150
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:49,620
Oh, yes.

151
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,704
Lots can go wrong.

152
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,384
But since I'm good at fortune-telling, I can handle anything.

153
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,719
Fortunes?

154
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,514
In fact, I've started telling fortunes about love lately.

155
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,683
What's your special skill?

156
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,145
I haven't made up my mind yet.

157
00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:06,908
Uh-huh.

158
00:10:06,928 --> 00:10:08,513
Well, I'm nearly finished with my training period.

159
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,151
It'll be terrific to go home with confidence.

160
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,571
That's my town down there.

161
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,242
It's not big or terribly interesting, but I like it.

162
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:19,775
- Good luck to you.

163
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:20,817
- Thanks.

164
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,705
Goodbye!

165
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:29,890
Disgusting.

166
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,996
What a stuck-up cat.

167
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,715
I have to have a special skill.

168
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,223
What was that about good weather?

169
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,026
Don't tell me you are going to...

170
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,498
We'll sleep here until the storm's gone.

171
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:07,990
- Won't we get into trouble?

172
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,366
- Not if nobody finds us.

173
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,010
I'm soaked through.

174
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,761
Do you feel anything moving?

175
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,434
This smells great.

176
00:12:41,646 --> 00:12:43,085
Sorry.

177
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:44,544
We didn't mean to fall asleep in your breakfast.

178
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,818
Jiji, you've gotta come see the ocean.

179
00:12:57,996 --> 00:12:58,788
I don't believe it!

180
00:12:58,808 --> 00:12:59,600
It's huge!

181
00:13:00,498 --> 00:13:02,500
- It's only a puddle to me.

182
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,522
- Aw, come on.

183
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:15,660
That one's giant.

184
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,537
Think there might be other witches there?

185
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,880
How would I know?

186
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,354
Let's go!

187
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,116
You all right back there?

188
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:49,213
Look.

189
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:51,235
A big town floating on the sea.

190
00:14:19,494 --> 00:14:21,100
Just as I hoped.

191
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,726
A clock tower and everything!

192
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,655
What if there are some witches living here already?

193
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,240
There may not be.

194
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:06,854
- Am I gonna like it here!

195
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:08,814
- It's a trifle large for my taste.

196
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:10,482
Bless my hourglass!

197
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:11,983
If that ain't a witch!

198
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,080
Good morning!

199
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,541
Are there any other witches in this town?

200
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,762
No.

201
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:21,534
Can't say I've seen a single one of 'em lately.

202
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:23,100
How about that?

203
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,247
Let's settle down right here.

204
00:15:24,392 --> 00:15:25,331
- Thanks, mister!

205
00:15:25,351 --> 00:15:26,290
Bye!

206
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,249
- Don't mention it!

207
00:15:33,276 --> 00:15:34,361
- Tell me we're not landing down there.

208
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:35,466
- Of course we are.

209
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,156
Everybody's looking at us.

210
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:50,773
I know.

211
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:52,274
Smile and make a good first impression.

212
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,253
Well, you see, I'm a witch.

213
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:35,816
My name is Kiki.

214
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,579
This is my black cat Jiji.

215
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,498
We'd be honored if we could live here.

216
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:45,953
We'd love to live here.

217
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:47,871
You have a wonderful bell tower.

218
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,719
We're glad you like it, my dear.

219
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,064
Hey, kid, what were you doing jumping into the street like that?

220
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,274
You almost caused an accident.

221
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,069
You must be crazy, zooming around on a broom in public.

222
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:10,686
I'm a new witch, sir.

223
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:12,020
We're supposed to fly around.

224
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,908
You're supposed to obey the law the same as other people.

225
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,868
What's your name and address?

226
00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:19,320
- Are you gonna tell my parents?

227
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,905
- Of course, if it's necessary.

228
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:21,822
I have to.

229
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:22,572
You're a minor.

230
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,727
Thief!

231
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:24,714
Somebody stop him!

232
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:25,701
Stop, thief!

233
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,755
Don't you move from there!

234
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,363
Kiki.

235
00:17:56,836 --> 00:17:58,108
Wait up!

236
00:17:58,128 --> 00:17:59,400
It worked out pretty good, huh?

237
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:01,549
Good plan to get rid of that cop, huh?

238
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:03,363
I was the one yelling "Thief!"

239
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,749
You're a real witch, right?

240
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,377
I saw you flying.

241
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,754
Could I look at that broom?

242
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,631
Hey, Tombo!

243
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,384
Isn't it a bit early for girl hunting?

244
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,595
Hey, you guys, shut up.

245
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:22,133
Let me look at your broom.

246
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:23,134
Please?

247
00:18:23,154 --> 00:18:24,135
Just for a minute.

248
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,229
I didn't ask for your help.

249
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,607
I guess I have to thank you...

250
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,611
but it was rude for you not to introduce yourself first.

251
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,134
How old-fashioned.

252
00:18:45,154 --> 00:18:46,614
You sound like my grandma.

253
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,251
Go away and leave me alone!

254
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,430
What a cool witch.

255
00:19:04,862 --> 00:19:06,149
Stay here alone?

256
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:07,456
I don't understand.

257
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:08,763
Aren't your parents here with you?

258
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:11,160
No.

259
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,057
I'm a witch, so since I'm 13, I'm supposed to be independent.

260
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,362
May I see some identification?

261
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,572
Never mind then.

262
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:34,163
- Are you going to eat that?

263
00:19:34,183 --> 00:19:35,873
- You can have it.

264
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,513
It's going to be getting dark fairly soon.

265
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,814
Let's go.

266
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,730
Let's just find another town.

267
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,649
There must be a nicer one.

268
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,210
Lady!

269
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,648
Your pacifier!

270
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,328
Lady, you forgot this!

271
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:55,295
When that baby wakes up and doesn't find this, he's gonna cry.

272
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:03,294
I'm sorry, sir, but could you wait just a minute?

273
00:21:03,314 --> 00:21:05,296
I'll be right back.

274
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,802
- I could bring it down to her.

275
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:13,804
- What?

276
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,649
The woman with the baby carriage, right?

277
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,694
That'd be a big help.

278
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:21,874
- Thank you very much.

279
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:22,937
- My pleasure.

280
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,325
Let's go, Jiji.

281
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,085
Wow!

282
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:49,265
Sorry to startle you, but you left this pacifier in the bakery.

283
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,660
Here you go.

284
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:09,869
The usual?

285
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,132
Hi!

286
00:22:11,152 --> 00:22:12,154
Come on in!

287
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,505
Thank you.

288
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,341
Next!

289
00:22:24,728 --> 00:22:25,333
Thank you.

290
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:25,958
Bye.

291
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,224
Take care.

292
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:39,649
I must say, I nearly fainted when I saw you fly off.

293
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,527
That woman told me to give you this message.

294
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,740
" I got the pacifier you sent.

295
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,077
Thank you!"

296
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,288
I guess I should be going.

297
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,205
Wait!

298
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,240
Where are you going so fast?

299
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,700
I want to thank you.

300
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,633
Come up here.

301
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:12,234
Sit down and relax.

302
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:13,422
I'll make us some coffee.

303
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:28,959
- Thank you very much.

304
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:30,147
- And this is for you.

305
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:34,695
I see.

306
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:36,447
You need to find your own town.

307
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,628
Yes, but people don't seem fond of witches in this town.

308
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,839
There are many kinds of people in a big town like this.

309
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:46,143
Take me, for instance.

310
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:47,331
I like you very much.

311
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,138
Found a place to stay yet?

312
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:59,145
You should have told me you hadn't.

313
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,106
We have a vacant room in the attic you can stay in.

314
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,358
You'd give me a room?

315
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,070
I'd be happy to.

316
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:08,416
Let me introduce myself.

317
00:24:08,436 --> 00:24:09,646
I'm Osono.

318
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,158
My name's Kiki.

319
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,160
This is my black cat Jiji.

320
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,969
It's not very clean at the moment, but it's all yours.

321
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:31,844
Thank you.

322
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,513
Bathroom and water are downstairs.

323
00:24:33,691 --> 00:24:35,338
- Don't hesitate to ask for anything.

324
00:24:35,358 --> 00:24:37,005
- Thank you!

325
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,690
There's flour everywhere.

326
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,539
At this rate, I'll be a white cat by morning.

327
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,087
Jiji, come look at the ocean from here.

328
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,138
Shall we try to find another town?

329
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,734
The Freedom Adventurer has commenced its maiden voyage to Antarctica.

330
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,236
What a snob.

331
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,631
I've decided to stay awhile.

332
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,759
Maybe I can find others like Osono...

333
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,095
who will like me and accept me for what I am.

334
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,045
How much do you think a phone would cost to put in here?

335
00:27:53,223 --> 00:27:54,259
- A phone?

336
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,315
- Yeah.

337
00:27:55,335 --> 00:27:56,371
For my business.

338
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:19,405
Good morning, everyone.

339
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:20,730
- Did you sleep well?

340
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,897
- Yes!

341
00:28:22,044 --> 00:28:23,191
That smells good.

342
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:24,358
Can I help out?

343
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,726
A delivery service, huh?

344
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:54,065
I have one skill - flying - so I thought a delivery service was a good idea.

345
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:55,994
Everyone will love it.

346
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:57,557
Kiki's Flying Delivery Service.

347
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,656
And you can base the business out of your room upstairs.

348
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:02,782
Really?

349
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,617
Thank you.

350
00:29:05,963 --> 00:29:07,423
- I'd like to put a phone up there.

351
00:29:07,443 --> 00:29:08,903
- But a phone costs money.

352
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:10,551
- I have some saved up already.

353
00:29:10,571 --> 00:29:12,031
- Don't waste it.

354
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,253
Why not use our phone?

355
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:18,047
It takes time to get regular customers.

356
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:22,510
If you help around the bakery, you won't have to pay rent or the phone bill.

357
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,054
I need a lot of help since I'm expecting a baby.

358
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,348
And I'll throw in free breakfast too.

359
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,767
Thank you!

360
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,644
I'll do my very best for you.

361
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,648
You're such a wonderful person!

362
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:08,671
Jiji, come on!

363
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:09,671
I'm all done!

364
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:13,686
It's time to go shopping.

365
00:30:29,588 --> 00:30:31,069
Stop jumping out into the street.

366
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:32,570
We're not at home.

367
00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:33,988
I'm sorry.

368
00:30:34,008 --> 00:30:35,280
I won't do it again.

369
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:40,129
I've never been more embarrassed in my whole life.

370
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,964
It was so terrible!

371
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,810
I wish I had something pretty to wear.

372
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,405
Boy, this is expensive.

373
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,574
Kiki, look!

374
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,589
Do you have any money left?

375
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:27,134
We'll just have to eat pancakes for a while.

376
00:31:39,616 --> 00:31:40,430
Wow!

377
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,264
Those are beautiful.

378
00:31:49,418 --> 00:31:50,378
Wait!

379
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:51,358
Pull over a second!

380
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,204
Miss Witch!

381
00:31:58,792 --> 00:31:59,959
Not flying today?

382
00:32:02,305 --> 00:32:03,494
What'd I tell you?

383
00:32:03,514 --> 00:32:04,703
Black is all she wears.

384
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:05,705
Wait!

385
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:06,580
Come back!

386
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,455
I'm sorry!

387
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:08,330
I was only kidding!

388
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,440
Perfect timing, Kiki.

389
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:24,432
A lady wants you to deliver something.

390
00:32:24,452 --> 00:32:26,308
She's your first customer.

391
00:32:26,496 --> 00:32:27,456
Customer?

392
00:32:27,476 --> 00:32:28,436
I'll be right back!

393
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,410
The map!

394
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,299
This lady is a customer of ours.

395
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,968
We were talking about your delivery service.

396
00:32:51,354 --> 00:32:52,814
- You are a cute little witch.

397
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:54,294
- My name's Kiki, ma'am.

398
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,267
Could you deliver this by tonight?

399
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,269
Yes!

400
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,439
It's my nephew's birthday.

401
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,233
But I can't get there myself to give him his present.

402
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,319
Where do you want it delivered?

403
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,531
That's me.

404
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,242
It won't be too far?

405
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,369
I can fly there directly from here.

406
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:19,341
- How much do you want?

407
00:33:19,361 --> 00:33:21,113
- I haven't really set a price yet.

408
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,792
Is this enough?

409
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,893
This is more than enough.

410
00:33:29,913 --> 00:33:31,206
Thank you very much, ma'am.

411
00:33:56,253 --> 00:33:56,942
Oh, wow!

412
00:33:56,962 --> 00:33:57,651
That's great!

413
00:33:57,796 --> 00:33:59,152
- I wish I could fly.

414
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:00,528
- Yeah!

415
00:34:00,548 --> 00:34:01,904
Hey, do you know that girl?

416
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:23,102
How high do you intend to go?

417
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:25,219
It's my first delivery.

418
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,012
I don't want to be stopped by that police officer.

419
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:32,319
I was afraid you were going to deliver it to the angels.

420
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,327
It's just beyond the cape.

421
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,039
Here we go!

422
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,633
I'm liking this town more and more.

423
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,427
I'm not sure what I think.

424
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,513
I'll finally be able to write Mom.

425
00:35:18,668 --> 00:35:19,773
Those are wild geese.

426
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:20,898
Wonderful!

427
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,748
They're flying along with us!

428
00:35:51,493 --> 00:35:52,870
- They seem awfully upset.

429
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,267
- They say a wind's coming.

430
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,737
They also say they're going higher.

431
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,171
Oh, no!

432
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:35,113
I'm sorry.

433
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:35,919
I...

434
00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:36,725
Oww!

435
00:36:41,126 --> 00:36:42,329
Please!

436
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:43,552
I'm sorry!

437
00:36:43,572 --> 00:36:44,775
I wasn't trying to steal your eggs!

438
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,629
I've never been so scared.

439
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:57,893
It's your fault.

440
00:36:57,913 --> 00:36:59,957
They warned us of that wind, but you didn't listen.

441
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:00,884
You're right.

442
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:06,631
That's beautiful.

443
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:08,549
They were able to fly that high up with the wind.

444
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:09,977
Kiki!

445
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,854
The toy is gone!

446
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,731
Oh no!

447
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,691
We've gotta go back to where we fell!

448
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,708
They're saying, "The egg thief's coming again!"

449
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,585
What are we gonna do?

450
00:37:50,987 --> 00:37:51,572
Hey!

451
00:37:51,592 --> 00:37:52,177
Stop that!

452
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,313
Don't do that!

453
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,065
Stop it!

454
00:38:09,047 --> 00:38:10,048
We're in trouble.

455
00:38:10,068 --> 00:38:11,069
They're still upset.

456
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,041
Witches get no respect these days.

457
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,585
Crows used to be witches' servants.

458
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,129
That was a long time ago, okay?

459
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,008
How about we go get it after dark?

460
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,178
We'll never make it in time.

461
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,847
There's only one way to do it.

462
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,849
They'll find out I'm a fake.

463
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,144
After I find it, I'll be right back to help you out.

464
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,015
- Is that the place?

465
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:39,891
- Yes.

466
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:40,767
Don't move a muscle.

467
00:38:40,912 --> 00:38:41,872
- Can I breathe?

468
00:38:41,892 --> 00:38:42,852
- Hold it as long as you can.

469
00:39:00,557 --> 00:39:01,704
Yea!

470
00:39:01,724 --> 00:39:02,871
Give me my present!

471
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,386
That's pretty weird.

472
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,768
A bit late, aren't you?

473
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,229
After my sister telephoned, we were wondering where you were.

474
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,730
I'm sorry.

475
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:24,736
Could I please have your signature?

476
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,991
Mom, can I put the canaries in here?

477
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,077
Uh-huh, but be careful you don't let any of them escape.

478
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,245
Okay.

479
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,250
Thank you very much.

480
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,430
Come on, birdie!

481
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,766
I'm gonna put you in a bigger house!

482
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,063
Please hurry, Kiki.

483
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,931
I know it was here, so it's gotta be around someplace.

484
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,363
There it is!

485
00:40:54,796 --> 00:40:55,526
Excuse me!

486
00:40:55,546 --> 00:40:56,276
Anybody home?

487
00:40:57,006 --> 00:40:58,049
Can you please help me?

488
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:59,112
Anybody?

489
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,173
Anybody here?

490
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:09,790
Yeah!

491
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,249
I can't come down right now.

492
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,514
Why don't you come up?

493
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:27,734
What do you want?

494
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,905
That stuffed black cat you put on your window sill?

495
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:32,793
I'm sorry, but it's mine.

496
00:41:32,813 --> 00:41:33,523
I dropped it.

497
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,869
Be good, and don't move yet.

498
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,541
I found it in the forest.

499
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,419
Would you give it back to me, please?

500
00:41:46,264 --> 00:41:47,286
Hang on a minute.

501
00:41:47,306 --> 00:41:48,328
I can't stop just now.

502
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:50,935
Nice.

503
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:51,831
Very nice.

504
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,469
You're beautiful just the way you are.

505
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,732
You really should have told me you were in a hurry.

506
00:42:09,996 --> 00:42:11,581
- I got sort of fond of it.

507
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:13,186
- I'm sorry.

508
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,659
The stuffing's coming out.

509
00:42:17,837 --> 00:42:19,109
I'll bet the crows did it.

510
00:42:19,129 --> 00:42:20,401
They made such a fuss.

511
00:42:20,923 --> 00:42:22,154
What am I gonna do?

512
00:42:22,174 --> 00:42:23,405
I can't deliver it like this.

513
00:42:26,012 --> 00:42:27,326
Say!

514
00:42:27,346 --> 00:42:28,660
How about we work out a deal?

515
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:32,144
That's pretty exciting.

516
00:42:32,164 --> 00:42:33,249
And at 13 too.

517
00:42:34,395 --> 00:42:35,313
To be independent.

518
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:36,251
That's great.

519
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:38,024
- Can you fix it?

520
00:42:38,044 --> 00:42:39,629
- Trust me.

521
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,316
Ketto, time for your bath.

522
00:42:52,038 --> 00:42:54,124
Quickly!

523
00:42:54,144 --> 00:42:56,230
The guests will be here soon!

524
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,701
Ketto!

525
00:43:59,105 --> 00:44:00,315
- I'm done.

526
00:44:00,335 --> 00:44:01,545
- Thank you so much!

527
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,307
You'd better help Jiji before it's too late.

528
00:44:04,443 --> 00:44:05,632
- But I haven't finished yet.

529
00:44:05,652 --> 00:44:06,841
- You've done enough.

530
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:08,050
Go help him.

531
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,021
Thanks!

532
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:23,201
Jeff likes my present more than me!

533
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,120
It is strange, you know.

534
00:44:25,298 --> 00:44:26,883
He adores that stuffed cat.

535
00:44:26,903 --> 00:44:28,488
He won't leave it alone.

536
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,375
He thinks it's a puppy.

537
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:33,003
Your sister's not going to be happy to hear that.

538
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:35,371
- That's okay.

539
00:44:35,391 --> 00:44:37,123
I gave it to Jeff anyway.

540
00:44:37,143 --> 00:44:38,875
- Remember to tell Auntie "thank you".

541
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:41,585
You should be nicer to him.

542
00:44:41,605 --> 00:44:44,129
Jeff is a very old dog.

543
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,975
But, Grandma, all he does is sleep!

544
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,227
I suppose that's true.

545
00:44:49,906 --> 00:44:51,449
Ketto, go open the door.

546
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:53,012
Jeff wants to go out.

547
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,903
Be sure to push the door shut when you're finished.

548
00:45:07,006 --> 00:45:08,195
- Jiji!

549
00:45:08,215 --> 00:45:09,404
- Kiki, what took you so long?

550
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,916
I'm sorry.

551
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,919
That marvelous dog helped me escape.

552
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,469
He said he'd be happy to help us out.

553
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,811
Would you take this back in?

554
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,969
What's the matter?

555
00:46:04,105 --> 00:46:05,273
- I'm famished.

556
00:46:05,293 --> 00:46:06,461
- Yeah, me too.

557
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,014
And I'm tired too.

558
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,141
But it sure was a wonderful adventure.

559
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:15,188
And that painter who found the stuffed cat wants to do a drawing with me in it.

560
00:46:15,366 --> 00:46:15,992
- Naked?

561
00:46:16,012 --> 00:46:16,638
- Don't be silly!

562
00:46:25,116 --> 00:47:54,120
"Kiki's Delivery Service" Boring.

563
00:48:02,473 --> 00:48:03,829
Hey!

564
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:05,205
Aren't you supposed to be minding the shop?

565
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,009
I am, but nobody's coming in today.

566
00:48:08,145 --> 00:48:10,857
- But it always gets busy around now.

567
00:48:10,877 --> 00:48:13,589
- I know, but I mean my customers.

568
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:19,771
Jiji, if nobody comes in I'll have to eat pancakes forever...

569
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,024
and be fat, fat, fat!

570
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,693
So, what am I supposed to do?

571
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,655
I think pancakes are superb, provided they're not burnt.

572
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:31,710
You're no help.

573
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:34,149
When you get fat, see if I care.

574
00:48:41,303 --> 00:48:42,784
Beautiful, isn't she?

575
00:48:42,804 --> 00:48:44,285
Somebody told me she's a fashion designer.

576
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,549
Personally, I'm not very fond of her conceited cat.

577
00:48:51,272 --> 00:48:52,294
Hello.

578
00:48:52,314 --> 00:48:53,336
Gutiokipan Bakery.

579
00:48:53,691 --> 00:48:54,734
Pardon?

580
00:48:54,754 --> 00:48:55,797
Yes, ma'am.

581
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:58,309
About time we got a customer.

582
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:02,063
4:30 will be a perfect time to pick it up.

583
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,399
And the address?

584
00:49:04,535 --> 00:49:05,530
Yes.

585
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,545
The blue roof.

586
00:49:06,565 --> 00:49:07,560
Right.

587
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,113
Yes, I'm sure I have it all.

588
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,198
Thank you very much.

589
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:16,077
Hi.

590
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,004
I'll take this one.

591
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,798
Okay?

592
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,014
Thank you very much.

593
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,391
Are you still mad at me?

594
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,810
We're having a party at the club tonight.

595
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:44,981
It's called the flying club, and we'd really like you to come.

596
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,192
Here's your invitation.

597
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:52,739
It really is a serious club.

598
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,950
Everybody would be very happy if you came.

599
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,619
May I help you?

600
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:00,622
They tell me you have a delivery service.

601
00:50:00,841 --> 00:50:01,697
Oh.

602
00:50:01,717 --> 00:50:02,573
Pardon me.

603
00:50:02,593 --> 00:50:03,449
Yes, of course we do.

604
00:50:03,677 --> 00:50:05,012
It's urgent this package arrive tonight.

605
00:50:05,032 --> 00:50:06,367
Can you do it?

606
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,254
Of course we can...

607
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:10,757
Are you gonna be all right?

608
00:50:10,893 --> 00:50:11,728
- Uh-huh.

609
00:50:11,748 --> 00:50:12,583
- Can I help you?

610
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:13,801
Uh-uh.

611
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,738
I'll be back at 6:00, so make up your mind by then.

612
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:35,532
How much will that be?

613
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,201
Will that be inside or outside the city limits?

614
00:50:38,379 --> 00:50:39,526
- I wrote it down on the box.

615
00:50:39,546 --> 00:50:40,693
- The box?

616
00:50:40,713 --> 00:50:41,860
Oh, I'm sorry.

617
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,751
Osono!

618
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,296
I got an invitation to a party at Tombo's flying club.

619
00:50:50,432 --> 00:50:51,329
Terrific!

620
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:52,246
You'll have a wonderful time.

621
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,759
But what am I gonna wear?

622
00:50:55,271 --> 00:50:57,335
Kiki, I wouldn't worry too much.

623
00:50:57,355 --> 00:50:59,419
You look fine in that.

624
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,516
It makes you look beautiful and mysterious.

625
00:51:02,111 --> 00:51:02,883
- You mean it?

626
00:51:02,903 --> 00:51:03,675
- Any work yet?

627
00:51:03,988 --> 00:51:05,510
I almost forgot about it!

628
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,052
It's already 4:00!

629
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,189
Oh, no!

630
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,901
Can you watch the store 'til I get back?

631
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:13,164
Jiji!

632
00:51:13,184 --> 00:51:14,102
Jiji!

633
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:33,256
Why are you going to this party when you're so mad at him?

634
00:51:33,392 --> 00:51:34,581
I have to concentrate.

635
00:51:34,601 --> 00:51:35,790
This thing is heavy.

636
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:36,999
Be quiet.

637
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,197
Thank you.

638
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,158
Come on!

639
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,248
Our next appointment is at 4:30.

640
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,181
There's the blue roof.

641
00:52:42,044 --> 00:52:44,171
My name's Kiki.

642
00:52:44,191 --> 00:52:46,318
Someone telephoned for a delivery service, so here I am.

643
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,790
Right this way, dear.

644
00:52:54,682 --> 00:52:56,580
- You're right on time.

645
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,498
- Yes, ma'am.

646
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,931
Madam, the delivery girl is here.

647
00:53:06,068 --> 00:53:07,298
What?

648
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:08,548
Oh, my goodness!

649
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:13,022
Is it that time already?

650
00:53:13,617 --> 00:53:14,347
- Come, come.

651
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,097
- Thanks.

652
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,235
May I take that for you?

653
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,745
Broom and black cat.

654
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:31,040
It's just like my great-grandmother always told me.

655
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,419
My name is Kiki, and I'm a witch.

656
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:38,798
Oh, and what a cute little girl you are.

657
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:44,429
I'm so sorry, but that pie you were supposed to deliver isn't ready yet.

658
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:49,434
The temperature doesn't seem to go up at all.

659
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,185
Something's wrong.

660
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:57,567
Machines don't work when they become old like me.

661
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:01,904
I was hoping you could deliver it hot to my grandchild's birthday party.

662
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:06,743
It's one of my favorite recipes: herring and pumpkin pie.

663
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,412
I guess I have to admit defeat.

664
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,165
I'll have to phone her and tell her I'm sorry.

665
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:15,376
I feel just awful having you come here for nothing.

666
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,669
Bertha!

667
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,884
Would you get her money, please.

668
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,177
Certainly, ma'am.

669
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,794
All of it.

670
00:54:25,814 --> 00:54:27,128
Pay her the amount we agreed on.

671
00:54:27,316 --> 00:54:28,116
- Oh, no.

672
00:54:28,136 --> 00:54:28,936
Please!

673
00:54:28,956 --> 00:54:29,756
- Now, don't be silly.

674
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,976
It's not your fault it wasn't ready.

675
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,117
I have no other jobs today.

676
00:54:36,137 --> 00:54:37,514
Maybe I could help.

677
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,317
Does that oven over there work?

678
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,153
You mean that one?

679
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:47,825
It used to be the only one I ever used, but I haven't opened it in years.

680
00:54:48,128 --> 00:54:50,318
If it burns firewood, I can help.

681
00:54:50,338 --> 00:54:52,528
I used to help my mom all the time.

682
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:55,166
It's a big job to build a fire.

683
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:56,793
It's a great idea, madam.

684
00:54:56,919 --> 00:55:00,755
I never did like that electric thing, and we have plenty of firewood.

685
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,340
I can build a fire.

686
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:06,844
Well, I'm not sure, but if you think you can build it...

687
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,352
But won't this make you late for your party?

688
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,437
I can't take money for nothing.

689
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:25,354
Come on.

690
00:55:25,374 --> 00:55:25,938
We have to hurry up.

691
00:55:28,168 --> 00:55:29,336
Look what I found.

692
00:55:29,356 --> 00:55:30,524
And it works!

693
00:55:31,255 --> 00:55:33,195
You're very good at this, my dear.

694
00:55:33,215 --> 00:55:35,155
Your mother taught you well.

695
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,884
Oh, my goodness, it's so exciting.

696
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,804
Never did like electricity.

697
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,070
It should be about time.

698
00:56:06,415 --> 00:56:07,416
Yes, very good.

699
00:56:07,436 --> 00:56:08,437
Well done.

700
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,419
And now we wait.

701
00:56:21,638 --> 00:56:22,619
- About 40 minutes or so.

702
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:23,620
Right?

703
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,621
- Exactly right.

704
00:56:24,766 --> 00:56:26,831
- So why don't we take a little break?

705
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:28,916
- Do you need help with anything else?

706
00:56:29,354 --> 00:56:31,127
Oh!

707
00:56:31,147 --> 00:56:32,920
Well, if you'd really like to...

708
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,433
Thanks very much.

709
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,268
You're very welcome.

710
00:56:38,947 --> 00:56:40,637
- You're going to be late for the party.

711
00:56:40,657 --> 00:56:42,347
- Stop worrying.

712
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,568
It'll only take me 15 minutes if I fly there fast.

713
00:56:47,122 --> 00:56:48,687
Would you care for some tea?

714
00:56:48,707 --> 00:56:50,272
I just made a pot.

715
00:56:52,586 --> 00:56:53,796
I just remembered.

716
00:56:53,816 --> 00:56:55,026
Won't you be late for your party?

717
00:56:55,297 --> 00:56:56,778
It won't be a problem.

718
00:56:56,798 --> 00:56:58,279
It'll take me 15 minutes from here.

719
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:03,169
But, my dear, that clock runs about ten minutes slow.

720
00:57:03,847 --> 00:57:05,390
- What'll I do?

721
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:06,953
- See if the pie's ready.

722
00:57:08,852 --> 00:57:09,562
Bertha!

723
00:57:09,582 --> 00:57:10,292
Bertha!

724
00:57:19,488 --> 00:57:21,240
- Is the pie ready?

725
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,012
- It smells fine, so you'd better hurry.

726
00:57:32,042 --> 00:57:32,543
Better hurry!

727
00:57:32,563 --> 00:57:33,064
Come on!

728
00:57:33,585 --> 00:57:34,920
- Okay.

729
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,275
- Don't forget your money.

730
00:57:36,463 --> 00:57:37,923
- That's way too much.

731
00:57:37,943 --> 00:57:39,403
- Not for what you've done.

732
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,666
Hurry up, Kiki, or you'll be late!

733
00:57:42,678 --> 00:57:43,908
- Have a good time!

734
00:57:43,928 --> 00:57:45,158
- Be careful!

735
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:54,637
What happened to all that good weather?

736
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,430
My whiskers are tingling.

737
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,086
- Could we get out of the rain?

738
00:58:22,106 --> 00:58:23,393
- We can't!

739
00:58:23,413 --> 00:58:24,700
That'll only make us later!

740
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:26,711
Besides, the food will get cold if we stop.

741
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,108
Yes?

742
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,985
I have a delivery.

743
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,737
But it's completely wet.

744
00:59:35,749 --> 00:59:36,952
I'm sorry.

745
00:59:36,972 --> 00:59:38,175
It began to rain on the way.

746
00:59:38,195 --> 00:59:39,398
But the food came through all right.

747
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:42,912
I told Grandma I didn't want that.

748
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,706
Grandma sent another of her crummy herring pies!

749
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:50,044
Um, would you please sign this receipt for me?

750
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:54,131
I hate Grandma's stupid pies.

751
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:02,473
She can't possibly have been her granddaughter.

752
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,947
Do you think we can still make it in time?

753
01:00:42,065 --> 01:00:42,754
Look!

754
01:00:42,774 --> 01:00:43,463
Tombo's down there!

755
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,724
We can still make it.

756
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:54,191
That certainly was quite an ordeal.

757
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,485
That boy waited a very long time.

758
01:00:57,038 --> 01:00:58,331
Doesn't matter anyway.

759
01:00:58,351 --> 01:00:59,644
I can't go in these wet clothes.

760
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,878
Kiki, what's wrong?

761
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,671
Do you have a headache?

762
01:01:17,392 --> 01:01:18,957
Why don't we grab a bite to eat?

763
01:01:18,977 --> 01:01:20,542
I know I'm famished.

764
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,538
Kiki!

765
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,436
Not feeling very well, huh?

766
01:02:15,283 --> 01:02:17,223
- You have quite a fever.

767
01:02:17,243 --> 01:02:19,183
- Is someone pounding on my head?

768
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:22,279
I'll bet you never dried yourself off completely yesterday.

769
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,783
Am I gonna shrivel up and die?

770
01:02:29,506 --> 01:02:31,049
You have a cold, is all.

771
01:02:31,069 --> 01:02:32,612
I'll bring up some medicine.

772
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:35,167
And you should eat something.

773
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,502
I'm not hungry.

774
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,463
It'll be better if you eat now.

775
01:02:39,641 --> 01:02:40,997
How about some oatmeal?

776
01:02:41,017 --> 01:02:42,373
Like some, Jiji?

777
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,349
Oatmeal's the best thing for a cold.

778
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:52,893
There you go.

779
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:56,188
Don't burn your tongue.

780
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:03,237
Come and eat your oatmeal before it gets cold.

781
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:05,823
Do I have to eat?

782
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:07,241
If you want to get well.

783
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:10,744
That boy was in the shop a while ago.

784
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:16,500
When I told him you were sick, he asked how a witch could catch a cold.

785
01:03:18,638 --> 01:03:19,890
Oh, yes.

786
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:21,162
He said he wanted to visit you a little later.

787
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,548
Oh, no!

788
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:27,261
I figured you might say that, so I politely refused.

789
01:03:27,397 --> 01:03:28,732
You're tired.

790
01:03:28,752 --> 01:03:30,087
Just relax and sleep.

791
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,351
I'll just open the window for some fresh air.

792
01:03:41,369 --> 01:03:42,224
- Osono.

793
01:03:42,244 --> 01:03:43,099
- Hmm?

794
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,613
Um, never mind.

795
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:15,726
Jiji!

796
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,395
Jiji!

797
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:20,564
What?

798
01:04:47,936 --> 01:04:49,000
Jiji!

799
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:50,084
Breakfast is ready!

800
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,428
Kiki?

801
01:04:51,981 --> 01:04:53,462
- Feeling better this morning?

802
01:04:53,482 --> 01:04:54,963
- Much better, thank you.

803
01:04:55,151 --> 01:04:56,298
I'm sorry.

804
01:04:56,318 --> 01:04:57,465
I didn't realize I'd overslept.

805
01:04:57,654 --> 01:04:59,052
That's okay.

806
01:04:59,072 --> 01:05:00,470
Come down here later.

807
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:01,888
I have a favor to ask of you.

808
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:02,940
Okay.

809
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,275
"Koppori. " Is that right?

810
01:05:05,412 --> 01:05:06,267
Uh-huh.

811
01:05:06,287 --> 01:05:07,142
Is this enough money?

812
01:05:07,997 --> 01:05:09,061
That's all right.

813
01:05:09,081 --> 01:05:10,145
It's close enough to walk from here.

814
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:11,730
Don't be silly.

815
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,855
Work is work.

816
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,868
And be sure to deliver it to him direct.

817
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:19,081
Jiji!

818
01:05:20,093 --> 01:05:21,511
- You have work?

819
01:05:21,531 --> 01:05:22,949
- It's not far away.

820
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,336
Who's your friend?

821
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:26,225
Lily's her name.

822
01:05:26,245 --> 01:05:27,330
I'll be down.

823
01:05:27,976 --> 01:05:29,082
Don't worry.

824
01:05:29,102 --> 01:05:30,208
I'll be back in a minute.

825
01:05:30,228 --> 01:05:31,334
Pleasure to meet you, Lily.

826
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,268
Wonderful.

827
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:31,707
Hey!

828
01:06:31,727 --> 01:06:32,854
Miss Witch!

829
01:06:36,377 --> 01:06:38,546
- Taking a walk?

830
01:06:38,566 --> 01:06:40,735
- I'm looking for someone named Koppori.

831
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,248
Hey, that's my name!

832
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:46,909
Go around that way.

833
01:06:46,929 --> 01:06:48,118
I'll be right with you.

834
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,884
I'll bet Osono planned this.

835
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,099
Gee, thanks a lot.

836
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,899
I want to apologize for making you wait the other night.

837
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,402
I'm sorry you got wet.

838
01:07:12,997 --> 01:07:14,666
Want to come over to my place?

839
01:07:14,686 --> 01:07:16,355
I have something to show you.

840
01:07:18,086 --> 01:07:18,712
Come on!

841
01:07:18,732 --> 01:07:19,358
Hurry!

842
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:26,083
That party was to celebrate the completion of this thing.

843
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,754
This is the engine of a human-propelled plane.

844
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,589
Like it?

845
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:37,427
We're assembling the wings and the frame at somebody else's house.

846
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:41,306
I'm planning on flying this thing during my summer vacation.

847
01:07:46,656 --> 01:07:48,408
Hey!

848
01:07:48,428 --> 01:07:50,180
Let's go see where that dirigible suddenly landed!

849
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,984
"Dirigible"?

850
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,069
You didn't see it on TV?

851
01:07:54,205 --> 01:07:55,582
- I was sleeping.

852
01:07:55,602 --> 01:07:56,979
- Then we have to go!

853
01:07:57,792 --> 01:07:58,856
- We're going with this?

854
01:07:58,876 --> 01:07:59,940
- Why not?

855
01:08:00,086 --> 01:08:01,692
I have to practice anyway.

856
01:08:01,712 --> 01:08:03,318
Gotta build up my legs.

857
01:08:04,299 --> 01:08:05,008
Okay.

858
01:08:05,028 --> 01:08:05,737
Ready?

859
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,755
I've never ridden a bicycle before.

860
01:08:13,933 --> 01:08:14,976
Oh, boy!

861
01:08:14,996 --> 01:08:16,039
Even better!

862
01:08:16,227 --> 01:08:18,000
Brace the bike with your foot until I get her revved up.

863
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,793
Let's go!

864
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:28,478
Kick off!

865
01:08:38,166 --> 01:08:39,105
- Should I get off?

866
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:40,064
- No!

867
01:09:07,195 --> 01:09:07,800
Go faster!

868
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:08,425
Go!

869
01:09:08,613 --> 01:09:09,552
That's great!

870
01:09:09,572 --> 01:09:10,511
Hang in there!

871
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:17,361
Swing your body to the inside when we go around the curve.

872
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:20,280
Otherwise it won't turn very well.

873
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:23,825
Now!

874
01:09:27,548 --> 01:09:28,258
Great!

875
01:09:28,278 --> 01:09:28,988
You're doing fine!

876
01:09:38,476 --> 01:09:39,456
Yippee!

877
01:09:39,476 --> 01:09:40,456
Great!

878
01:09:50,571 --> 01:09:51,551
- The dirigible, right?

879
01:09:51,571 --> 01:09:52,551
- Right.

880
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,240
We're flying!

881
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:32,269
Tombo, are you okay?

882
01:10:32,405 --> 01:10:33,400
- Yeah.

883
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:34,415
Are you all right?

884
01:10:34,435 --> 01:10:35,430
- I'm okay.

885
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,587
Does my face look that funny?

886
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:04,426
I'm sorry, but when we flew over that cliff, I was so scared!

887
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,182
I was scared too.

888
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:13,268
I'll bet you used some magic.

889
01:11:13,488 --> 01:11:14,573
I'm not sure.

890
01:11:14,593 --> 01:11:15,678
I was so frightened.

891
01:11:15,823 --> 01:11:17,054
Your poor bike.

892
01:11:17,074 --> 01:11:18,305
It's a mess.

893
01:11:21,162 --> 01:11:22,080
Oh, no!

894
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,018
Am I in trouble!

895
01:11:23,247 --> 01:11:24,916
- Will you look after the bike for me?

896
01:11:24,936 --> 01:11:26,605
- What happened?

897
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,618
I pedaled too hard!

898
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,453
Wait there!

899
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:57,312
Sure would be terrific to go around the world in a dirigible like that.

900
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:00,315
How'd it make you feel, the first time you flew?

901
01:12:00,743 --> 01:12:01,890
I can't recall.

902
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:03,057
I was too young to remember.

903
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:06,154
But my mom told me I wasn't scared a bit.

904
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:10,158
Gosh, I sure wish I was born into a witch family.

905
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:13,578
You can just fly away on a broomstick, but me...

906
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,455
That's all I can do.

907
01:12:17,552 --> 01:12:19,033
I don't find flying that much fun.

908
01:12:19,053 --> 01:12:20,534
It's more of a job to me.

909
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:24,548
But I think it's wonderful that you can put your talents to work.

910
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:27,050
I sort of feel my confidence slipping.

911
01:12:27,687 --> 01:12:29,627
But I'm glad I came with you today.

912
01:12:29,647 --> 01:12:31,587
I feel better sitting by the ocean.

913
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:35,559
I could bring you here anytime you want and train myself at the same time.

914
01:12:35,736 --> 01:12:37,280
- You're a very nice person.

915
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,844
- You just found out?

916
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,981
I used to think you were kind of a clown.

917
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:43,191
My mom says the same thing.

918
01:12:43,327 --> 01:12:45,309
"You clown!

919
01:12:45,329 --> 01:12:47,311
Quit looking up to the sky and get back to your books!"

920
01:12:52,712 --> 01:12:53,630
- Tombo!

921
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:54,568
- Huh?

922
01:12:57,425 --> 01:12:58,336
- Hey!

923
01:12:58,356 --> 01:12:59,267
Guess what!

924
01:12:59,287 --> 01:13:00,198
- What?

925
01:13:00,344 --> 01:13:01,324
Something good!

926
01:13:01,344 --> 01:13:02,324
Come here!

927
01:13:02,597 --> 01:13:03,368
I'll be right back.

928
01:13:03,388 --> 01:13:04,159
Wait here.

929
01:13:08,269 --> 01:13:09,291
They said we could go inside.

930
01:13:09,311 --> 01:13:10,333
Coming?

931
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:11,182
They what?

932
01:13:11,202 --> 01:13:11,905
Wow!

933
01:13:11,925 --> 01:13:12,628
Of course!

934
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:14,598
Hey, who's your girlfriend?

935
01:13:14,859 --> 01:13:16,444
That's Kiki the Witch.

936
01:13:16,464 --> 01:13:18,049
Come on over, Kiki!

937
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:21,730
They're gonna show us around inside that dirigible!

938
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,064
No, thanks.

939
01:13:23,492 --> 01:13:24,410
Ah, come on.

940
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:25,348
It'll be fun.

941
01:13:26,454 --> 01:13:27,768
The delivery girl.

942
01:13:27,788 --> 01:13:29,102
I'm positive that's her.

943
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:30,792
- You mean she's a working girl?

944
01:13:30,812 --> 01:13:32,314
- My, how independent.

945
01:13:33,377 --> 01:13:34,253
Come on.

946
01:13:34,273 --> 01:13:35,149
I'll introduce you to everybody.

947
01:13:35,338 --> 01:13:36,214
No, thanks.

948
01:13:36,234 --> 01:13:37,110
See you later.

949
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:38,788
What's the matter?

950
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,045
What are you so mad about?

951
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,713
I'm not mad at all.

952
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:49,382
I have a lot of work to do, so just leave me alone.

953
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,473
Tombo, let's go!

954
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:36,489
I think something's wrong with me.

955
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:40,160
I make friends, then suddenly I can't bear to be with any of them.

956
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:42,662
That other me, the cheerful and honest one...

957
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,164
went away somewhere.

958
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,175
Some friend you are.

959
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:29,167
Jiji, I don't care if you do have a girlfriend.

960
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,461
You can't be late for every meal.

961
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:33,713
And clean up after yourself.

962
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:37,258
What are you talking like a cat for?

963
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,267
Jiji.

964
01:16:46,904 --> 01:16:47,718
Oh, no!

965
01:16:47,738 --> 01:16:48,552
Talk to me!

966
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:50,730
You mean you can't speak anymore?

967
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:55,777
Jiji!

968
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:57,946
I wonder what happened to him.

969
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,865
I can't figure out a word he says anymore.

970
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:02,659
Oh, my gosh!

971
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,518
I'm losing my powers.

972
01:18:28,088 --> 01:18:29,653
You can't fly anymore?

973
01:18:29,673 --> 01:18:31,238
Have you lost your magic?

974
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:36,669
It's become very weak, so I think I've gotta take a break from delivery work.

975
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:41,049
But I'll work really hard in the bakery, so please let me stay in my room.

976
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:43,593
Of course you can stay.

977
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:45,553
Will your powers come back?

978
01:18:46,607 --> 01:18:47,504
I don't know.

979
01:18:47,524 --> 01:18:48,421
Maybe.

980
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:49,338
I can make another broom, but...

981
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:55,939
Look!

982
01:19:31,318 --> 01:19:32,855
It's me, Tombo.

983
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:34,412
Did you see me today?

984
01:19:34,432 --> 01:19:35,969
I was waving at you from the dirigible.

985
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,648
The captain took me on the test flight.

986
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,400
It was great!

987
01:19:41,078 --> 01:19:42,100
Hello?

988
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,142
Kiki, are you there?

989
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:44,654
Please don't call me anymore.

990
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:46,313
What?

991
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:47,856
I can barely hear you.

992
01:19:47,876 --> 01:19:49,399
The captain said he'd like to meet you.

993
01:19:50,504 --> 01:19:51,297
Hey, come on!

994
01:19:51,317 --> 01:19:52,110
Don't hang up!

995
01:19:55,843 --> 01:19:56,886
What's wrong?

996
01:19:56,906 --> 01:19:57,949
You don't look like you feel well.

997
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:01,254
I'm still training to be a witch.

998
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:05,675
If I lose my magic, that means I've lost absolutely everything.

999
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,872
Kiki!

1000
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:38,333
Hi!

1001
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:44,213
You didn't come pay me a visit, so I had to come visit you.

1002
01:20:44,391 --> 01:20:46,185
- I'm sorry.

1003
01:20:46,205 --> 01:20:47,999
- Well, I also came to shop a little.

1004
01:20:48,604 --> 01:20:49,473
Come on in.

1005
01:20:49,493 --> 01:20:50,362
I'm done now.

1006
01:20:50,382 --> 01:20:51,251
We can take a break.

1007
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:53,389
You'd better believe I will.

1008
01:20:57,529 --> 01:20:58,760
- Nice place you have.

1009
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:00,011
- Help yourself to these.

1010
01:21:00,157 --> 01:21:01,221
- I'll make some fresh tea.

1011
01:21:01,241 --> 01:21:02,305
- No tea, thanks.

1012
01:21:02,325 --> 01:21:03,389
Do you have some milk?

1013
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:04,400
Sure.

1014
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,533
Positively amazing.

1015
01:21:12,669 --> 01:21:14,484
The spitting image of that stuffed cat.

1016
01:21:14,504 --> 01:21:16,319
You're Jiji, right?

1017
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:21,209
How's the home delivery business?

1018
01:21:25,391 --> 01:21:27,059
- That bad, huh?

1019
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:28,747
- I'm not working much now.

1020
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:41,270
I thought you seemed down.

1021
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:43,856
I didn't know things like that happened to witches.

1022
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:52,740
Why not come and stay at my place?

1023
01:21:55,003 --> 01:21:56,713
Tell your boss you need a break.

1024
01:21:56,733 --> 01:21:58,443
They'll manage somehow.

1025
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,081
How about it, Jiji?

1026
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:06,879
Rather be with your girlfriend?

1027
01:22:07,099 --> 01:22:07,975
Come on!

1028
01:22:07,995 --> 01:22:08,871
Let's go!

1029
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:20,843
Hurry!

1030
01:22:20,863 --> 01:22:21,427
The bus is leaving!

1031
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:14,322
I'm bushed!

1032
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:17,325
It's so beautiful here.

1033
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:30,713
Must've been blind, with two beautiful girls in front of him.

1034
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,405
What do you mean, you thought I was a boy?

1035
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:58,658
Well, look at the way you're dressed.

1036
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:03,037
Tell me what kind of boy has these legs, mister.

1037
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:11,891
- Crows!

1038
01:24:11,911 --> 01:24:13,163
- We've become real close friends.

1039
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:14,465
Wow.

1040
01:24:15,602 --> 01:24:16,666
Hello, everybody.

1041
01:24:16,686 --> 01:24:17,750
We're home again.

1042
01:24:17,938 --> 01:24:19,252
Good afternoon.

1043
01:24:19,272 --> 01:24:20,586
I'm sorry I bothered you before.

1044
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:28,396
Make yourself at home while I get some water.

1045
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:25,661
Like it?

1046
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:26,954
Wonderful.

1047
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:29,999
I got the idea for it after we met the first time.

1048
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:33,836
But I really haven't got the girl's face right.

1049
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,757
I've been waiting for you to come back.

1050
01:25:37,893 --> 01:25:38,811
- You mean, that's me?

1051
01:25:38,831 --> 01:25:39,749
- Yes.

1052
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:42,511
Would you be my model?

1053
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:44,764
But I'm not beautiful.

1054
01:25:50,072 --> 01:25:51,865
You've got a great face.

1055
01:25:51,885 --> 01:25:53,678
Besides, it's prettier than it was the last time.

1056
01:25:54,076 --> 01:25:54,806
Come on.

1057
01:25:54,826 --> 01:25:55,556
Have a seat.

1058
01:25:55,576 --> 01:25:56,306
Right there.

1059
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:02,406
Lift up your head a little.

1060
01:26:02,542 --> 01:26:03,620
Look beyond the horizon.

1061
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:04,718
Don't move.

1062
01:26:04,738 --> 01:26:05,816
Very good.

1063
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,538
Painting and magical powers seem to be very similar.

1064
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:11,517
- Sometimes I can't paint a thing.

1065
01:26:11,537 --> 01:26:13,004
- You mean it?

1066
01:26:13,024 --> 01:26:14,491
Then what happens?

1067
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:16,379
Kiki, don't look over here.

1068
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:22,885
Without even thinking about it I used to be able to fly.

1069
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:26,847
Now I can't even begin to remember how I ever managed to do it.

1070
01:26:29,444 --> 01:26:30,571
At times like that, you know what I do?

1071
01:26:30,591 --> 01:26:31,718
Paint.

1072
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:33,896
That gets rid of my frustrations.

1073
01:26:34,449 --> 01:26:36,410
- But still, if I can't fly...

1074
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:38,391
- Then I just stop.

1075
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:41,320
Take long walks, look at the scenery, doze off at noon.

1076
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:42,738
Don't do a single thing.

1077
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:45,825
Then, suddenly, I'm able to paint again.

1078
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,326
Maybe that'll help.

1079
01:26:47,754 --> 01:26:48,665
Trust me.

1080
01:26:48,685 --> 01:26:49,596
It'll happen.

1081
01:26:49,616 --> 01:26:50,527
Come on, don't ruin the pose.

1082
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:15,938
When I was your age, I'd already decided to become an artist.

1083
01:27:16,450 --> 01:27:18,056
I loved painting.

1084
01:27:18,076 --> 01:27:19,682
So much that I couldn't sleep.

1085
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:22,987
Then one day, for no reason, I became unable to paint.

1086
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,074
So I just kept on painting anyway, but still it was no good.

1087
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:31,328
I realized that I was just imitating other painters.

1088
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,623
Just copies of paintings I'd seen somewhere.

1089
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,293
I swore I'd paint my own pictures.

1090
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:39,879
That must've been hard.

1091
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:44,967
But after that... it's not much easier now.

1092
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:48,929
I think I found what painting means, at least for me.

1093
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:53,642
To fly, you don't chant a spell or something, right?

1094
01:27:54,738 --> 01:27:55,510
Mm.

1095
01:27:55,530 --> 01:27:56,302
We fly with our spirit.

1096
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:57,804
The witch's spirit?

1097
01:27:57,824 --> 01:27:58,888
Perfect!

1098
01:27:58,908 --> 01:27:59,972
That's what I'm talking about.

1099
01:28:00,827 --> 01:28:01,807
The spirit of witches.

1100
01:28:01,827 --> 01:28:02,807
The spirit of artists.

1101
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:04,278
The spirit of bakers!

1102
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:08,491
I suppose it must be a power given by God.

1103
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:10,826
Sometimes you suffer for it.

1104
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:15,372
I guess I never gave witchcraft much thought.

1105
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:18,834
That talk about discipline and training was so old-fashioned.

1106
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,630
I was so happy that you came all that way to see me.

1107
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:26,467
Left alone, I would've been one giant ball of frustration.

1108
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:32,264
There have been many times I've thought of painting over that painting.

1109
01:28:33,527 --> 01:28:34,236
Why?

1110
01:28:34,256 --> 01:28:34,965
It's so beautiful.

1111
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:36,852
When I saw you today...

1112
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:39,855
I looked at your sad face and thought, " I've found it!"

1113
01:28:40,534 --> 01:28:41,931
- I knew I could paint you.

1114
01:28:41,951 --> 01:28:43,348
- Not fair!

1115
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:46,487
Sure it is.

1116
01:28:48,375 --> 01:28:49,251
- Let's go to sleep.

1117
01:28:49,271 --> 01:28:50,147
- Okay.

1118
01:28:52,879 --> 01:28:54,256
- Sorry about taking your bed from you.

1119
01:28:54,276 --> 01:28:55,653
- Don't worry about it.

1120
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,709
Can I visit you once in a while?

1121
01:29:00,846 --> 01:29:02,341
Sure.

1122
01:29:02,361 --> 01:29:03,856
Anytime during the summer.

1123
01:29:03,876 --> 01:29:05,371
And I'll try to visit you too.

1124
01:29:11,555 --> 01:29:13,556
The dirigible Freedom Adventurer...

1125
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,391
recently downed in a spectacular forced landing...

1126
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:18,561
due to torrential rains just outside the city limits...

1127
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:20,729
has now been repaired.

1128
01:29:21,157 --> 01:29:22,263
Hello.

1129
01:29:22,283 --> 01:29:23,389
Gutiokipan Bakery.

1130
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,484
Ah, Kiki.

1131
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:30,197
Take plenty of time and get rested up.

1132
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:33,534
That elderly lady you helped has another job for you.

1133
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:35,494
Should I tell her no?

1134
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:39,582
I've told her you'd be away for some time, but she kept insisting.

1135
01:29:40,468 --> 01:29:42,012
Then stop on your way back.

1136
01:29:42,032 --> 01:29:43,576
Bye.

1137
01:30:02,949 --> 01:30:04,013
- Afternoon, ma'am.

1138
01:30:04,033 --> 01:30:05,097
- Well, well.

1139
01:30:05,243 --> 01:30:06,223
We've been expecting you.

1140
01:30:06,243 --> 01:30:07,223
Come in.

1141
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:13,866
There are less than five minutes to takeoff now.

1142
01:30:15,837 --> 01:30:17,318
- Very nice to see you again, ma'am.

1143
01:30:17,338 --> 01:30:18,819
- I'm glad you came.

1144
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:23,918
Excuse me for not standing, but my legs are bothering me more than usual.

1145
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:25,127
Bertha, bring the package.

1146
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:26,962
Yes!

1147
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,756
I hope it hasn't taken off yet.

1148
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:30,132
Not yet.

1149
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:33,469
Bertha's absolutely mad about lighter-than-air travel.

1150
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:35,512
I'm the adventuresome type.

1151
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:38,766
Turn the volume down.

1152
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:42,144
Kiki, would you open the box?

1153
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:43,687
Yes.

1154
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:52,404
What's this?

1155
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:55,532
Would you please deliver it to a girl named Kiki?

1156
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,701
She was kind and a tremendous help.

1157
01:30:58,161 --> 01:30:59,703
It's my "thank you".

1158
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:03,707
And would you find out when her next birthday might be?

1159
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:07,127
Then I'll be able to bake her another one.

1160
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:13,425
Kiki.

1161
01:31:16,815 --> 01:31:18,838
I will.

1162
01:31:18,858 --> 01:31:20,881
And I'm sure Kiki will want to know the lady's birthday...

1163
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:23,352
so she'll be able to give her a present.

1164
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:25,688
You've got a deal.

1165
01:31:39,504 --> 01:31:40,922
- What happened?

1166
01:31:40,942 --> 01:31:42,360
- There's been a terrible catastrophe.

1167
01:31:42,507 --> 01:31:44,009
Oh, no!

1168
01:31:44,029 --> 01:31:45,531
The ropes holding the blimp are breaking!

1169
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:47,543
It's drifting straight toward our television cameras.

1170
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,420
My God, it's going to...

1171
01:31:52,434 --> 01:31:54,311
Oh!

1172
01:31:54,331 --> 01:31:56,208
They always leave me hanging at the most exciting part!

1173
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:59,513
These winds always come in midsummer.

1174
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:01,557
They'll be hitting us pretty soon.

1175
01:32:05,905 --> 01:32:06,844
It'll pass by quickly.

1176
01:32:06,864 --> 01:32:07,803
Don't worry.

1177
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:09,648
Oh, goody, it's back on.

1178
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:15,612
It's completely upside-down!

1179
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:18,657
The Freedom Adventurer has been shaken by great winds...

1180
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,535
It's like a balloon in that position.

1181
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:25,831
It has broken loose from its mooring and drifted into an upside-down position.

1182
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:31,670
A desperate, last-ditch effort is being made to tie the dirigible down and keep it from drifting away.

1183
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,441
It's extremely doubtful whether it can be done...

1184
01:32:34,461 --> 01:32:36,262
Oh, no!

1185
01:32:36,282 --> 01:32:38,083
It's useless!

1186
01:32:38,428 --> 01:32:41,180
That's my friend Tombo holding on to that rope!

1187
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:45,768
...attached to the end of the cable as though it were a toy!

1188
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:48,103
There's a young boy hanging on to the cable!

1189
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:51,523
He's being lifted away along with the police car!

1190
01:32:51,701 --> 01:32:53,286
I don't believe what I'm seeing!

1191
01:32:53,306 --> 01:32:54,891
Oh, the humanity!

1192
01:32:55,288 --> 01:32:56,748
- Are you sure it's your friend?

1193
01:32:56,768 --> 01:32:58,228
- I have to go!

1194
01:32:58,374 --> 01:32:59,216
- Be careful!

1195
01:32:59,236 --> 01:33:00,078
- Oh, dear.

1196
01:33:00,098 --> 01:33:00,940
What's happening?

1197
01:33:25,735 --> 01:33:27,132
Hold on there, son!

1198
01:33:27,152 --> 01:33:28,549
Just hold your grip steady!

1199
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:30,479
Release the helium from the tail!

1200
01:33:57,183 --> 01:33:59,040
All citizens are requested to remain calm.

1201
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:00,917
Do not panic.

1202
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:03,804
The helium inside the dirigible will not explode.

1203
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:06,098
Tombo.

1204
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:09,059
Any word about the boy hanging on the rope?

1205
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:12,604
The latest report was that the police car dropped into a pool!

1206
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:27,777
Clear the street!

1207
01:34:27,797 --> 01:34:28,694
Get on the sidewalk!

1208
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:30,956
Do not block the street!

1209
01:34:35,795 --> 01:34:37,421
Are you feeling all right?

1210
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,928
Please, sir, may I borrow your broom?

1211
01:34:45,398 --> 01:34:46,650
- Huh?

1212
01:34:46,670 --> 01:34:47,922
- I promise I'll bring it right back.

1213
01:34:48,067 --> 01:34:49,152
- Well, I suppose that's okay.

1214
01:34:49,172 --> 01:34:50,257
- Thank you very much!

1215
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:28,847
Fly.

1216
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:33,143
Oh, my goodness!

1217
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:03,298
Straighten up and fly right, or I'll burn you!

1218
01:36:10,807 --> 01:36:12,266
The boy appears safe...

1219
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:15,310
but the dirigible is on a collision course directly for the clock tower.

1220
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,229
If the wind doesn't shift direction...

1221
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:20,941
the Freedom Adventurer will surely smash into the tower!

1222
01:36:22,537 --> 01:36:23,914
We gotta get up higher!

1223
01:36:23,934 --> 01:36:25,311
We're gonna hit the tower!

1224
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:27,155
There's not enough helium!

1225
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,616
Before we hit, jump onto the tower!

1226
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:31,159
Aye, aye, Captain!

1227
01:36:31,296 --> 01:36:32,054
Hey there!

1228
01:36:32,074 --> 01:36:32,832
Over here!

1229
01:36:32,852 --> 01:36:33,610
Come on!

1230
01:36:33,798 --> 01:36:35,238
- Get out of the way!

1231
01:36:35,258 --> 01:36:36,698
- Grab hold of this!

1232
01:36:54,027 --> 01:36:54,611
That way!

1233
01:36:54,631 --> 01:36:55,215
Hurry!

1234
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:57,144
Don't you dare!

1235
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:14,369
That sound is the helium gas leaking.

1236
01:37:14,505 --> 01:37:15,500
The condition of the boy is unknown.

1237
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,515
From where I'm standing...

1238
01:37:16,535 --> 01:37:17,530
Oh, no!

1239
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:25,672
Too much gas has escaped, and it's falling!

1240
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,643
It's snagged on another building!

1241
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:39,747
- Hey, look!

1242
01:37:39,767 --> 01:37:40,734
Over there!

1243
01:37:40,754 --> 01:37:41,721
- It's a miracle!

1244
01:37:41,898 --> 01:37:43,982
The boy has managed to keep hold of the rope!

1245
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:46,985
But how can anyone rescue him now?

1246
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:49,780
That boy is hanging on for dear life.

1247
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:51,782
Something just flew by!

1248
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:52,866
Is it a bird?

1249
01:37:53,002 --> 01:37:54,775
No, no, it's a girl!

1250
01:37:54,795 --> 01:37:56,568
A witch!

1251
01:37:56,913 --> 01:37:59,581
Yes, there is a young girl soaring through the sky!

1252
01:38:00,093 --> 01:38:00,823
Wow!

1253
01:38:00,843 --> 01:38:01,573
Go, Kiki!

1254
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:03,085
She can fly now!

1255
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:04,336
Get 'em!

1256
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:06,421
Tombo!

1257
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:08,090
Kiki!

1258
01:38:10,728 --> 01:38:12,105
Come on!

1259
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:13,502
Be a good broom and help me out!

1260
01:38:14,607 --> 01:38:15,400
Hang on, young fella!

1261
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:16,213
Don't give up!

1262
01:38:16,442 --> 01:38:17,819
Hold on!

1263
01:38:17,839 --> 01:38:19,216
She's almost there!

1264
01:38:20,061 --> 01:38:21,311
Tombo!

1265
01:38:22,188 --> 01:38:23,271
Kiki!

1266
01:38:29,288 --> 01:38:30,018
Hold on!

1267
01:38:30,038 --> 01:38:30,768
Don't give up now!

1268
01:38:33,491 --> 01:38:34,741
Don't give up, son.

1269
01:38:38,965 --> 01:38:40,342
Don't give up!

1270
01:38:40,362 --> 01:38:41,739
Don't give up!

1271
01:38:49,851 --> 01:38:51,644
She caught him in midair!

1272
01:38:51,664 --> 01:38:53,457
I've never seen anything so amazing!

1273
01:39:11,330 --> 01:39:13,020
They've landed safely.

1274
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,730
What a sight to see!

1275
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:16,658
Everyone onboard appears to be fine.

1276
01:39:16,919 --> 01:39:18,046
That broom is mine.

1277
01:39:18,066 --> 01:39:19,193
I gave it to her myself.

1278
01:39:20,339 --> 01:39:21,466
She did it!

1279
01:39:21,486 --> 01:39:22,613
She did it!

1280
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:25,125
You're so brave, Kiki.

1281
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:26,835
