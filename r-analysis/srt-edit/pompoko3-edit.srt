00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:15,676
A Studio Ghibli Film Tokuma Shoten Publishing Nippon TV Hakuhodo Studio Ghibli present Raccoon, Raccoon, Will you come out and play?

2
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,611
l can't, l'm eating right now.

3
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,748
What are you eating?

4
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:25,358
Pickled plums and radish.

5
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,989
Can l have a bite?

6
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:46,008
POM POKO THE GREAT RACCOON BATTLE We used to live near the humans.

7
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,243
But no, not to swipe their food.

8
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:56,582
Where there are farms and fields, There are always frogs and grasshoppers and mice and moles.

9
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,358
And persimmon and mulberry seeds.

10
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:02,322
Much more food than in the mountains.

11
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:07,856
Then suddenly last spring the house became vacant.

12
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:13,400
We decided to move in and make it our nest.

13
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:27,311
lt was a truly wonderful year.

14
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:32,024
A house with a garden, it was like a dream!

15
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,086
Until one day...

16
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:51,036
Usually we don't have any strict rules about our territory.

17
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,002
But this was different.

18
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:57,071
Wherever we went for food, we'd always butt heads with others.

19
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:02,047
There were fights, our house was captured, And finally...

20
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:06,016
Pom Poko year 31 , autumn.

21
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:10,120
Deforestation began in TAKAGA Forest.

22
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:15,557
And the Raccoons of the Tama Hills faced their ultimate battle.

23
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:48,700
Commander of the Red Army was Gonta of Takaga Forest.

24
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:53,698
Commander of the Blue Army was Seizaemon of Suzuka Forest.

25
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:07,109
Not many people know this, but when humans aren't looking, all raccoons stand on 2 feet.

26
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,599
The battle was brave and intense but it didn't go on very long.

27
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:06,475
Go, go!

28
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:07,715
Takaga Forest!

29
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:08,955
Go, go!

30
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:10,195
Suzuka Forest!

31
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,852
Red or Blue, whoever wins they both will lose.

32
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,089
The loser will be killed.

33
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:22,483
lf the Red dies today, the Blue will die tomorrow.

34
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,988
Too many raccoons with no place to live.

35
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,757
Where will they go?

36
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:30,422
There is no place.

37
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:31,719
They'll all die.

38
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:37,499
Whoever wins, Red or Blue, they both lose.

39
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:41,574
For the sake of all, they'll be killed.

40
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:46,046
lf they don't all die, the survivors must not mate.

41
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,484
No more children.

42
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:55,854
Or else there won't be enough forest to hold them.

43
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:06,703
At the demand of wild Granny Oroku, the raccoons looked down at the earth and they were stunned.

44
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,941
The mountain had completely vanished.

45
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,039
The hills were stripped and flattened.

46
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,643
lt now looked so vast and cold.

47
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,941
This is insane!

48
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,046
This is no time for fighting!

49
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:31,255
ln the height of Japan's economic growth, there were increasing demands for new housing around Tokyo.

50
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:38,834
Chaotic development began in the farmlands and mountains.

51
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:44,839
This development was known since 1966 as the Tama New Town project.

52
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:50,172
Total area: 3000 hectares, Proposed population: 300,000 people.

53
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,548
The mountain was deforested, stripped and the hills leveled flat.

54
00:05:54,764 --> 00:05:56,444
Farms were bulldozed.

55
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:58,144
Old housed were demolished.

56
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:02,823
The Tama Hills became a residential development area.

57
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:08,226
PShrubs and trees were added to create a spacious new bedroom community.

58
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,034
The largest urban development ever.

59
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,741
Wow, humans are really amazing.

60
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,241
l always thought all animals were the same.

61
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:28,877
But now l think humans must be as powerful as Buddha and his disciples.

62
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,318
lt was a state of emergency.

63
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,164
A meeting was called one night in the old temple.

64
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:44,028
All the raccoons in the forest came.

65
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:51,741
The chairman was the 105 year old priest, Reverend Tsurukame.

66
00:06:52,745 --> 00:07:04,289
Given the dire situation, we must all start taking action during the daytime as needed, while continuing our nocturnal habits.

67
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:09,387
They decided their course of action would be to prevent development.

68
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:19,331
The agreement is unanimous!' Realizing the danger they were in, they broke up the meeting at once.

69
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,832
All future decisions would be made by the council of chiefs.

70
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:29,906
The chiefs decided on a 5-year plan to bring back the old art of metamorphosis and to study human beings.

71
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:38,319
They decided to summons the famous masters of 'morphing' from Shikoku and Sado, to be their teachers of transformation.

72
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:46,324
But nobody would volunteer to be the messenger on the long journey.

73
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,894
They all pretended to be asleep.

74
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:56,942
Our only hope is to wait for the young raccoons to grow up, and send them.

75
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,472
Agreed!

76
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:10,188
Getting down to business, they proceeded with their research of MacDonald's hamburgers and then ended the meeting.

77
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:35,244
No Dumping ln order to gather thorough research on humans, They set up a TV at headquarters to catch hourly information.

78
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,721
Good evening.

79
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,888
Good evening.

80
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,956
The TV aroused great interest.

81
00:08:54,567 --> 00:09:02,165
Raccoons came to headquarters without official business just to watch the TV all day.

82
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:09,972
'Metamorphosis' is the most extreme concentration of mind and spirit.

83
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:15,352
To reform the body cells in a split second is the world's greatest miracle.

84
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:20,054
Lower animal like chameleons use 'mimicry'.

85
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:26,094
But true transformation can only be done by raccoons, foxes, and some cats.

86
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,258
Hey, Gonta!

87
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,536
Look how you did that.

88
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:37,237
You're already learning the first steps of transforming.

89
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,007
Once you get the hang of it, anyone can do it ...

90
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,210
...at least in theory.

91
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,787
l'll give you a demonstration.

92
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:52,789
Aren't you supposed to put a leaf on your head?

93
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,789
That's only for beginners.

94
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,470
lt's been awhile.

95
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:15,311
With Granny Oroku as their teacher the revival of metamorphosis was well under way.

96
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:22,350
All the youngsters were eager to learn and practice their new skill.

97
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,055
Excellent, Shokichi!

98
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,166
l've always been interested in humans.

99
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:48,272
We're not supposed to get too close to them but my father, who passed away, never stopped me.

100
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:53,884
A good knowledge of humans is the foundation of the art of transformation.

101
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,146
Dad knew it would be useful in the future.

102
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,407
Of course, not all the students were brilliant.

103
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,582
ln fact, many were totally awful.

104
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:33,015
The key to transformation is extreme discipline of mind and body.

105
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:37,652
This is easy for a fox, but raccoons are so naturally easygoing.

106
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,031
As expected, there were some dropouts.

107
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,032
Hey!

108
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,598
Hey, Ponkichi!

109
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:57,414
Ready, set, let's all transform...

110
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:06,117
l was so into morphing that l couldn't believe that my friend Ponkichi just wanted to live an ordinary raccoon's life.

111
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:14,489
At dusk on a mountain pass, the moon comes out from behind the mountain.

112
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:19,433
Then a branch from a cedar tree obstructs the view of the moon.

113
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:29,637
'Funny', the person says, 'there was no branch there before.' Then the branch disappears and comes out on the other side.

114
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:40,350
The human who sees this says, 'No, there were branches on each side.' Then a branch comes out on the other side too.

115
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,627
Just then, BOOM, it falls down.

116
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,296
Do you know what fell?

117
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,294
A raccoon!

118
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:49,040
'That's right.

119
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,524
And why did it fall?

120
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:51,298
Gonta?

121
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,107
'Cause he was stupid.

122
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:54,654
There's no way l would fall.

123
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:56,064
Good.

124
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:57,031
That's the spirit.

125
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,141
Sasuke, why did he fall?

126
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,705
He made his arms into branches and forgot to hold on to the tree.

127
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,505
Very good.

128
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:06,870
And what is the lesson to be learned here?

129
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,235
Shokichi?

130
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,548
That you shouldn't listen to everything humans say.

131
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:13,786
Right.

132
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,032
We raccoons let ourselves go too easily.

133
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:19,581
We give them too much.

134
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,653
This is the source of our mistakes.

135
00:13:21,673 --> 00:13:23,484
Does everyone understand?

136
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,270
Yes, Reverend Tsurukame.

137
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:31,636
So, for example, if l sing: Raccoon, raccoon, Will you come out to play?

138
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:36,144
We're in the middle of our lessons.

139
00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:36,868
See?

140
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:37,031
You've already fallen for it.

141
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:37,194
That's what l was afraid of.

142
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:02,198
While the raccoons were still hard at work on their studies, winter had come and gone.

143
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,579
The plum trees were blossoming.

144
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:06,627
The season for love was here.

145
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:16,720
Following Granny Okura's orders, Many of the raccoons abstained from mating to keep the population under control.

146
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,158
Especially the females.

147
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:27,765
They controlled their maternal instincts with firm integrity, rejecting the lovesick wooing of the males.

148
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:36,770
Meanwhile, the work progressed on the massive development.

149
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,372
As more forest disappeared, the clear land for housing expanded.

150
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,114
The raccoons were sad and angry.

151
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,815
They called the site the 'flat hills'.

152
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,516
Mr. mailman, you dropped something... a postcard. l'll get it for you.

153
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:59,353
The females, who were all raised as liberated raccoons, also learned to transform along with the males.

154
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:06,295
When males transform into girls, The voices and gestures can cause difficulties.

155
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,506
The females help solve these problems.

156
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:15,309
Some females also transformed into men.

157
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,913
Can l have just the boys stay after class for a moment?

158
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:28,554
One day the Reverend Tsurukame gave the boys a special lecture.

159
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:35,299
Boys, there's something hidden in the mat you're sitting on.

160
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:40,163
What is that? lt's my golden balls!

161
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:43,164
16 square yards.

162
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:45,132
Here's your proof.

163
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:02,625
After completing transformation class the students began to train on street.

164
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:13,928
Like when learning to drive, one must be accompanied by an experienced driver, to prevent accidents like detection.

165
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:49,197
The art of transformation requires a great deal of energy.

166
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,375
Especially when transforming into humans.

167
00:16:53,379 --> 00:17:00,251
The dark circles raccoons have around their eyes are from their sheer fatigue.

168
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:08,257
Even an experienced raccoon will need to take along some extra energy.

169
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:14,523
Pf they're too exhausted, they could change back to raccoons in an instant.

170
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:22,674
Recently, those energy drinks have done very well on the market.

171
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:32,481
To graduate from practical training, each student had to peacefully and single-handedly bring back $10.

172
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,050
Help me!

173
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,687
Some of them transformed into workmen.

174
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:42,621
Others posed as begging monks.

175
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:48,032
Some of the females tried working at bars.

176
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,965
One even tried his luck at pachinko.

177
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,868
One tricky fellow got his paws on the donation box at the temple.

178
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,776
But all he got was small change.

179
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,672
Granny Oroku could easily detect fake money.

180
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,986
l told you never to counterfeit money out of leaves!

181
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:19,927
Gonta's training at headquarters was interrupted by an urgent report.

182
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:23,357
He rushed back to his forest and was enraged by what he saw.

183
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:28,738
More than half of his forest had been leveled to 'flat hills'.

184
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,705
Furious, he hurried back to HQ.

185
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:41,479
He called a meeting of the counsel and proposed aggressive tactics to drive back the humans.

186
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:45,616
Why?

187
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:49,691
The time is not ripe. lt's only the 1st year of the 5 year plan.

188
00:18:49,972 --> 00:18:51,835
Pe've all completed our training.

189
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:53,718
We're already capable of great things.

190
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,458
What do you think, Granny?

191
00:18:56,478 --> 00:18:58,927
Can we send them out yet?

192
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,400
They are certainly capable of the basic skills.

193
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,573
Are they?

194
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:07,814
But they lack the experience.

195
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:10,595
There is still danger of critical error.

196
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,073
l want to ask Gonta.

197
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:21,455
Son, are you proposing this battle for your own personal revenge?

198
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,991
No, l swear. lt's for the total happiness of all the raccoons in Tama.

199
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,569
Total happiness?

200
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,794
You forget, Gonta.

201
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:35,728
A year ago you were fighting against Suzuka Forest.

202
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:36,941
You were the leader.

203
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:39,684
Shut up!

204
00:19:39,704 --> 00:19:41,969
Even if you're all against me, We raccoons from Takaga Forest are going to fight.

205
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,075
lf Gonta's going to fight, then l'm going too.

206
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,883
You too, Shokichi?

207
00:19:47,496 --> 00:19:50,508
Thanks!

208
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:53,540
Men, there's no turning back now!

209
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:55,988
Hey, wait!

210
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,156
You can't stop us, Granny.

211
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,726
Just this one time, l'll teach you a secret skill.

212
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:13,511
Even if you mess up, this disguise will last five days.

213
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,076
O.K., what is it?

214
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,016
A dead fox.

215
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:21,541
32nd year of Pom Poko.

216
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:23,441
Summer.

217
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:30,993
Gonta and his group of supporters began to risk their lives in a surprise attack on the humans.

218
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,928
At the same time, a counter-attack had started.

219
00:20:46,655 --> 00:20:48,302
-They've come!

220
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:49,969
-They're here!

221
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,907
Come on!

222
00:20:55,927 --> 00:20:57,204
Come on!

223
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:05,002
We did it!

224
00:21:05,022 --> 00:21:05,952
We did it!

225
00:21:51,043 --> 00:22:05,786
Today at 2:30pm at the development site of Tama New Town, Three drivers were killed and two more were seriously injured in a landslide and an accident involving a trailer.

226
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:11,325
One building under construction was completely razed in this disaster.

227
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,730
Heavy rains and poor visibility were blamed for the accident.

228
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:19,731
Because so many accidents have occurred at the development sites,.

229
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:26,602
nearby residents are questioning the integrity of New Town's construction.

230
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,610
Wait a minute!

231
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,012
Those people were victims of this war.

232
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:41,920
We should express our deepest condolences to those poor humans.

233
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,921
The Reverend is right.

234
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:50,293
Let's have one minute of silent prayer for the victims' sacrifices.

235
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:51,861
Aye!

236
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,894
-Silent prayer!

237
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:53,628
Silent prayer!

238
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,772
-Silent prayer!

239
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:14,021
-We won!

240
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,395
We won!

241
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:16,769
-Let's celebrate!

242
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:18,143
A big party!

243
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,416
Hey!

244
00:23:48,436 --> 00:23:49,383
Gonta!

245
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,296
Our heroes have triumphantly returned.

246
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,628
You did a great job, Shokichi.

247
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:06,975
Thanks to you, we're full of hope.

248
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,203
Heck, today was only a test.

249
00:24:09,223 --> 00:24:10,437
The real battle hasn't even begun yet.

250
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,417
Each of us can take on a few humans at a time.

251
00:24:16,865 --> 00:24:18,341
Crush, kill and destroy them.

252
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:19,837
Kick them out of our domain!

253
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,786
We mustn't fail!

254
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,354
Say something, Shokichi.

255
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,370
And then we'll plant trees!

256
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,754
Lots of persimmon trees!

257
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:38,874
Hurry, persimmon seed, sprout a tree lf you don't l'll chop you up.

258
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:41,458
Out with the humans!

259
00:24:41,478 --> 00:24:43,081
Kill them!

260
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:44,704
Destroy them!

261
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,807
PHold on.

262
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:50,674
Aren't we supposed to be celebrating this joyous day together?

263
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:53,008
-l'm a little worried about something.

264
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:54,270
- What's that?

265
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:58,492
Are we going to kill all the humans and drive them all out?

266
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,692
Of course!

267
00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:01,554
Can't we let a few humans stay?

268
00:25:01,574 --> 00:25:03,187
Like it was before?

269
00:25:03,478 --> 00:25:04,736
No!

270
00:25:04,756 --> 00:25:06,014
They're our blood enemy!

271
00:25:06,034 --> 00:25:07,292
They're monsters!

272
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,900
They must be banished forever!

273
00:25:10,185 --> 00:25:15,467
l guess you're right. l hate them too.

274
00:25:15,487 --> 00:25:20,769
There are some good ones, but...

275
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,314
But what?

276
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:29,226
But if we drive them all away, we'll never eat tempura again.

277
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:31,886
-Or sardines ...or corn...

278
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,587
-Hamburgers!

279
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:35,288
Donuts!

280
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:36,989
Fried chicken!

281
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:38,376
Potato chips!

282
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:39,360
Turkey!

283
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:43,497
Aw, rats. l want those things too!

284
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:48,106
What if we let just a few humans stay?

285
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,440
l suppose we have no choice.

286
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,487
-Oh, good!

287
00:25:53,507 --> 00:25:55,034
-Hooray for Gonta!

288
00:25:56,454 --> 00:26:06,887
ln the garden of our temple The moon shines bright.

289
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:12,165
Everyone come out, come out Hurry, hurry, all our friends.

290
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,395
Reverend Tsurukame, come out!

291
00:26:14,415 --> 00:26:16,363
Everybody look at Granny!

292
00:26:16,985 --> 00:26:19,064
You gotta get a look!

293
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:21,163
Everyone's gotta get a look!

294
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:34,823
Authorities declare that need for housing for over 1 million people is too urgent to consider delaying the New Town development.

295
00:26:35,103 --> 00:26:36,146
-Hey...

296
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:37,209
-What did they say?

297
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,798
lt was an unfortunate accident.

298
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:49,370
The hero, Gonta suffered compound fractures and ruptured organs.

299
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,303
He would need at least a year to recover fully.

300
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:59,575
The incoming news threw a sheet of gloom over the celebration.

301
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:06,117
But they were encouraged by the local people's superstitions.

302
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:11,521
Perhaps they've been cursed for tearing down the Suwa Shrine.

303
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,055
What do you mean?

304
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,835
They're being punished.

305
00:27:15,855 --> 00:27:18,315
The gods are striking back.

306
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,232
Weren't all the statues of deities saved?

307
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:25,933
Of course.

308
00:27:25,953 --> 00:27:29,369
We held a proper ceremony before moving them out, but..

309
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,144
What do you think, Professor Mizuki?

310
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:37,845
These gods are the original guardians of that land.

311
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:41,513
Of course they're angry.

312
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:44,079
Any god would be.

313
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,327
l think there will be much more punishment to come.

314
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,065
Hikage Mountain might be saved.

315
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:05,415
Shokichi launched a new strategy.

316
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:22,966
When the owner of the land went to check the area with the agent, Phe was bewildered to see several statues of deities on Hikage Mountain.

317
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,700
So he delayed the contract.

318
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:41,116
At another shrine that was to be moved, Kumataro disrupted the rituals by transforming into the legendary fox, messenger to the gods.

319
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:46,389
He appeared on the roof and caused a commotion.

320
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:50,354
The move of the shrine was postponed.

321
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:55,361
lnstead, they requested the authorities to change the road plans.

322
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,701
The raccoons were all very excited.

323
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:10,977
Each group was driven by competition.

324
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:15,951
They had all mastered the art of transformation and they began various guerrilla attacks.

325
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,417
Come over here!

326
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,151
Give it up!

327
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,329
Take it away!

328
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:34,307
-Let's not leave anything behind.

329
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:37,288
-Leave the food!

330
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,174
What's wrong young lady?

331
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,589
Hey, what's the matter?

332
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:11,266
A faceless ghost!

333
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:43,325
-Over there... there was...

334
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:45,054
-A murder?

335
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:46,999
-NO...

336
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:48,632
-Not a murder?

337
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:52,803
-lt was a woman.

338
00:30:52,823 --> 00:30:55,101
-The wide-mouth monster lady?

339
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,116
No, it was...

340
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:03,225
Was it something like this?

341
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:24,842
Was it... something like this?

342
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:37,888
They were having so much fun spooking the humans so easily.

343
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,661
They all had a big party.

344
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:52,209
Nevertheless, the hero, Gonta was disappointed that his injuries were not healing quickly.

345
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:58,215
Pis dear wife, Otama, nursed him well, but he was still unable to fight.

346
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:02,719
He wasn't pleased with the way the others were handling things.

347
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:08,114
Last night's news was great! 'New Town is Ghost Town'.

348
00:32:08,403 --> 00:32:10,863
That cop was on the show.

349
00:32:10,883 --> 00:32:13,343
They all laughed at him.

350
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,130
He turned bright red and got mad. lt was so funny.

351
00:32:18,446 --> 00:32:19,973
What are you idiots doing?

352
00:32:19,993 --> 00:32:21,520
How will that stop their work?

353
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:28,403
lf you're going to transform, do it to kill the humans!

354
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,210
Just as Gonta said, the construction didn't stop.

355
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:41,420
The river was banked with concrete.

356
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,322
Roads cut through the flattened hills.

357
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,962
And construction of housing was under way.

358
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:57,766
However, the mysterious incidents received so much media coverage that the New Town hauntings were famous all over the country.

359
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,511
The raccoons morale lifted higher and higher.

360
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:11,829
32nd year of Pom Poko.

361
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:13,313
Autumn.

362
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:19,623
lt was a big game to decide who would be the messengers to bring back the great Masters of metamorphosis.

363
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:23,392
Tamasaburo would go to Shikoku.

364
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,196
And Bunta would go to Sado.

365
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:41,881
At the next full moon, the two were sent off on their far mission.

366
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:03,903
After the messengers left, the youngsters continued spooking.

367
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:17,711
Whether or not it contributed to stopping the development, it was their favorite game.

368
00:34:33,314 --> 00:34:33,870
-Out with the devil!

369
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:34,446
-Hey...

370
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:35,022
Papa!

371
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:04,767
Can we really chase the humans away by doing these tricks?

372
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:10,470
lf we fail, will they see through our disguises?

373
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:15,445
Should we fight like Gonta says?

374
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,574
No, killing 1 or 2 people won't make any difference.

375
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:24,444
To be or not to be...

376
00:35:24,464 --> 00:35:27,379
That is the question.

377
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:43,829
Okiyo, what are you doing over there?

378
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,038
ls something wrong with your neck?

379
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:56,580
l'm posing. l thought you might say l'm pretty.

380
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:57,548
-0h, sorry.

381
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:00,010
-Now my neck really does hurt.

382
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,075
-That was pretty.

383
00:36:02,837 --> 00:36:04,114
-Too late.

384
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:05,411
-But l mean it.

385
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,927
l'm just rusty, that's all.

386
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:28,947
Everyone likes that song... l guess l like it too.

387
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,009
Do you like 'Where are you from?' -Yeah, but nobody sings it.

388
00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:34,808
-That song...

389
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:41,190
A raccoon was on Senba Mountain, And along came a hunter...

390
00:36:41,642 --> 00:36:44,290
-My grandpa was killed by a gun.

391
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,958
-Sorry, l didn't know.

392
00:36:47,682 --> 00:36:51,866
But he wasn't cooked and eaten.

393
00:36:51,886 --> 00:36:56,070
His fur was sold for a lot of money.

394
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:59,113
Your fur is beautiful too.

395
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,447
l'm happy you said that, Shokichi.

396
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,684
So what about that song?

397
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,769
Oh yeah, my dad used to sing it.

398
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:14,488
He was a good ball bouncer too.

399
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:17,233
He must have been a character.

400
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:23,967
And when he finished singing, he would always start preaching.

401
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,505
What did he say?

402
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:29,889
Children, you must never forget.

403
00:37:29,909 --> 00:37:34,012
Like the song says, the true nature of humans is cruel.

404
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:38,135
That they kill us and eat us.

405
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,717
Hey, let's play ball.

406
00:37:45,006 --> 00:37:46,067
-Are you any good?

407
00:37:46,087 --> 00:37:47,148
-Sure l am.

408
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,901
OK., l got one too.

409
00:38:00,688 --> 00:38:01,935
Where are you from?

410
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:03,202
Higo...

411
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:04,469
Where's Higo?

412
00:38:04,892 --> 00:38:07,474
Kumamoto...

413
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,076
Where's Kumamoto?

414
00:38:10,096 --> 00:38:12,678
Senba...There's raccoons there.

415
00:38:13,634 --> 00:38:17,112
-So, when is Operation Twin Star?

416
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:20,610
-Oh, l don't really want to do it.

417
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:23,389
-But it was such a great idea.

418
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:25,556
-Yeah.

419
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,627
-Do you want to do it tonight?

420
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:29,294
-With you?

421
00:38:30,251 --> 00:38:32,080
Yeah, we can be partners.

422
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,929
Are you scared?

423
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:37,922
-No, it's not that, but...

424
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:40,875
-O.K., so we'll go. lt'll be great.

425
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:44,849
O.K. let's do it. l'm sure that with you, it'll be a success.

426
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:46,318
Great!

427
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,003
My, what adorable little children.

428
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:05,806
We just got back from our space travels and now we're lost.

429
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,769
Space travels?

430
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:17,812
From the red-eyed scorpion, we crossed over the eagle's wings We looped the coiled snake, to the top of the bear cub's brow.

431
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:23,026
And we sprinkled the dew and frost.

432
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:27,559
What in the world ...are you two?

433
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:31,722
-We're lost and we're cold!

434
00:39:31,742 --> 00:39:34,555
-Mister, do you know our house?

435
00:39:34,982 --> 00:39:37,541
-We don't know.

436
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:40,120
Now go away!

437
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,699
-We'd better call the police!

438
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,887
-They're not kids, They're goblins!

439
00:39:44,907 --> 00:39:46,804
-Goblins!

440
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:09,044
Forgive us!

441
00:40:09,064 --> 00:40:12,662
Forgive us, little goblins!

442
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:36,337
Wait a minute.

443
00:40:36,357 --> 00:40:37,986
We can make a deal.

444
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,737
l'll raise your wages. l'm asking you to stay.

445
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,872
No way, l can't take any more. l'm going back home.

446
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,769
This place gives me the creeps.

447
00:40:47,054 --> 00:40:47,933
Please, don't say that!

448
00:40:47,953 --> 00:40:48,832
Mr.

449
00:40:48,852 --> 00:40:49,731
Suzuki.

450
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:54,713
l knew Tokyo was a scary place but this is too much.

451
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:58,011
l think you should drop this whole development.

452
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:02,123
Curse or no curse, Someone is against this thing.

453
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,900
The raccoons cheered.

454
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,235
That night's party was especially grand.

455
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:20,035
The heroes of the day were Okiyo and Shokichi.

456
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:29,349
The workers had deserted. lt was dead calm.

457
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:44,033
But the next morning... all the replacements arrived After all their hard work at spooking them out, sure enough, new people came the very next day.

458
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:49,902
A local rumor says the spooks are only foxes or raccoons.

459
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:57,379
lf that were true, all we'd need to do is kill the guilty animals.

460
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:01,279
This made the raccoons at Headquarters very nervous.

461
00:42:01,529 --> 00:42:04,308
But this is just like the old tales.

462
00:42:04,328 --> 00:42:07,107
That's how the rumor got started.

463
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,383
That just proves that it's only a vicious rumor.

464
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,632
Vicious rumor?

465
00:42:11,652 --> 00:42:13,714
We saw it with our own eyes!

466
00:42:13,974 --> 00:42:15,621
Very well.

467
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:17,288
We have decided to exterminate these animals.

468
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:28,406
As soon as we find them, you'll have your proof.

469
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:39,922
Shokichi wasn't the only one who was skeptical of their efforts to spook the humans away.

470
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:44,288
As you know, in the Edo era, the raccoons reigned.

471
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:52,426
The art of metamorphosis was at its peak lt was a theme of all painters and writers in that period.

472
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:55,993
But we stood out too much.

473
00:42:56,013 --> 00:42:59,059
The humans were offended.

474
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:08,150
With the progress of civilization, they captured us by the masses for the furriers and the brush makers.

475
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:12,183
This sated their thirst for vengeance.

476
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:17,893
We have never forgotten this painful experience.

477
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:26,969
And we have been discrete with our art in the last few decades, remembering a much more peaceful period.

478
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:37,442
Metamorphosis is a double-edged sword. lt is a great gift, but, used carelessly, it will only fan the flame of humans' hatred.

479
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:39,481
l urge you all to use discretion.

480
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:43,110
The young transforming raccoons felt like they'd missed the point.

481
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:51,221
But it was autumn, the time for abundant harvests.

482
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,487
The best season for raccoons.

483
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,627
To prepare for winter, they ate to store up fat under their fur.

484
00:43:57,001 --> 00:44:00,459
For they must grow their bushy winter coats.

485
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:21,956
The young ones applied their skills to the job of getting food.

486
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:29,966
One day, a tired raccoon arrived at the construction site.

487
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:50,444
lt's O.K., we're raccoons too.

488
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,586
Thank you.

489
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,047
You look awfully tired.

490
00:44:59,067 --> 00:45:01,544
Were did you come from?

491
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,428
From Fujino Mountain.

492
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,669
ls that in Shikoku or Sado?

493
00:45:06,146 --> 00:45:07,890
lt's in Kanagawa.

494
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,654
Back over those mountains.

495
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:12,214
Kanagawa?

496
00:45:12,234 --> 00:45:14,364
You mean you're not from Shikoku?

497
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:19,644
Excuse me, it seems you were expecting something else.

498
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:23,214
lts just that we've been waiting for somebody.

499
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:27,651
Anyway, did you come on certain business?

500
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,252
l finally found it!

501
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,462
l was looking for where all the dirt came from that made a mess of our mountain.

502
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:51,704
According to this raccoon named Hayashi, tons of dirt and construction waste had been unjustly dumped in the hills and valleys of Fujino polluting the rivers, causing frequent landslides, and endangering the survival of the raccoons and other animals.

503
00:45:52,726 --> 00:46:05,198
To find the source of this trouble, Hayashi changed into a human and sneaked onto an empty truck But his transforming skills were not perfect.

504
00:46:05,218 --> 00:46:17,690
He fell into a trance.

505
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,168
And while the truck carried him here, he changed back to himself.

506
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,709
lt's not just Fujino, it's other areas too.

507
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:27,650
The garbage dumpsites, and the golf courses they keep building.

508
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:32,249
They destroy our mountain here, and we are troubled.

509
00:46:32,533 --> 00:46:36,479
Then they dump the waste on Fujino.

510
00:46:36,499 --> 00:46:40,445
And you are troubled Just how far will they go with this insanity?

511
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,457
When l arrived here l was horrified.

512
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:49,468
l thought for sure the waste was coming from the big city.

513
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,707
But this is a mountain!

514
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:56,111
They dig up one mountain and dump it on another.

515
00:46:56,513 --> 00:47:00,142
What in the world for? l don't understand it one bit.

516
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:06,120
Now if we stop the development, we'll also be doing it for Fujino.

517
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:19,125
l can't express it strongly enough. l urge you to use your power for the sake of my mountain as well as your own.

518
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:22,127
Well ...how can we...

519
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:26,042
Where could our messengers have strayed to?

520
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:37,653
And why haven't they brought the masters of metamorphosis here?

521
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:46,558
Winter came without the arrival of the masters.

522
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:56,570
During their winter rest, they forgot about the 'New Town Spooks' for a while, And took a break from their media campaign.

523
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:03,540
The media was now busy with scandals of the singing idols and crimes of the politicians.

524
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:15,551
ln the garden of our temple Raining, raining cotton candy, lce cream, snow cone!

525
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:19,286
All our friends, Pom Poko, Pom!

526
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:27,566
New Year, 33rd year of Pom Poko New Year's morning brought a fresh blanket of snow.

527
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:38,213
People were coming home for the holidays, bringing many gifts, and enjoying long awaited family gatherings.

528
00:48:54,798 --> 00:49:00,634
Raccoon's golden watch lt swings but there's no wind.

529
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:08,139
Baby raccoon sees it And swings his too.

530
00:49:08,789 --> 00:49:10,669
-We really saw them.

531
00:49:10,689 --> 00:49:12,569
-A bunch of raccoons pushed it!

532
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,476
lt's the truth!

533
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:20,712
On New Year's Day, three workers at the Tama development were arrested for a destroying a construction vehicle.

534
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:23,359
The disturbance copycats the infamous 'New Town Spooks'.

535
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:28,223
lnvestigations are under way, but the snow has covered...

536
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:30,627
Look what you've done now, Shokichi.

537
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,833
l don't think we need to worry.

538
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,204
What you did was pointless.

539
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:40,910
Pe was just trying to raise the morale of those who can't yet transform.

540
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,706
What do you think, Reverend?

541
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,950
l think it'll be all right.

542
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,246
And it was all right.

543
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,382
The 3 workers were released on insufficient evidence.

544
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:56,544
The raccoons weren't blamed.

545
00:49:56,564 --> 00:49:58,540
The case remained a mystery.

546
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,269
Then spring finally came.

547
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:16,406
Once again, the season for love.

548
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:22,408
The raccoons, who had been chaste for over a year, had reached the limits of their endurance.

549
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:26,952
Love rivalries and sweet nothings filled the air.

550
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,859
Even the sky was rose-colored.

551
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,925
Wait up, Hanako!

552
00:50:49,322 --> 00:50:51,521
-Hanako, wait!

553
00:50:51,541 --> 00:50:53,740
-You can't catch me!

554
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,755
Everyone has spring fever.

555
00:51:00,033 --> 00:51:03,964
We're just like trees and flowers.

556
00:51:03,984 --> 00:51:07,915
When spring comes, the sun shines We bud, our flowers blossom, then we bear fruit.

557
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:11,858
But we must obey Granny's orders.

558
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:21,405
Until our battle is won, we will be chaste.

559
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:29,383
Shokichi, you... are really great. l'm...so glad.

560
00:51:32,032 --> 00:51:38,462
-Our love is forever.

561
00:51:38,482 --> 00:51:44,912
-Shokichi That was a big mistake.

562
00:51:44,932 --> 00:51:51,362
Their love grew passionate.

563
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:54,735
And sure enough, the others had done the same.

564
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:59,371
That spring, Shokichi and Kiyo had four baby raccoons.

565
00:52:56,106 --> 00:53:04,505
Kincho Daimyo Shrine ln late autumn of the year before, Tamasaburo finally arrived in Awa.

566
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:13,556
He went to the Kincho Shrine, home of the wise Masters, to explain the problem in Tokyo, and ask for the Great One's help.

567
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,156
That's when Tamasaburo fell ill.

568
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:21,597
But with the care of Koharu, the Great One's daughter, he recovered miraculously.

569
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:26,893
That spring the two fell in love and had three babies.

570
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:35,812
Pnside the shrine, all the Masters of Shikoku were in a serious meeting.

571
00:53:36,122 --> 00:53:41,788
They agreed that it was important for all of Japan to stop the development in Tokyo.

572
00:53:41,808 --> 00:53:47,474
They must act quickly.

573
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:50,449
But who should be sent?

574
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,423
And who would run the important affairs here in Shikoku?

575
00:53:54,608 --> 00:54:00,607
Hundreds of questions were raised but no conclusions were reached Father's in the meeting again today.

576
00:54:00,627 --> 00:54:06,626
Always meetings.

577
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,506
And on such a lovely day.

578
00:54:09,756 --> 00:54:13,086
lt's already been 6 months.

579
00:54:13,106 --> 00:54:16,436
When will they reach a decision?

580
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:22,452
l want it to go on forever!

581
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:35,460
l can't stand the thought of you going back to Tama.

582
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:45,875
Koharu, this kind of happiness can only be a dream.

583
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:53,426
But why?

584
00:54:53,446 --> 00:55:00,112
Tama, l'm going to ask Father lf he'll let you stay here and become his successor.

585
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:26,048
While Tamasaburo was wrapped up in the anguish of youth, Bunta, who had journeyed to Sado, roamed the fields and mountains searching for a Master called Danzaburo.

586
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:33,089
But he found to trace of him.

587
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:44,936
From summer to autumn, the raccoons faced a serious dilemma.

588
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:53,838
Not only was their forest disappearing, but their population multiplied with the spring baby boom.

589
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:58,816
Bad weather that summer caused an extreme shortage of food.

590
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:03,752
As expected, persimmons, nuts and autumn harvests were scarce.

591
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:11,232
Transforming raccoons managed to get food from the humans, but it wasn't enough to feed all the babies.

592
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:31,853
Even the non-transforming raccoons were forced to go to the humans' homes to find anything edible.

593
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:36,986
Some of the more careless ones were hit by cars or caught in traps.

594
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:40,990
Many lives were lost.

595
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,892
l'm back in shape now!

596
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,225
lt's time to confront the humans.

597
00:57:22,245 --> 00:57:24,290
Right, Shokichi?

598
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,737
Are you sure you're all right, Gonta?

599
00:57:28,288 --> 00:57:29,451
Of course!

600
00:57:29,471 --> 00:57:30,634
Watch this!

601
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,248
This calls for a celebration!

602
00:57:42,268 --> 00:57:44,216
When's the party?

603
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,363
There's no time for a party, Granny Oroku.

604
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:54,199
l think we should wait until the Elders get here.

605
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,964
You too, Shokichi? l'm sick of you wimps.

606
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:02,040
We mustn't forget the strength of the humans.

607
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:04,769
lf we attack like that, we're sure to lose.

608
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,916
We've already waited too long!

609
00:58:08,161 --> 00:58:09,558
Hold on.

610
00:58:09,578 --> 00:58:10,975
Let's hear Shokichi's opinion.

611
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:20,089
Until the elders arrive, l propose three things: First, fair allotment of the food obtained by transforming raccoons.

612
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,730
ln other words, a rationing system.

613
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:27,902
Second, enforcement of a traffic safety program.

614
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:34,305
Third, a rescue squad for anyone who gets caught in traps.

615
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:40,511
Shokichi, you sound just like a human.

616
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,441
No, l'm very much raccoon.

617
00:58:45,365 --> 00:58:48,212
OK we'll worry about the details later.

618
00:58:48,232 --> 00:58:51,079
For now let's see who agrees.

619
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:53,923
All those in favor raise your hands!

620
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,188
Agreed!

621
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,966
What kind of game are you playing, Gonta?

622
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:01,466
This is not a game! l'm in charge now!

623
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:05,501
Anyone who opposes me will be killed by my guard troop.

624
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,179
Those are dangerous words, Gonta.

625
00:59:11,357 --> 00:59:12,367
Call him Sir!

626
00:59:12,387 --> 00:59:13,397
Gonta, Sir.

627
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:17,075
Humans are strong, indeed.

628
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:20,243
But if we are desperate enough...

629
00:59:20,433 --> 00:59:21,960
We can win.

630
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,507
We can kill them.

631
00:59:24,237 --> 00:59:27,183
The saying goes, 'an angry mouse will eat the cat.' -Cat, schmat!.

632
00:59:27,203 --> 00:59:30,149
-He'll bite his tongue.

633
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,325
We're just cornering ourselves like mice.

634
00:59:33,613 --> 00:59:36,227
Exactly. lf a mouse is cornered, he'll bite the cat.

635
00:59:36,247 --> 00:59:38,861
That's the idea.

636
00:59:39,052 --> 00:59:41,131
-We're not mice.

637
00:59:41,151 --> 00:59:43,230
-Biting a cat won't help us.

638
00:59:43,423 --> 00:59:45,900
Mice?

639
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,397
Yes, a mouse would taste good right now.

640
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:50,950
Mouse tempura is the best.

641
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:54,518
No, fried mouse nuggets are the cats pajamas.

642
00:59:54,867 --> 00:59:57,913
-l like'em with breading.

643
00:59:57,933 --> 01:00:00,979
-l like the crispy fried tails.

644
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,833
What are you all doing?

645
01:00:06,846 --> 01:00:09,442
As for me...

646
01:00:09,462 --> 01:00:12,058
My favorite is mouse tempura.

647
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:14,580
Listen, Gonta.

648
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,161
This is our level of standards.

649
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:21,179
So we will wait for the elders from Shikoku.

650
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:24,476
l'm ashamed.

651
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:28,151
And l'm warning you not to have any more babies.

652
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:31,189
lt's hard enough as it is.

653
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:37,458
No!... lnstead of fewer raccoons, we need fewer humans!

654
01:00:38,244 --> 01:00:40,408
We used to have more territory.

655
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,592
Then along came those pigs!

656
01:00:43,049 --> 01:00:44,758
Drive the pigs out!

657
01:00:44,778 --> 01:00:46,487
Kill the pigs!

658
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,781
Drive them out!

659
01:00:48,801 --> 01:00:50,362
Kill them!

660
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:54,950
Just then...

661
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:46,667
l'll go to inform everyone.

662
01:01:58,247 --> 01:01:59,578
Tamasaburo!

663
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,540
l've brought back the Elders from Shikoku.

664
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:08,149
Well done, Tamasaburo!

665
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:21,736
Friends, on the way here, we have seen the devastated mountains.

666
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:25,498
You have our deepest sympathy.

667
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:30,042
We would like to hold a grand conference tonight.

668
01:02:30,723 --> 01:02:32,187
33rd year of Pom Poko.

669
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:33,671
Autumn.

670
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,712
On the arrival of the 3 Elders, the rally began.

671
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:43,550
There's a big moon out tonight.

672
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:49,156
Everyone, my name is Hage from Yachima.

673
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:54,300
This year l will be 999 years old.

674
01:02:55,772 --> 01:03:02,143
Why has Shikoku stayed undeveloped compared to here?

675
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:04,009
Because we have protected our mountains securely.

676
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:17,416
Our humans know what evil will befall them if they anger us.

677
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:25,791
We three are worshipped at every temple and shrine in Shikoku.

678
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:30,802
We are highly respected by humans.

679
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:40,742
l haven't introduced myself. l am Chief of all of Matsuyama.

680
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:46,487
My name is lnuganu Gyoubu.

681
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:50,387
l'm the Kincho Shrine's 6th generation chief, Kincho Vl.

682
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:57,093
We shall commence to eliminate the humans by using your transformation skills in a 'Spooking War'.

683
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:03,836
Commanding this battle will require the concentration of our highest combined spirit.

684
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:10,208
We 3 could even lose our lives as sacrifices to this battle.

685
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:20,384
However, if you complete this operation without error, you will win back the respect humans once had for you.

686
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:36,230
We must accept the danger and use all our might to stop the development.

687
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:39,734
We have a full arsenal of tricks.

688
01:04:40,186 --> 01:04:43,215
We have built a big solid boat.

689
01:04:43,235 --> 01:04:46,264
One that will carry us far.

690
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:52,846
Come confidently aboard our boat.

691
01:05:10,816 --> 01:05:14,027
What a beautiful moon.

692
01:05:14,047 --> 01:05:17,258
We like full moons.

693
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:24,211
This moon is praying for our success.

694
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:27,485
Don't you think so?

695
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:45,865
The raccoons began intense training for the spooking war.

696
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:05,895
Happy 999th birthday!

697
01:06:08,941 --> 01:06:11,088
Thank you, everyone.

698
01:06:11,108 --> 01:06:13,255
Thank you.

699
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:18,906
Master, will you tell the old story of Yoichi the archer?

700
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:22,210
Sure, why not.

701
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:10,214
The time is ripe.

702
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:25,662
33rd year of Pom Poko.

703
01:07:25,682 --> 01:07:27,261
Year's end.

704
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:29,968
lt was launching day of the Great Spooking War.

705
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:35,249
Slightly cloudy, no winds, 13 degrees centigrade, humidity 65% .

706
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:38,615
A perfect day for haunting.

707
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:19,725
lt has long been known that raccoons are highly skilled...

708
01:08:19,905 --> 01:08:23,099
at morphing into ghosts.

709
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:26,313
They're born with this ability.

710
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:29,834
Their task is to bring out this potential.

711
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:37,507
Just as nature's powers can be harnessed, accumulating and amplifying their energy is vital.

712
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:44,582
This was the objective of the special training by the three Masters.

713
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:49,085
Males, females, the skilled and unskilled alike.

714
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:53,054
They all participated by contributing their energy.

715
01:08:55,464 --> 01:09:06,708
That evening, with their united army, they would use their full strength, as no one had ever seen before.

716
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,682
What's that?

717
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:41,170
Let the dead trees all grow flowers!

718
01:12:02,795 --> 01:12:04,640
Wow!

719
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:06,505
A big parade of ghosts!

720
01:12:06,699 --> 01:12:10,098
l used to say those sorts of things.

721
01:12:10,118 --> 01:12:13,517
Like a parade of foxes...

722
01:12:13,806 --> 01:12:17,501
But you really saw them, right?

723
01:12:17,521 --> 01:12:21,216
With lanterns and all.

724
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:24,865
And the lanterns march along...

725
01:12:25,117 --> 01:12:27,611
-l wonder what ever happened?

726
01:12:27,631 --> 01:12:30,125
-Can foxes really do that?

727
01:12:34,093 --> 01:12:35,990
lt sure seems so.

728
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:37,907
But it makes me wonder...

729
01:12:38,163 --> 01:12:40,993
lt's probably just my nerves.

730
01:12:41,013 --> 01:12:43,843
All this talk about ghosts...

731
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:54,626
All those old stories about foxes and lanterns ...

732
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:59,939
lt's all in my head.

733
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:07,215
Make me think l saw them marching.

734
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:12,911
That's what nerves will do...

735
01:13:15,634 --> 01:13:18,299
Of course.

736
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:20,984
How foolish to even imagine...

737
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,085
Human nerves.

738
01:13:25,105 --> 01:13:28,350
They're a frightening thing.

739
01:13:29,248 --> 01:13:33,415
One would think there real.

740
01:13:33,435 --> 01:13:37,602
But they can't be real.

741
01:13:37,756 --> 01:13:40,335
-But they're real ghosts.

742
01:13:40,355 --> 01:13:42,934
-lt's all nerves, that's all.

743
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:48,248
Hi, honey.

744
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,249
Sachiko!

745
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:42,434
Abira Unken Sowaka!

746
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:54,981
Shikisoku Zeku!

747
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:10,128
Master Gyobu!

748
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:29,050
Aw, is it over already?

749
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:31,309
That was so cool!

750
01:16:31,563 --> 01:16:33,693
-Go inside and go to sleep now.

751
01:16:33,713 --> 01:16:35,843
-All right.

752
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:43,123
And be sure to brush your teeth.

753
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:48,593
l feel like l'm in a strange dream.

754
01:16:48,981 --> 01:16:50,394
Me too.

755
01:16:50,414 --> 01:16:51,827
What could that have been?

756
01:16:52,117 --> 01:16:55,345
-l think maybe it was a U.F.O.

757
01:16:55,365 --> 01:16:58,593
-Strange things do happen.

758
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:13,225
Long ago, when the Matsuyama Clan was at battle, Gyobu defected to the enemy, causing the downfall of his clan.

759
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:17,592
He regretted it so deeply, that he made a solemn vow.

760
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:23,369
He would devote his life to fighting for justice.

761
01:17:23,882 --> 01:17:24,356
Let his death not be wasted.

762
01:17:24,376 --> 01:17:24,850
Let us carry on his noble ideals.

763
01:17:30,922 --> 01:17:34,685
We will fight to the end.

764
01:17:34,705 --> 01:17:38,468
Until the Day of Triumph.

765
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:44,926
Raccoons, raccoons We drink sake, we transform.

766
01:17:45,203 --> 01:17:46,514
We will win the Spooking War!

767
01:17:46,534 --> 01:17:47,845
Victory!

768
01:17:47,865 --> 01:17:49,176
Victory!

769
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:54,392
ln the heat of their excitement, nobody was watching the TV.

770
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:59,636
We're looking for any video tape of this mysterious parade.

771
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:06,005
No one has come forward yet. lnvestigators are perplexed.

772
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:11,049
l shot all that videotape, but none of it came out.

773
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,014
This is really weird.

774
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:17,950
The ghost slipped in through here and it was terrifying!

775
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:21,956
A human could never do that.

776
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:30,204
Something's very fishy here. l want to move out if l can but...

777
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:34,067
At 12:20 tonight, we will bring you a special program...

778
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:38,076
with in-depth coverage of this mysterious event.

779
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:51,288
The investigation goes on and on.

780
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:59,458
But our witnesses recognize that it was real.

781
01:18:59,978 --> 01:19:03,576
They can't blame it on nerves.

782
01:19:03,596 --> 01:19:07,194
They can't explain it away.

783
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:15,247
The humans will be stupefied by the mystery of the universe.

784
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:19,046
And they'll realize the insignificance of their existence.

785
01:19:19,664 --> 01:19:21,976
Good fortune awaits us.

786
01:19:21,996 --> 01:19:24,308
But let's not wait for it.

787
01:19:24,603 --> 01:19:26,137
Let's wake it up.

788
01:19:26,157 --> 01:19:27,691
Let's celebrate!

789
01:19:27,711 --> 01:19:29,245
Drink up!

790
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:30,799
Sing!

791
01:19:30,819 --> 01:19:32,353
Dance!

792
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:43,672
But the next day, the situation took an unexpected turn.

793
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:55,590
Last night's impromptu parade in Tama New Town was actually a publicity stunt for the theme park, Wonderland, which is now under construction.

794
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:59,725
Police have interrogated all related parties.

795
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:01,221
lmpossible!

796
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:07,561
However, local residents claim it didn't look like a publicity event.

797
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:09,469
Of course not!

798
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:15,470
The president of Wonderland confessed to last night's stunt.

799
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,770
What did he say?

800
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:26,286
l would like to apologize to the public for this disturbance.

801
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:29,087
What is he trying to pull?

802
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:34,421
We are still working on the construction of Wonderland.

803
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:45,595
But to let everyone know what a splendid park we're building, we decided to give them all some free entertainment.

804
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:55,082
As president of the park, l chose to throw a surprise parade.

805
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,570
-Liar!

806
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:57,600
-What's he talking about!

807
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:04,223
Fortunately, we've received enormous public support.

808
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:09,295
We are overwhelmed.

809
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:23,602
lf they must lock me up for this, l'm prepared to pay the price.

810
01:21:24,189 --> 01:21:26,137
-What the...

811
01:21:26,157 --> 01:21:28,105
-Why...

812
01:21:28,683 --> 01:21:30,742
Something is very wrong here!

813
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:35,417
lf they must lock me up for this, l'm prepared to pay the price.

814
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:36,887
That fool!

815
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:42,330
The news threw the raccoons into a state of panic.

816
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:47,727
At Wonderland, they searched for the parade's organizers.

817
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:50,431
l can't do all the work around here!

818
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:54,803
Find whoever was responsible! l want no stone left unturned!

819
01:21:55,186 --> 01:21:57,367
We'll lure them in with money!

820
01:21:57,387 --> 01:21:59,568
As much as it takes!

821
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:01,409
lt was done by raccoons.

822
01:22:01,593 --> 01:22:02,862
What?

823
01:22:02,882 --> 01:22:04,151
Raccoons?

824
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:05,440
Then get me a raccoon!

825
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:07,456
Any raccoon!

826
01:22:07,476 --> 01:22:09,202
Contact the raccoon's manager!

827
01:22:10,435 --> 01:22:12,182
-Raccoon?

828
01:22:12,202 --> 01:22:13,949
What did you say?

829
01:22:13,969 --> 01:22:15,716
-l was only joking.

830
01:22:16,541 --> 01:22:18,535
This is no time for jokes.

831
01:22:18,555 --> 01:22:20,549
How did you get in here?

832
01:22:20,779 --> 01:22:23,507
Your secretary. l phoned earlier.

833
01:22:23,527 --> 01:22:26,255
My name's Ryutaro.

834
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:31,870
You seem to be in a tight spot.

835
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:37,215
But l happen to be the only man who can talk to the raccoons for you.

836
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:40,854
l see. l'll give you $ 1 million.

837
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:51,792
While this strange looking man pursued his scheme, the raccoons were enraged that that their glory had been stolen.

838
01:22:52,243 --> 01:22:55,892
They cried with resentment.

839
01:22:55,912 --> 01:22:59,561
And sunk into helplessness.

840
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:10,674
Since there was no video tape of the ghost parade, TV coverage tapered off.

841
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:25,260
You're a fox, aren't you?

842
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:36,540
Precisely. l'm Ryutaro, transforming fox of Tama.

843
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:43,540
l've long heard tales of the Great Kincho from Awa.

844
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:47,283
l'm honored to be in your presence.

845
01:23:47,532 --> 01:23:49,241
l'm just the sixth Kincho.

846
01:23:49,261 --> 01:23:50,970
So tell me, why are you here?

847
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:53,920
l was deeply moved by your fabulous parade.

848
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:56,523
So you know it was us.

849
01:23:56,808 --> 01:23:59,257
lndeed.

850
01:23:59,277 --> 01:24:01,726
And l understand your despair and discouragement.

851
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:05,272
You really understand?

852
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:14,307
l predicted everything that happened after the parade.

853
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:15,710
What did you say?

854
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:24,448
Ryutaro the fox invited Kincho to join him on the Ginza in a special room at a certain well known club.

855
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:27,523
Please, be my guest!

856
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:31,727
Don't worry, all these ladies are really foxes.

857
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,971
Would you prefer them like this or as foxes?

858
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:42,337
...or shall we have them change to raccoons?

859
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,774
Let's be frank.

860
01:24:46,558 --> 01:24:48,989
Raccoons have no future in Tama.

861
01:24:49,009 --> 01:24:51,440
Foxes there have already died.

862
01:24:52,097 --> 01:24:53,760
They've perished already?

863
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:55,443
The foxes?

864
01:24:55,767 --> 01:24:57,545
Yes. lt's a pity.

865
01:24:57,565 --> 01:24:59,343
And only a few transforming ones...

866
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:03,327
are surviving by living as humans.

867
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:05,488
As humans?

868
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,827
lt's the only way to survive in a big city like Tokyo.

869
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:14,542
l brought you here to persuade you raccoons to do the same.

870
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:16,073
Just a moment!

871
01:25:16,521 --> 01:25:18,822
l understand your shock.

872
01:25:18,842 --> 01:25:21,143
But in these pressing times, we must take drastic measures.

873
01:25:21,163 --> 01:25:23,464
There's even more to it than that.

874
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:26,552
lf you swallow poison, why not drink the whole bottle?

875
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:31,589
The best solution is for you all to get jobs at Wonderland.

876
01:25:32,403 --> 01:25:34,584
What?

877
01:25:34,604 --> 01:25:36,785
Work for our enemy?

878
01:25:37,108 --> 01:25:39,722
Let's think calmly.

879
01:25:39,742 --> 01:25:42,356
At this point the raccoons have no choice.

880
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:44,638
That much is given.

881
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:50,036
lt takes money to live as humans And how can you earn a living?

882
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:52,912
You must use your specialty.

883
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:57,114
How about getting a job where they pay the most money?

884
01:25:57,919 --> 01:26:01,377
lt's too bad your enemy is Wonderland.

885
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:04,750
They also pay considerable benefits.

886
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:08,085
This is the monthly salary.

887
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:09,919
And these are the benefits.

888
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:15,625
Of course, no one other than me will know that you're raccoons.

889
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:20,702
Bon appetite.

890
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:25,386
Think about it over dinner.

891
01:26:25,406 --> 01:26:28,572
Please enjoy the food, Kincho lV.

892
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:32,545
You must be tired of eating scraps from the Tama garbage.

893
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,185
l don't mind so much.

894
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:36,180
l have one question.

895
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:43,493
lf we must live as humans, what about those who can't transform?

896
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:45,860
l can't solve everything.

897
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:50,195
At least the strongest ones will survive.

898
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:55,206
We foxes too had to abandon our weaker members.

899
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:58,205
Then... they were left to die?

900
01:26:58,523 --> 01:27:00,033
Yes.

901
01:27:00,053 --> 01:27:01,563
A heart-wrenching choice.

902
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:06,983
How tragic.

903
01:27:08,066 --> 01:27:12,013
lt might ease your mind to note that unlike foxes, raccoons can eat anything.

904
01:27:12,033 --> 01:27:15,980
They might make it somehow.

905
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:24,801
ln Kincho Vl's absence, the Tama Raccoons were discussing a counter measure.

906
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,131
Only the core group attended.

907
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:31,803
We have all the arms we need.

908
01:27:31,823 --> 01:27:35,006
We must attack now.

909
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:42,222
lt was a mistake to wait this long in the first place.

910
01:27:42,834 --> 01:27:47,330
l say, 'Don't sell the pelt until you've skinned the fox.' Not even Buddha could help us.

911
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:51,846
We must not blame the elders.

912
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:57,561
Why do the humans all say, 'tricky like a raccoon'?

913
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:01,031
You talk about humans too much, Shokichi!

914
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:04,907
l'm just trying to learn more about humans...

915
01:28:05,089 --> 01:28:07,065
Shut up!

916
01:28:07,085 --> 01:28:09,061
We must kill all the humans!

917
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,979
Control yourself, Gonta.

918
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:21,059
l think we should tell the humans that we started the Spooking War.

919
01:28:21,339 --> 01:28:24,454
Have you lost your mind ?

920
01:28:24,474 --> 01:28:27,589
That's just what we mustn't do.

921
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:34,066
True. lf they knew it was us, they'd be on our tails.

922
01:28:34,552 --> 01:28:37,763
l'm appalled.

923
01:28:37,783 --> 01:28:40,994
Why must it be kept secret?

924
01:28:41,716 --> 01:28:44,150
l can't accept this.

925
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:55,790
l want to shout it out! 'We are the ones who did it!' How would we get them to believe us?

926
01:28:56,207 --> 01:28:59,685
A public declaration.

927
01:28:59,705 --> 01:29:03,183
Call the TV stations, or send letters.

928
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:07,937
They'll probably think it's a practical joke.

929
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:12,608
Then we'll go on TV and show them our transformations.

930
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:17,183
They'll say it's a trick and we'll be humiliated.

931
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:20,914
Look, it's a waste of time arguing.

932
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:22,783
This much was true.

933
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:26,218
The debate went back and forth, and on into the night.

934
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:31,354
This argument is a waste of time.

935
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:35,860
But if we provoke those terrorists, they will kill us all.

936
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:38,231
That's why we shouldn't reveal our secret!

937
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:41,273
lf we reveal ourselves, we're throwing away our only weapon.

938
01:29:41,676 --> 01:29:44,702
ln this case we don't have much choice.

939
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:51,815
There's only one thing left we can do.

940
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:57,787
lnstead of splitting up, we must combine our strength.

941
01:29:59,627 --> 01:30:03,996
We must launch Spooking War ll.

942
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:08,225
lt might end up the same way.

943
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:12,364
We'll perfect a new plan and a fresh attitude.

944
01:30:12,774 --> 01:30:16,369
You just don't have the guts to fight, you stinking girl.

945
01:30:16,788 --> 01:30:18,566
Watch what you say!

946
01:30:18,586 --> 01:30:20,364
Girls don't stink.

947
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:23,842
lf they did, he'd be one.

948
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:28,078
l intend to start preparations for Spooking War ll.

949
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,655
And who will follow you?

950
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:33,252
Will anyone follow you ?

951
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:36,162
What do mean by that?

952
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:39,790
Cut it out!

953
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,701
Everyone listen up!

954
01:30:45,072 --> 01:30:49,668
There's only one way to live in unity.

955
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:54,679
And it requires the use of your special talents.

956
01:30:55,917 --> 01:31:00,251
Your ability overwhelmed the humans in the Spooking War.

957
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:05,421
This may sound crazy, but a non-human can be 'human'.

958
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:09,693
Given this, what should we do?

959
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:16,328
How do you make an egg stand straight up?

960
01:31:17,872 --> 01:31:21,069
As you know, Columbus did it like this.

961
01:31:24,322 --> 01:31:25,436
-Wow!

962
01:31:25,456 --> 01:31:26,570
That's great!

963
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:27,704
-Bravo!

964
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:30,213
ls your plan as great as that?

965
01:31:31,886 --> 01:31:36,448
From now on we will live as non-human 'humans'.

966
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:39,291
You gotta be joking.

967
01:31:40,061 --> 01:31:42,962
No, this is no joke.

968
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:45,831
But what about the ones who can't transform?

969
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:47,762
Where's the Reverend?

970
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:59,108
Appeal from all raccoons While the Reverend was gone, they refused to agree to Kincho Vl's plan.

971
01:31:59,257 --> 01:32:01,319
The meeting ended with chaos.

972
01:32:01,339 --> 01:32:03,401
Their unity was destroyed.

973
01:32:05,753 --> 01:32:08,017
They had almost no food left.

974
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:14,818
Hard-driving Gonta went around recruiting troops for his battle.

975
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:19,263
Master Hage gathered the non-transforming raccoons...

976
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:23,301
and gave them faith with a new religious dance.

977
01:32:24,415 --> 01:32:27,262
These are chaotic times.

978
01:32:27,282 --> 01:32:30,129
Our boat has turned to mud.

979
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:34,344
Save us, merciful Buddha.

980
01:32:36,127 --> 01:32:38,103
l hope to grow old like Hage.

981
01:32:38,123 --> 01:32:40,099
So vigorous with old age.

982
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:42,813
Tokyo is such a frightening place.

983
01:32:43,157 --> 01:32:46,285
ln Shikoku, that prayer would have instant effects.

984
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:53,366
Offerings at our shrine would double ...no, quadruple!

985
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:59,270
Kincho Vl, l can't wait any longer.

986
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:01,597
l want to go back to Shikoku with you!

987
01:33:01,617 --> 01:33:03,764
To the Kincho Shrine.

988
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:07,378
Really, Tamasaburo?

989
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:11,852
You've decided to be my successor?

990
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:13,782
Yes, Kincho Vl.

991
01:33:14,465 --> 01:33:17,278
l'm relieved to hear that.

992
01:33:17,298 --> 01:33:20,111
But you do this ...

993
01:33:20,294 --> 01:33:27,063
not to abandon your comrades, but because you love my daughter?

994
01:33:27,278 --> 01:33:28,726
Yes, of course.

995
01:33:28,746 --> 01:33:30,194
But...

996
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:32,099
But what?

997
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:39,345
No one is following your orders now. lsn't there anything we can do?

998
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:42,312
Yes, there is something we can do.

999
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:52,491
This is quite a fancy restaurant.

1000
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:56,927
We spared no expense to please you.

1001
01:34:03,914 --> 01:34:06,875
Good job.

1002
01:34:06,895 --> 01:34:09,856
We'll even beat Disneyland.

1003
01:34:31,232 --> 01:34:39,562
To get revenge on the president, Kincho Vl led the raccoons in apprehending all his money.

1004
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:46,879
The president ran to the police to report the theft of $ l million by raccoons...

1005
01:34:47,048 --> 01:34:49,209
But they didn't believe him.

1006
01:34:52,253 --> 01:34:59,689
That same day, Gonta's army began their operations to stop the deforestation of the next mountain.

1007
01:35:17,011 --> 01:35:19,104
All of you preservationists.

1008
01:35:19,513 --> 01:35:24,280
Leave these woods at once.

1009
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:32,715
You are charged with robbery, possession of dangerous weapons and illegal trespassing.

1010
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:41,229
lf you fail to evacuate immediately, we will use force to remove you.

1011
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:59,015
Gonta's troops had the police and workers fixed to the road.

1012
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:01,950
They would not budge an inch.

1013
01:36:03,157 --> 01:36:07,423
By nightfall, both sides still held their positions.

1014
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:19,702
lf we can't stop Gonta, we have no choice but to help him.

1015
01:36:21,719 --> 01:36:24,652
The riot police are already there.

1016
01:36:24,672 --> 01:36:27,605
You're too late.

1017
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,188
l'll just go check it out.

1018
01:36:35,466 --> 01:36:36,534
-Stop!

1019
01:36:36,554 --> 01:36:37,622
You'll be caught too!

1020
01:36:37,642 --> 01:36:38,710
-We're going too!

1021
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,063
Everyone ready?

1022
01:36:53,174 --> 01:37:08,415
With our spirit of honor, if we are sacrificed in battle, our brother raccoons will continue to fight with undying determination until our day of victory.

1023
01:37:09,233 --> 01:37:15,418
We raccoons, with balls of steel swinging in the wind.

1024
01:37:15,438 --> 01:37:21,623
Amen.

1025
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:24,660
Special mission!

1026
01:37:25,115 --> 01:37:26,176
-Wait, Gonta!

1027
01:37:26,196 --> 01:37:27,257
-Don't do anything hasty!

1028
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:28,339
Let's go!

1029
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:46,348
Gonta!

1030
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:32,161
They used their tails as weapons in a brave kamikaze attack.

1031
01:38:35,319 --> 01:38:36,152
Mr.

1032
01:38:36,172 --> 01:38:37,005
Raccoon, Mr.

1033
01:38:37,025 --> 01:38:37,858
Raccoon.

1034
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:43,515
Just then, in another part of the forest, a TV reporter was sent to get an interview with a raccoon.

1035
01:38:43,717 --> 01:38:46,345
Won't you please come out?

1036
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:48,209
You can transform if you like.

1037
01:38:48,229 --> 01:38:49,808
Or stay as you are.

1038
01:38:50,224 --> 01:38:56,720
We at ''World Telereporter'' are your fans!

1039
01:39:00,501 --> 01:39:03,197
They're not coming out yet.

1040
01:39:03,981 --> 01:39:06,742
Mr.

1041
01:39:06,762 --> 01:39:09,523
Raccoon, can we talk?

1042
01:39:10,377 --> 01:39:13,369
We have nothing to eat.

1043
01:39:13,857 --> 01:39:15,617
They're responding!

1044
01:39:15,637 --> 01:39:17,397
The appeal is true!

1045
01:39:17,728 --> 01:39:20,939
We would like to know your reasons.

1046
01:39:20,959 --> 01:39:24,170
Will you come out?

1047
01:39:24,535 --> 01:39:26,148
There they are!

1048
01:39:26,168 --> 01:39:27,781
The raccoons!

1049
01:39:28,495 --> 01:39:31,623
Did you really put on the ghost parade?

1050
01:39:32,199 --> 01:39:33,826
Yes, we did.

1051
01:39:35,836 --> 01:39:40,671
Won't you show us your fine transforming talent?

1052
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:44,537
So that our viewers will believe you.

1053
01:39:44,778 --> 01:39:48,441
There are some raccoons who can't transform.

1054
01:39:48,682 --> 01:39:53,176
This is why we need our forest to live.

1055
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:06,323
Listen, raccoons, you're making my show look bad.

1056
01:40:06,577 --> 01:40:10,926
You all have something to say.

1057
01:40:10,946 --> 01:40:15,295
So please have some good faith.

1058
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:18,201
Reverend!

1059
01:40:18,822 --> 01:40:20,816
Please!

1060
01:40:20,836 --> 01:40:22,830
Tell the humans our demands.

1061
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:32,781
He came out!

1062
01:40:32,801 --> 01:40:35,682
A real raccoon statue is walking this way!

1063
01:40:44,882 --> 01:40:46,944
Mr.

1064
01:40:46,964 --> 01:40:49,026
Raccoon, please let us hear your comments.

1065
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,117
We...

1066
01:40:51,137 --> 01:40:52,534
We...

1067
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:57,311
Yes, Please go on.

1068
01:41:06,994 --> 01:41:09,656
We are the ones who did it!

1069
01:41:10,074 --> 01:41:12,956
This forest is our home!

1070
01:41:12,976 --> 01:41:15,858
We won't have you taking it away from us This is the wish of all living things!

1071
01:42:00,914 --> 01:42:04,611
The people l saw yesterday Are gone today.

1072
01:42:05,419 --> 01:42:08,547
The people l saw today Will be gone tomorrow.

1073
01:42:09,423 --> 01:42:12,790
Nobody knows about the day after that.

1074
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:16,861
But the day will come when the people will be sorry.

1075
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:26,701
The Battle of Yashima, in the year 1000 AD, Was seen by the eyes of the 999 year old Hage, respected Master of raccoons.

1076
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:31,740
Having seen enough of the world, He decided to bid farewell.

1077
01:42:31,945 --> 01:42:36,382
He took his massive balls, and stretched them out wide.

1078
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:40,543
To make a treasure boat.

1079
01:42:43,457 --> 01:42:47,621
He filled it with treasures: Lacquer, gold, jewels.

1080
01:42:47,961 --> 01:42:52,455
Buddha would carry them from earth to heaven.

1081
01:42:53,400 --> 01:43:02,909
Cheerfully singing at the top of their lungs, the raccoons embarked merrily on their journey to heaven.

1082
01:43:05,856 --> 01:43:10,753
The treasure boat sailed along the Tama River, Floating with the waves.

1083
01:43:10,773 --> 01:43:15,670
Rocking and swaying.

1084
01:43:15,866 --> 01:43:19,361
The sail filled with wind.

1085
01:43:19,381 --> 01:43:22,876
They waited for the tide.

1086
01:43:23,664 --> 01:43:26,599
Waiting for the moon, the water rippled.

1087
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,395
The treasure boat sailed, rocking under the moon.

1088
01:43:32,015 --> 01:43:34,196
lt was a dreamlike night.

1089
01:43:34,216 --> 01:43:36,397
With bells, flutes and drums.

1090
01:43:36,677 --> 01:43:45,049
Loaded full of raccoons, full of gold, silver and coral, the treasure boat drifted away.

1091
01:43:45,485 --> 01:43:52,220
But before the boat turned to mud, The other raccoons watched...

1092
01:43:52,693 --> 01:43:56,424
as it entered the mist like a dream on a night in spring.

1093
01:43:56,697 --> 01:44:03,865
As they looked up at the moon, Buddha beckoned them to heaven.

1094
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:08,140
And they crossed over to the other world.

1095
01:44:08,685 --> 01:44:10,895
All the raccoons died.

1096
01:44:10,915 --> 01:44:13,125
On the journey of death.

1097
01:44:14,024 --> 01:44:16,251
A journey with no return.

1098
01:44:16,271 --> 01:44:18,498
A journey of death.

1099
01:44:18,862 --> 01:44:21,311
Poor raccoons.

1100
01:44:21,331 --> 01:44:23,780
On the journey of death.

1101
01:44:28,028 --> 01:44:32,124
We're no match for the humans.

1102
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:55,984
Bunta! ls that Bunta?

1103
01:44:59,192 --> 01:45:00,591
Tamasaburo!

1104
01:45:04,541 --> 01:45:05,742
-lt's good to see you back!

1105
01:45:05,762 --> 01:45:06,963
-Sasuke!

1106
01:45:06,983 --> 01:45:08,184
Shokichi!

1107
01:45:09,046 --> 01:45:11,341
What happened to the elder from Sado?

1108
01:45:11,361 --> 01:45:13,656
Master Danzaburo?

1109
01:45:14,107 --> 01:45:23,772
Well, after searching all this time, l found out that 45 years ago, he died in the famine after the war.

1110
01:45:24,351 --> 01:45:29,084
l see. l was hoping to meet him...

1111
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:32,291
Thank you for your efforts, Bunta.

1112
01:45:37,698 --> 01:45:42,658
Tell me what has happened here. l've been away for three years.

1113
01:45:43,036 --> 01:45:46,233
We've done all sorts of things.

1114
01:45:46,683 --> 01:45:48,244
But everything has changed!

1115
01:45:48,264 --> 01:45:49,825
Or am l crazy?

1116
01:45:50,253 --> 01:45:52,247
-l understand your reaction.

1117
01:45:52,267 --> 01:45:54,261
-ls this the work of the humans?

1118
01:45:54,715 --> 01:45:57,548
Yes, this is what the humans did.

1119
01:45:57,961 --> 01:45:59,629
lmpossible!

1120
01:45:59,649 --> 01:46:01,317
Only raccoons could be this tricky.

1121
01:46:01,337 --> 01:46:03,005
Not humans!

1122
01:46:04,234 --> 01:46:07,479
The humans have taken over!

1123
01:46:07,499 --> 01:46:10,744
They treat us like stinking beggars!

1124
01:46:12,976 --> 01:46:14,873
Give us back our mountains!

1125
01:46:14,893 --> 01:46:16,790
Give us back our fields!

1126
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:18,801
Give us back our home!

1127
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:35,847
Shall we give it another try?

1128
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:40,793
One last effort to change this place back to the way it was?

1129
01:46:41,238 --> 01:46:44,267
Why not...

1130
01:46:44,287 --> 01:46:47,316
We could challenge the humans with illusions.

1131
01:46:48,268 --> 01:46:52,295
Sounds interesting. l can see the scenery already.

1132
01:46:52,682 --> 01:46:53,811
Perfect.

1133
01:46:53,831 --> 01:46:54,960
Our last victory!

1134
01:46:55,986 --> 01:46:58,617
But, what would it prove?

1135
01:46:58,637 --> 01:47:01,268
To do something like that now?

1136
01:47:01,848 --> 01:47:04,874
For our amusement... our amusement.

1137
01:47:06,787 --> 01:47:10,848
A raccoon's not a raccoon without a playful spirit.

1138
01:47:11,391 --> 01:47:14,121
Will you help us too, Master?

1139
01:47:14,728 --> 01:47:19,392
Of course. lf you don't mind a little southern flair.

1140
01:47:19,933 --> 01:47:20,865
Ponkichi!

1141
01:47:21,244 --> 01:47:22,606
l'm here!

1142
01:47:22,626 --> 01:47:23,988
Let's go tell everyone who's left.

1143
01:47:24,247 --> 01:47:25,791
-Lend me your energy again?

1144
01:47:25,811 --> 01:47:27,355
-You can count on me!

1145
01:49:22,355 --> 01:49:25,051
Wait for me, big brother!

1146
01:49:38,838 --> 01:49:41,932
Oh, that looks like Mother.

1147
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:44,550
lt's Yotchan!

1148
01:49:44,570 --> 01:49:45,500
Yotchan!

1149
01:50:14,474 --> 01:50:19,036
That's us there! lt's us when we were little!

1150
01:50:25,996 --> 01:50:27,053
-Hey!

1151
01:50:27,073 --> 01:50:28,130
Raccoons!

1152
01:50:28,150 --> 01:50:29,207
-Oh, cute!

1153
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:34,291
Look Mom, raccoons!

1154
01:50:34,471 --> 01:50:36,351
There back again!

1155
01:50:36,371 --> 01:50:38,251
Even in a place like this.

1156
01:50:42,135 --> 01:50:44,433
Wait, raccoons!

1157
01:50:48,942 --> 01:50:51,035
Shucks, they left.

1158
01:50:51,244 --> 01:50:57,012
-l wanted to give them some food -Can raccoons really transform?

1159
01:51:01,688 --> 01:51:03,918
That's how we lost our battle.

1160
01:51:04,267 --> 01:51:06,329
And the New Town development continued.

1161
01:51:06,349 --> 01:51:08,411
With no obstacles.

1162
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:15,059
As the days went by, the new scene grew familiar.

1163
01:51:15,368 --> 01:51:18,337
For humans, it was a nice place to live.

1164
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:24,634
Trendy new condominiums were built where the temple once was.

1165
01:51:25,478 --> 01:51:28,572
lt turned out to be a good decision...

1166
01:51:28,948 --> 01:51:33,078
that we revealed ourselves to the humans that time.

1167
01:51:34,154 --> 01:51:36,315
The result was a community...

1168
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:40,892
that made efforts to live in harmony with the raccoons.

1169
01:51:41,071 --> 01:51:44,066
They also left the rest of our trees alone.

1170
01:51:44,086 --> 01:51:47,081
And made several parks.

1171
01:51:48,978 --> 01:51:51,524
But for us, it was too late.

1172
01:51:51,544 --> 01:51:54,090
There wasn't room for us to live.

1173
01:51:54,974 --> 01:52:00,935
Some of us went over the mountain to live in a town called Machida.

1174
01:52:01,681 --> 01:52:04,650
But there were raccoons there too...

1175
01:52:04,984 --> 01:52:08,044
who suffered because of suburban development.

1176
01:52:08,231 --> 01:52:10,128
Many were killed on the road.

1177
01:52:10,148 --> 01:52:12,045
The days got harder and harder.

1178
01:52:13,093 --> 01:52:17,962
Then, we made the fateful decision.

1179
01:52:30,987 --> 01:52:34,118
That's right.

1180
01:52:34,138 --> 01:52:37,269
Those of us who can transform are living as humans.

1181
01:52:37,484 --> 01:52:39,247
Just like the foxes.

1182
01:52:39,529 --> 01:52:41,374
l have a desk job.

1183
01:52:41,394 --> 01:52:43,239
And my wife, Kiyo, works at a bar.

1184
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:48,484
Some are working in real estate, others in forestry.

1185
01:52:48,695 --> 01:52:54,998
But l'm so exhausted with stress. l want to go back to my forest.

1186
01:52:56,736 --> 01:53:01,435
How can humans endure living like this?

1187
01:53:01,708 --> 01:53:06,475
There are some who drop out and live in the city streets.

1188
01:53:06,646 --> 01:53:11,606
eating discarded food in the alleys.

1189
01:53:17,557 --> 01:53:21,493
How about Ponkichi and the other ordinary raccoons?

1190
01:53:47,787 --> 01:53:52,190
'Carefree living' is an expression made for raccoons.

1191
01:53:53,092 --> 01:54:02,294
They overcome all obstacles, live happily and freely, Make babies with a carefree spirit, and die.

1192
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:45,669
There's always someone...

1193
01:54:45,689 --> 01:54:48,639
By my side...

1194
01:54:52,185 --> 01:54:53,709
Ponkichi!

1195
01:54:56,623 --> 01:54:58,386
Shokichi!

1196
01:55:01,271 --> 01:55:03,168
-Welcome back!

1197
01:55:03,188 --> 01:55:05,085
-You haven't changed a bit!

1198
01:55:05,441 --> 01:55:08,356
There's always sure to be...

1199
01:55:08,376 --> 01:55:11,291
Someone by my side.

1200
01:55:12,749 --> 01:55:17,210
Even if you go far away...

1201
01:55:17,230 --> 01:55:21,691
From the place you were born, You'll never be forgotten...

1202
01:55:21,711 --> 01:55:26,172
When you return.

1203
01:55:26,653 --> 01:55:35,151
On the TV, they said that foxes or raccoons, were 'erasing the scenery at the development sites.' Will you stop saying that?

1204
01:55:35,428 --> 01:55:40,456
lt's true that some raccoons and foxes probably do those things.

1205
01:55:40,733 --> 01:55:44,567
But how about the rabbits and weasels?

1206
01:55:44,904 --> 01:55:47,805
Can you erase it yourself?

1207
01:56:10,296 --> 01:56:37,245
