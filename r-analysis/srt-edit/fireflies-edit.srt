00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:14,820
A Team Nanban (594mgnav) Release September 21, 1945.

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:25,056
That was the night I died.

3
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,015
So disgusting!

4
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,725
Watch it!

5
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,978
He's filthy.

6
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,437
Is he dead?

7
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,731
Such a disgraceful sight.

8
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,776
Don't want Americans to see this!

9
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,620
Mama!

10
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,709
What day is it today?

11
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,305
Setsuko...

12
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,108
Another one...

13
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,665
What's this?

14
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:06,324
Don't bother.

15
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:07,867
Just toss it.

16
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,475
This one is going too.

17
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,353
Those blank eyes tell you it's over.

19
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:55,951
To the shelters!

20
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,174
Hear it's a large formation.

21
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,844
The shelter behind the firehouse should be safe.

22
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,514
Maybe they'll bomb elsewhere this time?

23
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,350
Makes me hot.

24
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,394
Now be a good girl and put this on.

25
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,777
I'll have a head start now.

26
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,905
You two, be sure to hurry along.

27
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,700
Setsuko, listen to your big brother.

28
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,620
Mama, you should hurry and go!

29
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,121
Yes, dear.

30
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,375
Mama, you got your medicine?

31
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,710
Yes, I got it.

32
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,133
I don't like shelters.

33
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,886
You want to get blown to bits?

34
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,555
Climb on!

35
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,855
My doll!

36
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,410
To the shelters!

37
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,744
Seita.

38
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,926
Heads down!

39
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,024
No!

40
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,300
Seita!

41
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,120
Seita!

42
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,940
Seita!

43
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,880
Seita!

44
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:45,973
Hurry!

45
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,390
Did you get everything?

46
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:49,059
Don't forget that!

47
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:50,226
Quick!

48
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,793
Long live the Emperor!

49
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,471
Don't worry.

50
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:08,972
We're safe here.

51
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,569
Where did Mama go?

52
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,947
She's in the shelter.

53
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,900
It could stand even a 250-kg bomb.

54
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,611
She'll be fine.

55
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,343
Mama will come to the twin pines.

56
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,179
We agreed to meet there.

57
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,515
Let's rest a little.

58
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,898
Everything all right, Setsuko?

59
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,901
I lost a clog.

60
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,197
I'll buy you a much better one.

61
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,493
I have money too.

62
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,001
Open this.

63
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,222
You're rich!

64
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,109
So this is black rain.

65
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,067
It's all gone...

66
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,446
Look, that's the public hall.

67
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,574
Remember we had porridge there?

68
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,454
Did our house burn down?

69
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,122
Seems like it.

70
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,124
What are we going to do?

71
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,628
Dad will make them pay.

72
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,010
Mama!

73
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,470
Mama!

74
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,158
I'd feel guilty if only our house was left.

75
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,911
Glad it's all gone.

76
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:09,570
Mr.

77
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,113
Miura got a direct hit.

78
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:12,656
I feel so sorry for him.

79
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,627
I'm glad you were safe.

80
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,633
We got two direct hits.

81
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,136
The oil would spill if we tried to move them.

82
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,140
No, it's not her!

83
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,687
Seita, I have to pee.

84
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,230
Okay.

85
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:50,245
Attention, residents of Kaminaka, Kaminishi, and Ichirizuka!

86
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:53,281
Please go to the elementary school!

87
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:56,117
We've set up a first aid station!

88
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,210
What's wrong?

89
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,712
My eyes hurt.

90
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,213
Don't rub them.

91
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,925
Let's go get them washed.

92
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,762
Where's Mama?

93
00:14:06,898 --> 00:14:07,816
- She'll be at school.

94
00:14:07,836 --> 00:14:08,754
- School?

95
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,985
- Yes, let's hurry.

96
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:11,090
- Okay.

97
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:17,158
Don't cry.

98
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:18,763
Be good now.

99
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,409
Seita!

100
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,206
Have you seen your mother?

101
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:35,864
She's injured.

102
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:37,114
You must go at once.

103
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,419
I'll stay with her.

104
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:41,495
That was scary.

105
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:42,829
You didn't cry?

106
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,427
Let's wait for your brother here.

107
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:57,386
Seita, I've been looking for you.

108
00:14:57,406 --> 00:14:59,179
How are you?

109
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:00,389
- Where's Mama?

110
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:01,431
- Come with me.

111
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,535
This is your Mama's.

112
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,748
In here.

113
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,595
She's finally asleep now.

114
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,738
She should be moved to a hospital.

115
00:15:36,758 --> 00:15:39,136
We're asking about it.

116
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:44,276
I hear Kaisei Hospital wasn't hit.

117
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:46,825
Sir.

118
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,507
Mama has a bad heart.

119
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:50,189
Can she get medicine for that?

120
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,492
Okay, we'll ask.

121
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,581
I'll come again.

122
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,629
Mama?

123
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:27,205
- You saw her?

124
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:28,185
- Yes...

125
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,280
I'm so sorry.

126
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,657
I'm thirsty.

127
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,081
Is there anything I can do?

128
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:43,930
I know.

129
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,035
Did you get biscuits?

130
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,214
I'll get you some.

131
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:00,384
Keep this ring in your purse.

132
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:02,386
Don't lose it, okay?

133
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:07,400
Mama's a little sick, but she'll be better soon.

134
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,945
Where is she?

135
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,280
In a hospital in Nishinomiya.

136
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,912
So tonight, we'll stay at school.

137
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,738
Then tomorrow...

138
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:23,906
Remember our aunt in Nishinomiya?

139
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,585
We're going there.

140
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,296
Okay?

141
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:40,841
We're staying upstairs.

142
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:42,676
Won't you join us?

143
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,109
Thank you, we'll go later.

144
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,070
See you later then.

145
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,116
Want to eat?

146
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,035
I want to go see Mama.

147
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:01,695
Maybe tomorrow.

148
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:02,904
It's late now.

149
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,011
Hey, look at this!

150
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:24,632
Can't unwrap her.

151
00:19:24,652 --> 00:19:26,237
Better not look.

152
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:28,282
Especially in this heat...

153
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:30,200
Got to get rid of this today.

154
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,396
Where's your little sister?

155
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,691
I took her to Nishinomiya this morning.

156
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,443
Distant relatives are taking us in.

157
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,113
Glad to hear that.

158
00:19:58,374 --> 00:20:00,418
Well, I must get back to my duties.

159
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:02,482
You take care.

160
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,790
Mama!

161
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,417
Where's Mama?

162
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,545
Is Mama still not feeling good?

163
00:21:37,723 --> 00:21:38,683
That's right.

164
00:21:38,703 --> 00:21:39,663
She got hurt in the air raid.

165
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,466
You're back.

166
00:21:43,854 --> 00:21:45,272
How was it?

167
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:46,710
Was she in Kaisei Hospital?

168
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,807
Err, yes...

169
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:52,175
Navy folks are so privileged.

170
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:54,677
Using a truck even to evacuate!

171
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,317
Mosquito net and beddings are in your room.

172
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,860
Thank you.

173
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,497
Doesn't Mama need this ring anymore?

174
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,751
Do I get to keep it?

175
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,050
You should put that away.

176
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,767
About Mama...

177
00:22:34,738 --> 00:22:37,116
- We'll visit Mama when she's better.

178
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:39,514
- Okay.

179
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:41,391
- Go to bed now.

180
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:42,558
- Okay.

181
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,937
Herrings, dried bonito, dried potatoes, and eggs.

182
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,314
There're pickled plums.

183
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,693
Why, this is butter!

184
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,365
You'd never know things are scarce in wartime.

185
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,368
You military folks are spoiled.

186
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,080
So, did you stop by the hospital?

187
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,166
Your mother and I must talk about the future.

188
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:06,337
I could take Setsuko along and visit her.

189
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,882
She didn't make it?!

190
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,511
Mama died at school two days ago.

191
00:25:13,689 --> 00:25:14,836
What?!

192
00:25:14,856 --> 00:25:16,003
Your Mama died...!

193
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,519
Why didn't you tell me right away?

194
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,230
You should know better.

195
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,858
Didn't want Setsuko to know.

196
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,403
Your Mama's dead...

197
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,739
This is bad.

198
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,576
Must inform your father at once!

199
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:43,916
Seita!

200
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,503
She bought me new clogs.

201
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,340
Good for you.

202
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,092
Welcome home.

203
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,072
Tough times for you kids.

204
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,740
Thank you for the bath.

205
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,454
What's that sound?

206
00:26:21,965 --> 00:26:23,634
Don't be scared.

207
00:26:23,654 --> 00:26:25,323
They're bullfrogs.

208
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,793
A firefly!

209
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,302
Here, catch.

210
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,299
Oh no!

211
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,299
You squished it!

212
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,813
It smells.

213
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,065
You squeezed too tight.

214
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,971
Look at all those fireflies!

215
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,028
Setsuko, close your eyes and say "aah."

216
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,613
What for?

217
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,657
Just say "aah."

218
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,504
Fruit drops!

219
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,175
Fruit drops, fruit drops!

220
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,355
I almost swallowed it.

221
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:29,093
- We're back.

222
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:30,240
- What took you so long?

223
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,504
Did you thank the lady?

224
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:36,839
Yes, Ma'am.

225
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,552
That looked good.

226
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:14,961
Seita, don't you have to go to school?

227
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:20,383
Kobe Steel where I was mobilized was destroyed.

228
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,678
And my school burned, so there is no place left to go.

229
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,473
And did you send your father a letter?

230
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,476
Yes, in care of Kure Naval Base.

231
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,811
When?

232
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,939
Over ten days ago, after we came here.

233
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,150
That's strange.

234
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,696
He hasn't replied to me either.

235
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,033
Setsuko, be sure to return those.

236
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,961
How is the war situation?

237
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,297
Getting worse, I'm afraid.

238
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:04,176
Factories must step up for those that burned.

239
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,680
All we hear is "Gear up for final battle."

240
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:13,769
Food rations keep getting worse too.

241
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:18,524
We're all suffering in this war.

242
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:24,155
My girl is also working for our country.

243
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,616
You must eat and put on strength.

244
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,876
Not again.

245
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,712
Taking in two more must be tough.

246
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:42,851
But poor things.

247
00:30:42,871 --> 00:30:45,874
They're still so young.

248
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,262
Is your heat rash itchy?

249
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:50,046
It's hot in here.

250
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:51,714
I hate shelters.

251
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,550
Hang in there.

252
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,260
I'm here for you.

253
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:07,619
- Want to go to the beach?

254
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:09,009
- Yes!

255
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:10,399
Yes, let's go!

256
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,594
It's all vegetable fields now!

257
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,988
What are they doing?

258
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,656
Getting salt water.

259
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:33,108
- Not enough salt or soy sauce at home.

260
00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:35,068
- I see.

261
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,329
Now take off your clothes!

262
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,277
Might be a bit cold.

263
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,321
It's cold!

264
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,668
- Isn't this soothing on your rash?

265
00:33:13,688 --> 00:33:15,273
- Uh-huh.

266
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,377
It's a huge bathtub!

267
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,129
Hey you!

268
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:34,345
Wait!

269
00:33:39,694 --> 00:33:41,196
I'm a bear!

270
00:33:41,216 --> 00:33:42,718
I'm going to eat you!

271
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:09,588
Snip, snip, snip.

272
00:34:13,895 --> 00:34:15,376
Look.

273
00:34:15,396 --> 00:34:16,877
Somebody is sleeping.

274
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,690
Don't look at that.

275
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,696
Summertime, I'll teach you how to swim.

276
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,576
But I'll get hungry if I swim.

277
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,666
But I'll get hungry if I swim.

278
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,843
Seita!

279
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:57,710
Setsuko!

280
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,461
Come indoors!

281
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,396
You must be hungry!

282
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:11,358
There are ice-cold drinks too!

283
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:43,006
Mama!

284
00:35:43,026 --> 00:35:44,841
Did you wait long?

285
00:35:44,861 --> 00:35:46,676
I'm so glad you came.

286
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,229
How are you doing?

287
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:50,950
I'm doing fine.

288
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,513
Everyone is nice here.

289
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,860
I'm hungry.

290
00:35:56,831 --> 00:35:58,333
Get up.

291
00:35:58,353 --> 00:35:59,855
There's an air raid coming.

292
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:01,753
I'm tired.

293
00:36:01,773 --> 00:36:03,525
I want a piggyback ride.

294
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,331
To the shelters!

295
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:22,054
Your mother won't need her kimono anymore.

296
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,390
Why not exchange it for rice?

297
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,895
I've been slowly trading my things for more food too.

298
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,940
This should get about 15-kg.

299
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,692
15-kg...?!

300
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:40,197
You must also eat to build a strong body and go to war.

301
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,408
This is worth 15-kg?

302
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:46,578
I'm sure your mother will be happier this way.

303
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,664
I'll take these now.

304
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,791
No!

305
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,419
Setsuko, you're awake.

306
00:36:53,638 --> 00:36:55,932
They're Mama's!

307
00:36:55,952 --> 00:36:58,246
They're Mama's!

308
00:36:58,393 --> 00:36:59,874
No!

309
00:36:59,894 --> 00:37:01,375
You can't take them!

310
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,054
Setsuko, let go.

311
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,850
No, no, no!

312
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:09,466
Setsuko!

313
00:37:09,486 --> 00:37:10,883
Setsuko!

314
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,978
Isn't this fine rice?

315
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,983
Setsuko, we'll have steamed rice tonight.

316
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,655
These are for you two to keep.

317
00:38:11,216 --> 00:38:12,343
Look!

318
00:38:12,363 --> 00:38:13,490
It's rice, Setsuko.

319
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,637
Here you go.

320
00:38:27,524 --> 00:38:30,486
The two are working late.

321
00:38:30,506 --> 00:38:33,468
Too bad they can't eat while it's hot.

322
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,731
Setsuko, isn't this rice yummy?

323
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,402
I want more!

324
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,613
Yes, dear.

325
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,786
Setsuko eats a lot when it's rice.

326
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,996
It tastes so good!

327
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,878
What's the matter?

328
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,464
I don't want porridge.

329
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,884
Aren't there any pickled plums?

330
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,179
You know they're long gone.

331
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,390
Here's your lunch.

332
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,724
Thank you.

333
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,059
Have a nice day.

334
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:18,137
- I'll be off.

335
00:39:18,157 --> 00:39:19,179
- You take care.

336
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,609
We'll have rice balls for lunch, so eat.

337
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:24,706
Enough!

338
00:39:24,726 --> 00:39:26,561
Our lunch will be porridge!

339
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:33,912
You loafers expect to eat the same as those working for our country?!

340
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:41,461
Seita, you're old enough to understand about helping out.

341
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:45,289
You don't share your rice, but now you want more of ours.

342
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:48,417
That's unacceptable!

343
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:02,774
Give you a little bit of rice, and already you're spoiled!

344
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,485
But that's our rice.

345
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,947
Are you saying your aunt isn't fair?

346
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:11,962
You sure talk big.

347
00:40:11,982 --> 00:40:14,819
This is what I get for taking in two orphans?

348
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,872
Well then.

349
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:19,615
From now on, we'll eat separately.

350
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:22,117
That should be fair.

351
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,506
Seita, you have relatives in Tokyo, don't you?

352
00:40:26,935 --> 00:40:29,125
One's on your mother's side?

353
00:40:29,145 --> 00:40:31,335
Why don't you write to them?

354
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,432
Nishinomiya could be firebombed anytime.

355
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,143
But I don't have their address.

356
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,195
Let's hurry home.

357
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:51,239
Yes, Daddy is waiting for us.

358
00:40:51,876 --> 00:40:54,317
Frogs are singing.

359
00:40:54,337 --> 00:40:56,778
Let's go home.

360
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,501
Sorry for the long wait!

361
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,131
What is it?

362
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:09,978
I'm hungry.

363
00:41:09,998 --> 00:41:11,625
I'm thirsty too.

364
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:12,844
Alrighty.

365
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,184
Here, have a fruit drop.

366
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:24,064
Mama had 7,000 yen saved in the bank.

367
00:41:24,867 --> 00:41:26,668
7,000!

368
00:41:26,688 --> 00:41:28,489
That's plenty to live on.

369
00:41:28,509 --> 00:41:30,310
We're going to be all right.

370
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:37,911
I'm telling Dad to write back soon, because Setsuko is waiting.

371
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,090
You two are in luck.

372
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:55,137
You can't find such a good stove nowadays at any price.

373
00:41:55,273 --> 00:41:58,443
Items are scarce, especially hardware.

374
00:41:58,463 --> 00:42:01,633
Can't get those anywhere!

375
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:07,566
I'll take that comb, and do you have an umbrella?

376
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:09,537
I'm afraid not.

377
00:42:09,557 --> 00:42:10,975
Oh, but wait.

378
00:42:11,789 --> 00:42:16,357
Rain, rain, fall, fall.

379
00:42:16,377 --> 00:42:20,945
So happy my big brother came With an umbrella to take me home.

380
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:25,417
Splish-splish, splash-splash, la-la-la!

381
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,306
Good fire, huh?

382
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,183
Just be careful with that.

383
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,434
We will!

384
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,773
What's up with those two?

385
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,317
They're cooking on their own now.

386
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,560
That's very noble of them.

387
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,520
More, please.

388
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:57,657
Mama, were you harsh on them again?

389
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,744
So I was, but they won't apologize.

390
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,956
Then they bought cooking equipment, just to spite me!

391
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,292
I'm done!

392
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,800
That's bad manners, Seita.

393
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,095
You can relax too.

394
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,649
That's for two.

395
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:31,650
That's it?!

396
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:35,654
The next ration should be in July.

397
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,085
Let me do it.

398
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,111
Is it sweet?

399
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,412
I can taste so many flavors!

400
00:45:49,924 --> 00:45:52,510
Grape, strawberry, melon, mint...

401
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,116
Setsuko, you can have it all.

402
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,264
It's all gone!

403
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:15,146
Gone to bed without washing their dishes!

404
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,148
Doing as they please.

405
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,860
Those brats are so annoying!

406
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:24,030
Not again!

407
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,407
Mama!

408
00:46:25,543 --> 00:46:27,587
Seita!

409
00:46:27,607 --> 00:46:29,651
Others here are working for our country.

410
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,872
At least stop that girl's crying!

411
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,128
With the nightly raids and crying, how can we sleep?!

412
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:09,200
Chubu military area information.

413
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:14,122
Enemy bombers are flying north along the Kii Channel.

414
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,791
Are you going to the cave again?

415
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:21,588
You're old enough to help fire fighting duties!

416
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,595
All clear!

417
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:35,717
I want to go home.

418
00:47:35,737 --> 00:47:38,385
I hate living with our aunt.

419
00:47:40,493 --> 00:47:41,765
We don't have a home.

420
00:47:41,785 --> 00:47:43,057
It was burned.

421
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:56,414
E - D - C - D - E - A - G E - E - E - D - C - D Let's sing!

422
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:03,546
Carp streamers Up higher than the roof.

423
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:10,428
The big black carp is the Dad.

424
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,930
Stop it!

425
00:48:12,316 --> 00:48:13,964
Are you crazy?

426
00:48:13,984 --> 00:48:15,632
We're at war!

427
00:48:15,652 --> 00:48:17,300
I'll get yelled for that!

428
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:22,732
You pests bring us nothing but trouble!

429
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,610
You're useless in raids.

430
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,572
If you're so scared, then go live in that cave!

431
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,828
You know what?

432
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,081
This can be our home.

433
00:48:40,094 --> 00:48:41,811
Nobody comes here.

434
00:48:41,831 --> 00:48:43,548
It's sturdy.

435
00:48:43,568 --> 00:48:45,285
We can do whatever we want.

436
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,757
It's all right to do that?

437
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:14,024
Thank you for everything.

438
00:49:14,044 --> 00:49:15,817
We're going.

439
00:49:16,005 --> 00:49:17,152
Going...?

440
00:49:17,172 --> 00:49:18,319
Where to?

441
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,790
We're not sure yet.

442
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:24,994
Well, take care then.

443
00:49:25,014 --> 00:49:26,829
Goodbye, Setsuko!

444
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,527
This will be the kitchen.

445
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,740
This is the front door.

446
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,870
Where's the bathroom going to be?

447
00:49:59,882 --> 00:50:01,530
That can be anywhere.

448
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:03,198
I'll go with you.

449
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,011
Thank you for the cart!

450
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,388
Just leave it there.

451
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:24,103
Could you sell us more straw and some food?

452
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:28,107
There isn't much to sell, but sure.

453
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:55,802
There you go!

454
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:24,196
- My mouth is watering.

455
00:51:24,216 --> 00:51:25,531
- I'm hungry!

456
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,944
Heard you could eat those too.

457
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,487
Frogs?

458
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,740
They say they're good.

459
00:52:02,171 --> 00:52:03,401
I'll do the rest.

460
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:04,651
You go wait in the net.

461
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,090
What is it?

462
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,301
I left my toothbrush.

463
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:21,179
Then don't brush tonight.

464
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:26,195
You'll get bug bites.

465
00:52:26,215 --> 00:52:28,092
Stay inside the net.

466
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:30,396
It's dark and I'm scared.

467
00:52:35,954 --> 00:52:37,310
I'll go for a pee.

468
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:38,686
Want to go too?

469
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,620
It's a kamikaze plane.

470
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,456
Looks like a firefly.

471
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,999
It does.

472
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:53,378
Hey, let's catch fireflies.

473
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,381
Get in.

474
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:12,480
I can see your face!

475
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:13,690
I can see you too.

476
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,195
Look, it's a hairpin.

477
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:27,578
Now, let's see a firefly light show!

478
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,261
Before you were born, I went to a naval review.

479
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,180
A naval review?

480
00:54:27,357 --> 00:54:29,881
Dad was on the cruiser Maya.

481
00:54:29,901 --> 00:54:32,425
The entire combined fleet was there!

482
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:13,893
Iron castle afloat on the sea.

483
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:18,022
For offense and defense, we trust in thee.

484
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,149
Enemy attack!

485
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,996
I wonder where Dad is fighting now.

486
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,820
No, let go!

487
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:44,942
What's that?

488
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,748
It's a grave.

489
00:56:47,768 --> 00:56:50,396
Mama's also in a grave, right?

490
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:58,372
Auntie told me.

491
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:03,127
Mama is already dead and in a grave.

492
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,243
We'll go to her grave one day.

493
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:41,457
Setsuko, do you remember the cemetery near Nunobiki?

494
00:57:41,843 --> 00:57:44,534
That's where Mama is.

495
00:57:44,554 --> 00:57:47,245
Under a big camphor tree...

496
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:50,800
Why do fireflies have to die so soon?

497
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:32,049
Hey, somebody is living here.

498
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,926
Homeless, maybe?

499
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,053
What if he's here?

500
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:39,765
There's even a swing.

501
00:58:39,901 --> 00:58:40,965
A kid lives here.

502
00:58:40,985 --> 00:58:42,049
What's this?

503
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,895
May you rest in peace!

504
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,567
Wish this were real.

505
00:58:50,078 --> 00:58:51,288
Hey!

506
00:58:51,308 --> 00:58:52,518
It says "Setsuko".

507
00:58:52,748 --> 00:58:53,958
Look!

508
00:58:53,978 --> 00:58:55,188
Dried frogs!

509
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,283
They eat those?!

510
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:01,912
Wonder if the evacuated boys also eat stuff like this?

511
00:59:03,759 --> 00:59:04,635
Yuck!

512
00:59:04,655 --> 00:59:05,531
Ground soybeans!

513
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,626
Worse than what we eat!

514
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,378
It's a ghost!

515
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:15,259
Wait!

516
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:17,970
Wait for me!

517
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:27,521
And we've already traded all of our mother's kimono for rice.

518
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:29,732
You used to take money...

519
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,737
This isn't about kimono or money.

520
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:39,784
I'm a farmer, but even I don't have extra food to share.

521
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,793
Any other relatives?

522
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,295
We can't contact them.

523
00:59:51,807 --> 00:59:53,622
Then be wise.

524
00:59:53,642 --> 00:59:55,457
Go back to your aunt's.

525
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,928
Everything is rationed nowadays.

526
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,597
We must rely on neighborhood groups.

527
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,518
Tell her you're sorry and want to stay.

528
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:14,819
Thank you, but we'll try elsewhere.

529
01:00:16,164 --> 01:00:18,125
You're a navy man's son!

530
01:00:18,145 --> 01:00:20,106
Be strong!

531
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,482
It's okay?

532
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:34,190
Oh, no!

533
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:38,420
You must eat your beans and millet.

534
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:41,382
You got to eat to grow big!

535
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:43,801
Seita?

536
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:50,349
Something is wrong with my tummy.

537
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,809
Are you cold?

538
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:55,813
The diarrhea doesn't go away.

539
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:02,653
You bastard!

540
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:05,322
Forgive me!

541
01:03:06,376 --> 01:03:07,669
I'm sorry!

542
01:03:07,689 --> 01:03:08,982
Please let me go!

543
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:13,580
Wanted some sugar for my sick sister!

544
01:03:13,758 --> 01:03:15,927
Shut up!

545
01:03:15,947 --> 01:03:18,116
Stealing crops is a serious crime in wartime!

546
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:23,007
You're not going to get away with this!

547
01:03:34,279 --> 01:03:35,739
What?

548
01:03:35,759 --> 01:03:37,219
Even dug up these small ones?

549
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,858
So you're the crop thief!

550
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:42,359
Seita!

551
01:03:43,371 --> 01:03:45,353
Please forgive me.

552
01:03:45,373 --> 01:03:47,355
I won't do it again!

553
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,367
No, we're going to the police!

554
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,121
I'm sending you off to jail!

555
01:03:54,257 --> 01:03:56,239
My sister is really sick!

556
01:03:56,259 --> 01:03:58,241
She has no one but me!

557
01:03:58,386 --> 01:03:59,742
Seita!

558
01:03:59,762 --> 01:04:01,118
Seita!

559
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,964
Seita!

560
01:04:05,935 --> 01:04:07,458
Seita.

561
01:04:07,478 --> 01:04:09,001
Seita...

562
01:04:14,152 --> 01:04:16,050
Understood.

563
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:17,968
I'll talk to him and file a report.

564
01:04:18,114 --> 01:04:19,908
That will be enough.

565
01:04:19,928 --> 01:04:21,722
You can go now.

566
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:24,068
But...

567
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,446
You've beaten him enough.

568
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,574
It's an injurious assault...

569
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,535
...to a minor!

570
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,579
I will be going then...!

571
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:42,586
Tonight's air raid was in Fukui.

572
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:48,175
Why not come in for a drink of water?

573
01:04:58,186 --> 01:04:59,395
Setsuko.

574
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,946
Seita!

575
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,505
Seita.

576
01:05:33,773 --> 01:05:36,714
Where does it hurt?

577
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:39,675
You must see a doctor and get a shot.

578
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:46,525
Setsuko!

579
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:58,162
Seita, I want to go to the toilet.

580
01:06:01,676 --> 01:06:02,761
- Can you hold it?

581
01:06:02,781 --> 01:06:03,866
- Uh-huh.

582
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:05,961
Get on my back.

583
01:06:14,147 --> 01:06:17,234
The brother went to the mountain to cut firewood.

584
01:06:17,254 --> 01:06:20,341
The grandmother...

585
01:06:30,747 --> 01:06:31,393
Hurry!

586
01:06:31,413 --> 01:06:32,059
Hurry!

587
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,068
Setsuko, let's eat.

588
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:17,523
Today's pumpkin is good!

589
01:07:17,543 --> 01:07:19,816
It tastes like real bean jelly.

590
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:22,746
I hate bean jelly.

591
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:27,584
Come on, Dad'll get mad at me if you don't eat.

592
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:31,380
I'll help you, so cheer up and eat!

593
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,886
When you get well, we'll go to the beach again.

594
01:08:19,522 --> 01:08:20,649
Go, go!

595
01:08:20,669 --> 01:08:21,796
Yay!

596
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:47,789
Bang!

597
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,902
This will bring us food, Setsuko!

598
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,205
Seita...?

599
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,754
Seita?

600
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:41,176
You say this was your Mama's?

601
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:45,389
How can this cheap flimsy thing be a keepsake?!

602
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:55,982
Setsuko?

603
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:58,694
Setsuko?

604
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:26,722
Setsuko!

605
01:10:34,657 --> 01:10:36,430
Seita...

606
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:38,223
Water...

607
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:49,786
Breathe in.

608
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:52,289
Breathe out.

609
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:58,795
And she's had diarrhea for many days now.

610
01:10:58,973 --> 01:11:01,726
The rash isn't from the heat.

611
01:11:01,746 --> 01:11:04,499
Seawater just hurts her skin.

612
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,973
She's weak from malnutrition.

613
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,142
Thus, the diarrhea.

614
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,101
Okay, next!

615
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:15,479
Can you give her medicine or a shot?

616
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,647
I hate shots!

617
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:21,443
Please give her some medical treatment.

618
01:11:21,579 --> 01:11:24,186
Medicine won't help.

619
01:11:24,206 --> 01:11:26,813
All she needs is nutrition.

620
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,825
Nutrition...?

621
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:30,994
What's wrong?

622
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,205
But where can I get that?!

623
01:12:22,098 --> 01:12:24,267
Am I hungry.

624
01:12:24,287 --> 01:12:26,456
What do you want to eat?

625
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:32,097
Tempura, sashimi, tokoroten noodles...

626
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:33,390
Anything else?

627
01:12:33,568 --> 01:12:35,299
Ice cream.

628
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:37,050
And...

629
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:40,355
I want fruit drops again.

630
01:12:40,825 --> 01:12:42,306
Fruit drops?

631
01:12:42,326 --> 01:12:43,807
Alrighty.

632
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,740
I'll go withdraw all our savings.

633
01:12:50,918 --> 01:12:53,484
I don't need anything.

634
01:12:53,504 --> 01:12:56,070
Please stay home with me.

635
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:58,238
Don't go!

636
01:12:58,258 --> 01:13:00,156
Don't go!

637
01:13:00,176 --> 01:13:02,074
Don't go!

638
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,171
Don't worry, Setsuko.

639
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:09,759
I'll go buy rice and nutritious food for you...

640
01:13:10,354 --> 01:13:12,878
Then, I'll never ever leave.

641
01:13:12,898 --> 01:13:15,422
I'll always be with you.

642
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:18,602
I promise.

643
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,125
Here's 3,000 yen.

644
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:44,336
A typhoon is coming?

645
01:13:44,472 --> 01:13:47,016
What a joke!

646
01:13:47,036 --> 01:13:49,580
Our "divine wind" comes after we've surrendered.

647
01:13:49,727 --> 01:13:51,187
Surrendered...?

648
01:13:51,207 --> 01:13:52,667
We lost the war?!

649
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,305
You didn't know?

650
01:13:58,986 --> 01:14:00,655
Is it true?

651
01:14:00,675 --> 01:14:02,344
The Great Empire of Japan lost?

652
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,607
Yes, it was unconditional surrender.

653
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:08,234
Where's our fleet?

654
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:09,569
They're long gone.

655
01:14:09,705 --> 01:14:11,395
All sunk!

656
01:14:11,415 --> 01:14:13,105
Not even a ship left.

657
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,032
What?!

658
01:14:14,543 --> 01:14:16,650
Dad's cruiser too?!

659
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:18,777
Is that why we got no reply?!

660
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:20,497
How should I know?

661
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:23,708
Strange boy.

662
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,464
Dad, I hate you!

663
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,607
I'm so hungry.

664
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,489
Dad.

665
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:03,999
Now even Dad's dead.

666
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,544
Now even Dad's dead.

667
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,797
Now even Dad's...

668
01:15:53,851 --> 01:15:56,354
Setsuko, sorry I'm so late.

669
01:15:56,374 --> 01:15:58,877
I'll make you rice gruel.

670
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:00,930
It went up.

671
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:05,393
It went down.

672
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:10,190
Oh, it stopped.

673
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:13,151
Even got chicken and eggs!

674
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,197
And there's also...

675
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,041
What's that in your mouth?!

676
01:16:32,306 --> 01:16:33,891
This is a marble.

677
01:16:33,911 --> 01:16:35,496
It's not a fruit drop!

678
01:16:37,812 --> 01:16:39,919
You're getting something better today.

679
01:16:39,939 --> 01:16:42,046
Your favorite.

680
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:48,186
Seita, this is for you.

681
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,275
What is it, Setsuko?

682
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,444
It's steamed rice.

683
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:01,324
Here's some cooked soy pulp.

684
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,787
Please eat.

685
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,585
You're not having any?

686
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,462
Setsuko...!

687
01:17:23,816 --> 01:17:25,102
See?

688
01:17:25,122 --> 01:17:26,408
It's watermelon.

689
01:17:26,428 --> 01:17:27,714
I didn't steal this either.

690
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:41,698
Here, have some.

691
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,249
It's yummy...

692
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:57,788
Hold on.

693
01:17:57,808 --> 01:17:59,706
I'll make you rice gruel with eggs.

694
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:09,517
I'll leave these here for you.

695
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,145
Okay?

696
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,023
Seita...

697
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:17,901
Thank you.

698
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:46,221
Setsuko never woke up.

699
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:41,192
Here's a special ration of charcoal.

700
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,988
You can cremate the child on temple grounds.

701
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:50,410
Undress the body, and use dry husks to start a good fire.

702
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,871
The weather is so fine today!

703
01:19:58,846 --> 01:20:01,244
- Nothing has changed!

704
01:20:01,264 --> 01:20:03,662
- It's great to be back home!

705
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:10,263
We can finally listen to the gramophone!

706
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:17,270
I missed this lovely view!

707
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,984
Come home soon!

708
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:43,953
Next morning...

709
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:48,791
I put Setsuko's ashes into the drops tin and left.

710
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:52,086
I never went to the cave again.

711
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:00,970
Seita!

712
01:25:18,248 --> 01:25:19,034
- It's late.

713
01:25:19,054 --> 01:25:19,840
Go to sleep now.

714
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:20,646
- Okay.

715
01:25:53,594 --> 01:26:00,594
A Team Nanban (594mgnav) Release
