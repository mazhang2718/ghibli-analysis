00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:35,285
Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DYMP, Walt Disney Japan, Mitsubishi, Toho and KDDI presents In this world, there's an invisible magic circle.

2
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:44,347
So you did go out with him!

3
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:45,452
What?

4
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,426
There's inside and outside.

5
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,763
Capture the movement.

6
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,734
It's hard.

7
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:56,548
Right?

8
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,152
Let's see.

9
00:00:58,172 --> 00:00:59,591
Hey, no looking!

10
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,895
These people are inside.

11
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,776
And I'm outside.

12
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,154
But it doesn't matter.

13
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,782
How's it coming?

14
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,831
Um, I...kind of still drawing.

15
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,125
Let me have a look.

16
00:01:35,147 --> 00:01:35,961
Oh, no.

17
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:36,795
Are you okay?

18
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,473
Hey, hey...

19
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,318
I...

20
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,864
I'm not sure about myself.

21
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,676
Anna...

22
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,013
You're fine now.

23
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,026
Oh, I'm so glad.

24
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:21,882
Thank you, Doctor.

25
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,146
Anna, do you feel all right now?

26
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,522
I'm fine.

27
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,817
You looked like you were in agony.

28
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,861
Where was your inhaler?

29
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,698
I cost you money again.

30
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,242
Why do you say that?

31
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,206
Oh, Miyoko.

32
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:46,719
I brought Anna's bag.

33
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,617
Her notebook is inside.

34
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,212
Why, thank you.

35
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:51,954
We were just nearby.

36
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:53,539
If there's anything else...

37
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,550
Wait...

38
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,346
Has Anna been getting along with you?

39
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,848
She tells me nothing about school.

40
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,725
She's okay.

41
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,852
But she's very quiet.

42
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:07,489
Quiet?

43
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:08,260
More like...

44
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,065
Hey, don't.

45
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,859
We're just a bit loud.

46
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,863
Well, take care.

47
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,492
Ever the worrywart, your mother.

48
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,414
Mother...?

49
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,712
She's probably a hermit at school.

50
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:36,007
It's true that stress can trigger asthma.

51
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,302
Meanwhile, my husband's off on a business trip.

52
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,057
Maybe he and I are partly to blame, too.

53
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,393
12 years old...

54
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,729
It's a difficult age.

55
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,482
Have you noticed anything about her?

56
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,487
She...always has an ordinary face.

57
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,573
Ordinary face?

58
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,827
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,624
Like she won't show her emotions...

60
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,753
She used to be more expressive.

61
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:17,340
But these days, I don't even know...

62
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:24,848
Maybe it's as if she weren't my daughter.

63
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:30,687
You may want to send her somewhere to get better.

64
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:46,620
7:03 Departure for KUSHIRO Say, Anna...

65
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,500
Do you remember Uncle and Aunt Oiwa?

66
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,630
The air is very clean where they live.

67
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:04,513
It'll help your condition to spend some time there.

68
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:10,602
I can't go with you but they'll take care of you.

69
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,815
Be a good girl, eat well...

70
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,025
and come back nice and happy.

71
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,865
She worries too much.

72
00:05:40,865 --> 00:06:11,538
When marnie was there Oh, here she is.

73
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,832
Anna.

74
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,046
Remember us?

75
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,216
No, but Auntie told me all about you.

76
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,843
I'm Anna Sasaki.

77
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,710
I hope I'm not much trouble.

78
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,420
Thank you for having me.

79
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,725
Our pleasure.

80
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,435
Auntie?

81
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,270
She means Yoriko.

82
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,661
Get on in.

83
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:42,433
Sorry it's a bit of a clunker.

84
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,579
Sorry it's tight in here.

85
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,247
I don't mind at all.

86
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:57,636
This area's changed since I was last here.

87
00:06:57,656 --> 00:07:00,159
All these new shops.

88
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,132
Where we're headed is a nice, relaxing place.

89
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,803
But since the highway was built, people stopped coming.

90
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,990
They still haven't fixed that pothole!

91
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,120
I hear you have asthma?

92
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,205
Uh, yes...

93
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,124
The wind here will fix you up in no time.

94
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:48,166
Nice place, huh?

95
00:07:48,186 --> 00:07:50,001
Bet you'd like Auntie to see it, too.

96
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,638
What's that over there?

97
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,015
On the cliff.

98
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:56,591
Oh, that's a silo.

99
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:59,010
It's for storing feed for livestock.

100
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,190
Hasn't been used in decades, though.

101
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,986
Now the village kids use it for dares.

102
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,989
They say there are ghosts there.

103
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,991
Dear, please!

104
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,660
He loves stories like that.

105
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,787
Best to stay away from there.

106
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,044
Look, that's our house over there.

107
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,261
Here, mind taking this in?

108
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,512
What's this?

109
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,016
Why would you accept this?

110
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,686
It's too much for us to eat.

111
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,523
He's always accepting gifts without thinking...

112
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,695
Our kids are all grown up and moved out.

113
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,572
Make yourself at home.

114
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,489
Thank you.

115
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,451
Let's see, these go where...

116
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,536
Excuse me.

117
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,757
You must think it's an odd house.

118
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,092
No, it's a lovely home.

119
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,472
No need for being modest!

120
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,976
Your room's upstairs.

121
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,438
It was my daughter's room.

122
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,320
It'd be sad to clear everything, so I left it as it was.

123
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,280
I see.

124
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,909
She's a yoga teacher in Tokyo now.

125
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,745
I'm thinking of trying it myself.

126
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,750
Oh, and feel free to use the closet and shelves.

127
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,418
Oh, thank you.

128
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:56,725
'Write me how things are, whatever you please.

129
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:59,575
Yoriko' Postcards, how quaint!

130
00:09:59,595 --> 00:10:02,425
You should write her.

131
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,646
Come here for a sec!

132
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,272
Corning!

133
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,942
He can be so pushy.

134
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,652
See you later.

135
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,493
Seems a little stuffy in here.

136
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:31,893
Oh wow!

137
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,570
Feels nice.

138
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,322
I've arrived safely.

139
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,533
It's quite nice here.

140
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,162
Mr. and Mrs.Oiwa are both very kind.

141
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:17,844
To Yoriko Sasaki These are delicious.

142
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,014
Sorry, my hands are full.

143
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,850
Um, I'm going to mail this in.

144
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,519
Sure, go on.

145
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:27,979
Won't you try this?

146
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,564
Later.

147
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,066
Okay, I'll save it for dessert.

148
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,870
By the way, there's a shortcut by the parking lot.

149
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,038
Oh, thank you.

150
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:53,254
SHORTCUT This is the shortcut?

151
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,915
Boys just drive me mad!

152
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,833
It's tough being class president.

153
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,544
Wait, I need to drop off a letter.

154
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,553
Hey, who's that?

155
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,333
What is it?

156
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,463
That mansion seems familiar.

157
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,998
I wonder if anyone lives here.

158
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,756
Excuse me...

159
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,357
What a big house.

160
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,933
I guess there's no one here.

161
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,515
Oh, no...

162
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,290
Thank you.

163
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,363
He's a bear.

164
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:19,885
Or maybe a sea lion.

165
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,884
Sounds like an adventure!

166
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,429
Completely different in high tide, isn't it?

167
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,890
It's the power of the moon.

168
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,269
But imagine that, Toichi giving a girl a ride on his boat.

169
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:02,616
He's actually a good guy.

170
00:17:02,636 --> 00:17:04,848
Just not much of a talker.

171
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,904
You should ask him for a ride again.

172
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,615
Ask him for a ride.

173
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,743
I will.

174
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,790
But it's best you stay away from 'The Marsh House'.

175
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,210
How come?

176
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,671
Ghosts.

177
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,505
Not again!

178
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,967
I'll get some wine.

179
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,886
Looked like no one lives there.

180
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,596
Not now, anyway.

181
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,434
Used to be a vacation home for some foreigners.

182
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,813
Then it changed hands a few times.

183
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,899
But it's been vacant for a while now.

184
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,610
I see...

185
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,015
Someone's there.

186
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,517
Have you finished them yet?

187
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,687
What Mrs.Kadoya asked for.

188
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,356
Oh...almost done.

189
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:09,930
Hey, Anna.

190
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,847
Going out?

191
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,193
Yes.

192
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,862
Just finish them already...

193
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,366
I'm going to go sketch.

194
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,867
Sure, go on.

195
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,035
Thank you.

196
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:30,211
Yoriko was worried about her, but she looks fine to me.

197
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,714
As long as she's having fun and eating well.

198
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,549
That's for sure.

199
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,391
All the trash you pick up will be collected here.

200
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,893
Everyone listen!

201
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,395
Now begin!

202
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,566
Look, it's Toichi.

203
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,984
Toichi 'The Quite One'!

204
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,405
Toichi who only talks once a decade!

205
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,908
Hey, I said we're not going there until later!

206
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,077
We're just checking it out!

207
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,286
See ya!

208
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,581
Perhaps we'll hear from you next time!

209
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,977
I'm going out.

210
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,313
Wait, Anna.

211
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,985
I have a little errand, so hold on.

212
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,655
Yes.

213
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,161
He should be delivering these himself.

214
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,164
'I'm allergic to that lady' he says!

215
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,751
But Mrs.Kadoya's been wanting to meet you.

216
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,838
Their daughter Nobuko is a year older than you.

217
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,677
Nobuko is at cram school today.

218
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,679
Oh, that's too bad.

219
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,296
This must be Anna.

220
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:48,756
Nice to meet you.

221
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,020
Oh, um...Hello.

222
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,023
Ah, so you draw, I see?

223
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,691
Show me next time.

224
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,819
No, I'm not very good.

225
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:06,283
Oh, you should go to the Tanabata Festival with Nobuko tomorrow.

226
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:08,296
Great idea!

227
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:10,194
I should still have my daughter's yukata.

228
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,207
You can wear it to the festival.

229
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,042
But...

230
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,545
Yes.

231
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:19,203
I'll let Nobuko know.

232
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:20,538
Now come in.

233
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,508
Where'd I put it...

234
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,552
Uh, actually I...

235
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:26,169
Oh, you're going sketching.

236
00:22:26,189 --> 00:22:27,546
Go ahead!

237
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,892
She'll look great!

238
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,061
Ready, and..

239
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:35,219
This one, too.

240
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,220
Got it.

241
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,566
I won't look good in it.

242
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,402
Maybe she shouldn't have.

243
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,249
He's not here.

244
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:24,143
Bye.

245
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:25,269
See you tomorrow.

246
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,311
The tide is out.

247
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,001
Again.

248
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,513
I don't like festivals.

249
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,022
Hey, let's go.

250
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,524
Wait for me.

251
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:45,161
Here you go.

252
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:46,308
Thank you.

253
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:47,476
Here's some candy.

254
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:48,519
Thanks.

255
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,367
I wish I was wearing a yukata, too.

256
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,369
At least you're comfortable.

257
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:56,902
Mom says I should wear those.

258
00:24:56,922 --> 00:24:58,278
It's not fair.

259
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,207
I think it looks cute.

260
00:25:00,384 --> 00:25:01,198
What?

261
00:25:01,218 --> 00:25:02,032
No way!

262
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,212
It's boring and tacky...

263
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,048
So Anna, where are you from?

264
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,883
From Sapporo.

265
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,220
Cool, I bet the city has great shopping.

266
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,389
Maybe lots of cute boys, too?

267
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,224
You be quiet.

268
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,392
Sure, sure.

269
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,395
Not much to choose from here in the countryside.

270
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,398
Why'd you come out here?

271
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,400
Well...

272
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:27,892
What's this?

273
00:25:27,912 --> 00:25:29,227
Nobuko!

274
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,362
What is it?

275
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,908
He's always making the same mistakes.

276
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,077
I'll warn him next time.

277
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,377
There it is.

278
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,004
Will my wish come true?

279
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:50,090
Can I have a candle?

280
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,717
Here you go.

281
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,770
Write your wish on this.

282
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,441
My wish...

283
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,779
Ow!

284
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,947
Sorry about that.

285
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,327
Anna!

286
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:20,465
Hey, where were you?

287
00:26:20,485 --> 00:26:22,321
I was looking for you.

288
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,458
Oh, your wish.

289
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:26,293
Let's see...

290
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:32,299
'I wish for a normal life everyday' 'Normal'?

291
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,135
Anna, what do you mean by normal?

292
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,345
Uh, well...

293
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,930
You see, urn...

294
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,848
Hey, your eye color!

295
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:41,809
What?

296
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,103
It's really pretty.

297
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,979
It's a bit blue, like a foreign...

298
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,648
Leave me alone!

299
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,567
All of you!

300
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,488
Huh...?

301
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,481
Uh...

302
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:58,482
I mean...

303
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,663
I see what you mean by normal.

304
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:08,001
But there's no use pretending to be normal.

305
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:12,005
After all, you look like just what you are.

306
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,344
Okay, now let's drop it.

307
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,680
You should join us next...

308
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,516
Anna!

309
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,518
Hey, watch it!

310
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,697
Like just what I am...

311
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,141
Like just what I am...

312
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:12,024
Not good looking, slow, moody, unpleasant...

313
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,569
That's why...

314
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,072
I don't know myself anymore.

315
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,243
That's why everyone...

316
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:28,113
We don't have long to live.

317
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:30,574
Typically, you're the ones who...

318
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,753
Still talking about that?

319
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,547
We already settled this matter.

320
00:28:35,682 --> 00:28:36,955
We're not blaming you.

321
00:28:36,975 --> 00:28:38,248
It's just that...

322
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:40,000
I've already told you.

323
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,585
It's not about money.

324
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,263
I feel bad for her, but...

325
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,099
It'll be best for her if you two...

326
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,287
I'd better get home.

327
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,481
Did someone row it here?

328
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,207
It's stuck!

329
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,549
Throw me the rope!

330
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,217
The rope?

331
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,555
Hurry!

332
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,254
Are you okay?

333
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:24,206
Yeah.

334
00:31:24,226 --> 00:31:25,583
Oh, urn...

335
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,262
Are you a real person?

336
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,431
Don't let anyone hear.

337
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,435
You look like the girl I saw in my dreams.

338
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,270
Dreams?

339
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,953
Thanks.

340
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,792
It's not a dream.

341
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,467
What's your name?

342
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:08,969
Anna.

343
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:12,222
I'm would like to get to know you.

344
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,974
What about you?

345
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,143
Yes.

346
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,771
Have you seen me before?

347
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,815
Yes.

348
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,483
Often.

349
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:26,560
I just got here.

350
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,646
How long have you been here?

351
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,824
I've been here for ages...

352
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,717
Look at this, the marsh at night.

353
00:32:49,186 --> 00:32:51,334
How beautiful.

354
00:32:51,354 --> 00:32:53,502
Say, let's go down for a closer look.

355
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,598
Madam.

356
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,017
I know.

357
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,520
By the way, where's that child?

358
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,023
Was she not in her room?

359
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,528
I need to get back.

360
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,655
Were they talking about you?

361
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,698
Yes.

362
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,536
Usually I'm in bed by this hour.

363
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,541
Come on, I'll row you back.

364
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,294
So it was your boat.

365
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,714
Yes, I left it for you on purpose.

366
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,554
But I thought you'd row a little better.

367
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,590
I know.

368
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,050
So did I.

369
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,065
You're my precious secret.

370
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,694
I haven't told anyone about you, and I won't.

371
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:53,657
If someone finds out, they'll only spoil it.

372
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,583
Please, promise me.

373
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,419
That we'll remain a secret.

374
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,255
Forever.

375
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,757
Yes.

376
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,718
It'll be our secret.

377
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,011
Forever.

378
00:34:57,814 --> 00:34:59,713
It was teary.

379
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:01,632
She came home crying!

380
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,144
Did Anna say something?

381
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,980
She called my daughter names!

382
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,982
Names?

383
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:11,829
And she pulled out a cutter, too.

384
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:13,769
The horror!

385
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,863
I doubt she'd...

386
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,991
No, you need to hear it from the girl herself.

387
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,868
Now bring her here.

388
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,996
Seems she's not home yet.

389
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,834
She's out of place, out and about this late!

390
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,004
You two should look into that!

391
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,007
Better keep an eye on her.

392
00:35:37,854 --> 00:35:38,501
Take this.

393
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:39,168
It's dark.

394
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,680
No, thank you.

395
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,686
What if something happens to one of the kids?

396
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,024
So what if she's a bit late!

397
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,692
Don't get so worked up.

398
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,028
She is not out of place.

399
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,031
Ah, she's home.

400
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,200
Anna.

401
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,369
Aunt Oiwa...

402
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:04,172
Were you listening?

403
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:05,819
Don't you worry.

404
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,542
You two will get along just fine.

405
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,879
Now take a bath and have dinner.

406
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:13,880
Thank you.

407
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:17,050
Or is it dinner before the bath?

408
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,219
It hardly matters.

409
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,722
But names is a bit harsh.

410
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,725
That's for sure.

411
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,560
It's not that funny.

412
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:48,081
Auntie, inquiring like always.

413
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:53,555
Anna!

414
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:54,785
Watermelon!

415
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,720
Anna?

416
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,726
Two hours until high tide...

417
00:37:52,113 --> 00:37:53,115
Hop in.

418
00:37:53,135 --> 00:37:54,137
Time for a picnic.

419
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,608
I brought juice and cookies.

420
00:37:57,118 --> 00:37:58,433
Picnic?

421
00:37:58,453 --> 00:37:59,768
At this hour?

422
00:37:59,954 --> 00:38:01,353
That's right.

423
00:38:01,373 --> 00:38:02,772
Let's go across the marsh.

424
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,545
You're very good at rowing.

425
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,508
You need rowing lessons.

426
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,884
Come here.

427
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,973
It's easy.

428
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:41,194
Remember I said last night that you're my precious secret?

429
00:38:43,164 --> 00:38:44,834
I remember.

430
00:38:44,854 --> 00:38:46,524
And you're my secret.

431
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,326
I'm glad.

432
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,204
Hey!

433
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,003
Good, you're doing well.

434
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:06,386
But I don't even know your name yet.

435
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,558
I hadn't told you?

436
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,601
Marnie.

437
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,854
I thought you already knew.

438
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,190
That's dangerous.

439
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,493
Go ahead, just row.

440
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,889
There's so much I want to know about you.

441
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,058
But I want to find out slowly.

442
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,562
Slowly, by myself, as we go along.

443
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,063
Okay.

444
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,733
I'll tell you what we'll do.

445
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:06,946
We'll ask each other three questions a night.

446
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:07,947
Great.

447
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,575
All right, I'll start.

448
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:14,579
Question one: Why are you here in this village?

449
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,498
I have asthma.

450
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:22,587
The doctor said I should go somewhere with clean air for a while.

451
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,131
Even by skipping school.

452
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,758
Oh no, you're ill?

453
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,635
If there's no attack, I'm fine.

454
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,264
So I'm staying here with Auntie's relatives, the Oiwas.

455
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:34,641
Who's Auntie?

456
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,643
It's my turn to ask now.

457
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,520
Do you live in that mansion?

458
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,231
Ever since I was two.

459
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,442
With Nan and the maids.

460
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,444
It's juice.

461
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,447
Where are your parents?

462
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,210
They only come here sometimes.

463
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,107
They're busy with work.

464
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,453
I see.

465
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,623
Question two: Who's Auntie?

466
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,542
My guardian.

467
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:07,465
But I was a worry to her, so she sent me here for a while.

468
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,008
What do you mean?

469
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,302
I'll explain that some other time.

470
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,513
It's my turn now.

471
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:15,848
Do you have siblings?

472
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,475
I'm an only child.

473
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,310
I see, you too...

474
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,520
How come?

475
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,690
Oh, it's nothing.

476
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,652
Just curious what it's like to have siblings.

477
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,656
I know, it'd be fun to imagine that.

478
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,700
All right, question three.

479
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,869
What's it like living at the Oiwas?

480
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,705
At the Oiwas?

481
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,084
Huh...

482
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,503
How strange...

483
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,839
I can't...

484
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,174
remember...

485
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,962
Marnie?

486
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:32,717
Marnie!

487
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:33,968
Anna!

488
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:38,254
There you are.

489
00:42:38,274 --> 00:42:40,089
I wondered where you went.

490
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,437
Marnie?

491
00:42:49,744 --> 00:42:51,684
I looked all over for you.

492
00:42:51,704 --> 00:42:53,644
You just disappeared.

493
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,907
I didn't go anywhere.

494
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,618
I was just trying to answer your question.

495
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,995
Wait...

496
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,081
What was it?

497
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,250
It's okay, it doesn't matter.

498
00:43:06,427 --> 00:43:07,575
I need to go soon.

499
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:08,743
Today is...

500
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,049
Oh, I know!

501
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:16,960
No no no, I really can't!

502
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,171
Parties aren't really my...

503
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,598
Don't worry.

504
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,601
I have a great idea.

505
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,304
It's true.

506
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,098
That's hard to believe.

507
00:44:14,829 --> 00:44:16,895
Sorry, did you wait long?

508
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:18,981
I had trouble getting away.

509
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,825
Marnie.

510
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:23,327
What do you think?

511
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,830
It's pretty.

512
00:44:26,674 --> 00:44:28,677
I borrowed Nan's shawl.

513
00:44:28,697 --> 00:44:30,700
I'll be scolded again.

514
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,545
This won't work.

515
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,506
Don't worry, I spoke to Father.

516
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,347
Young lady...

517
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,351
I believe it is past your bedtime.

518
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,021
And who might this be?

519
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,567
She is wearing my shawl.

520
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,528
Upstairs!

521
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,364
Wait right there!

522
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:17,048
You must be up to no good again.

523
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,050
You go that way.

524
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,055
Marnie!

525
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,557
Why you little...

526
00:45:37,578 --> 00:45:38,935
Marnie!

527
00:45:38,955 --> 00:45:40,312
Open it!

528
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,280
Let's go.

529
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:45,910
If you keep this up, you'll grow up to be childish always!

530
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,879
Everyone, we have a lovely flower girl here.

531
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,257
A guest of my daughter.

532
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,800
Ah, a flower girl.

533
00:46:01,102 --> 00:46:02,750
There's Marnie.

534
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,418
She'll be pretty like her mother.

535
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,974
May I please have one of those flowers?

536
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,601
My mother.

537
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,946
Hello, dear little witch.

538
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,950
That woman there's the real witch.

539
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,713
I want only one, for good luck.

540
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:43,301
Will someone kindly pay for my flower?

541
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,306
If it is the witch's command...

542
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:50,683
Then I'll have one, too.

543
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:52,383
Here.

544
00:46:52,403 --> 00:46:53,467
For superb luck.

545
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,816
Ah, it's begun.

546
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,156
I'm sorry!

547
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,365
Oh, she ran away.

548
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:25,217
Come take one for luck!

549
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:42,902
Young lady.

550
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,363
To your health.

551
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:49,033
Thank you.

552
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,221
Wine?

553
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,484
Awake now?

554
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,113
I...

555
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,907
Are you okay?

556
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:34,912
Who was that?

557
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,455
Which one?

558
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,124
The one dancing with you.

559
00:48:39,093 --> 00:48:40,678
You mean Kazuhiko?

560
00:48:40,698 --> 00:48:42,283
An old friend.

561
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,756
He's a good dancer.

562
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,008
So are you.

563
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,974
Now let's dance, you and I.

564
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,105
I can't dance.

565
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,107
Just follow my lead.

566
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,500
Look for me again.

567
00:50:03,886 --> 00:50:05,513
And don't tell anyone.

568
00:50:05,533 --> 00:50:07,160
Promise.

569
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,214
I know.

570
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,552
Hey, wait...

571
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,031
Is that...?

572
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,080
It's the girl with the Oiwas.

573
00:51:11,245 --> 00:51:12,727
I see.

574
00:51:12,747 --> 00:51:14,229
Hope you find the other shoe.

575
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,907
It must be somewhere.

576
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,909
I'll go look.

577
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,287
Used to always lose mine.

578
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:25,082
There's a bunch buried in the mud flats.

579
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,084
Don't compare her to you.

580
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:30,421
I should have my daughter's old shoes.

581
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,298
I'll get them out.

582
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,425
Thank you.

583
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,944
Marnie...

584
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,481
Wow.

585
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,861
Not only are they big, they're delicious, too.

586
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,713
You're good with the knife.

587
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,466
Auntie teaches me all the time.

588
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,553
You're so polite and well-behaved.

589
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,348
My daughter could learn from you.

590
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,184
Passing behind you.

591
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,605
I remember when you first came to Yoriko's place.

592
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,191
She was ecstatic.

593
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:21,198
She wanted to make up for the five years she didn't have with you.

594
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:26,912
So she taught you things, like knife skills.

595
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,377
But she worries too much.

596
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,047
Always calling me for help.

597
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,551
When I told her I was busy, she started complaining.

598
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,262
Oh, I shouldn't share this about your mother.

599
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,557
No, I understand.

600
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:51,270
You know, Yoriko sent us tons of photos of you.

601
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,605
I'll show you later.

602
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,235
Hey, look.

603
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:02,281
Found the wind chime I made on our honeymoon.

604
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,909
To survive the summer.

605
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,414
Your hair's getting long.

606
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,958
Shall I give you a haircut?

607
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,252
That would be a disaster.

608
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,448
Mar...nie...?

609
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,992
Look for me again.

610
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,502
How could I nearly forget about Marnie?

611
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:14,478
Marnie...

612
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,526
Marnie!

613
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,491
Marnie...

614
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,905
May I?

615
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,033
Sure.

616
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,953
I see you draw, too.

617
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:16,373
That girl looks like someone I knew.

618
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,250
She was a great girl.

619
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,920
Yes, she is.

620
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,966
But I haven't seen her in a week.

621
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:31,221
I wonder if she's upset that I forgot.

622
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,893
If she's a friend, talk to her and you'll be fine.

623
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:39,730
Say, will you take a look?

624
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,231
Sure.

625
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,117
Are the colors too messy?

626
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,411
No, it's wonderful.

627
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,455
I'm Hisako.

628
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,489
I'm in love with 'The Marsh House'.

629
00:56:58,509 --> 00:57:00,408
What about you?

630
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,014
I'm Anna.

631
00:57:03,034 --> 00:57:04,328
I love it, too.

632
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,431
Better hurry and finish your drawing...

633
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,934
before the new folks move in.

634
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,269
The renovations are under way.

635
00:57:23,116 --> 00:57:24,681
Thanks for your hard work.

636
00:57:24,701 --> 00:57:26,266
Have some tea.

637
00:57:26,453 --> 00:57:27,768
Oh, thank you.

638
00:57:27,788 --> 00:57:29,103
Appreciate it.

639
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,491
Hey, let's take a break!

640
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,451
All right, coming.

641
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,131
Are you Marnie?

642
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,222
Come.

643
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,322
I hadn't seen the front before.

644
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,575
It's a lot cleaner now, but not done yet.

645
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:19,246
Hello.

646
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,706
Hey there.

647
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,833
Brought a friend, huh?

648
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,169
Never mind the flip-flops.

649
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,046
A Quest?

650
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,214
Yeah, a secret one.

651
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:30,716
Secret?

652
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,342
Hey!

653
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:35,178
Sorry, make yourself at home.

654
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,181
Thank you.

655
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,022
Yes, it's a lovely place.

656
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:48,567
Yes, we're still in the middle of renovation.

657
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,527
This room...

658
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,032
Upstairs.

659
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,785
This hasn't been renovated yet.

660
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,042
Here, this is my room.

661
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,087
Really...

662
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:14,718
What do you think?

663
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,429
It's a cute room.

664
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,725
It used to be your room, right?

665
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,394
You're...

666
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,563
Marnie, right?

667
00:59:27,074 --> 00:59:28,472
Me?

668
00:59:28,492 --> 00:59:29,890
No, no!

669
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,779
But...then why have you been staring at my room?

670
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:34,654
Because...

671
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,908
See, that's where I always see you.

672
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,827
I've seen you many times.

673
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:43,914
No, no.

674
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,250
I just love this mansion, that's all.

675
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,543
That can't be.

676
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,923
When I said Marnie earlier, you were surprised.

677
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,009
Rather, why do you know Marnie?

678
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,808
I found it behind the shelf.

679
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,769
A diary?

680
01:00:05,904 --> 01:00:07,156
That's right.

681
01:00:07,176 --> 01:00:08,428
Your diary.

682
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,614
Marnie!

683
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:23,161
I'll pour you some Queen Mary, your favorite.

684
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,539
I'll be back.

685
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,172
'Last night I went for a row in my nightie.

686
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:41,888
The marsh and the moon were very pretty at night' I shall do it again.

687
01:00:44,609 --> 01:00:45,944
June 8th.

688
01:00:45,964 --> 01:00:47,299
A party!

689
01:00:48,196 --> 01:00:50,658
Father, Mother and many of their friends came.

690
01:00:50,678 --> 01:00:53,140
It was such fun.

691
01:00:55,026 --> 01:01:01,032
I went outside from the sunroom and danced with a flower girl.

692
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,411
But...

693
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:09,666
Nan locked me in my room because of last night.

694
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:14,880
So there won't be any midnight rows for a bit.

695
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:25,182
See, it's you, isn't it?

696
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,685
No.

697
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:30,729
Marnie is...

698
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,856
Marnie is...

699
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:36,568
someone I made up.

700
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:41,364
An imaginary girl, only in my mind.

701
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,577
But this is Marnie's diary.

702
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,873
It's as if she really lived here.

703
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,920
So you're not Marnie?

704
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:55,879
No.

705
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,881
She's just imaginary?

706
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,090
That's right.

707
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:05,263
I thought you were Marnie, back for her diary...

708
01:02:09,402 --> 01:02:11,051
I'm Anna.

709
01:02:11,071 --> 01:02:12,720
I came from Sapporo to get better.

710
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:15,315
I'm Sayaka.

711
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,109
I'm from Tokyo.

712
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:24,074
But if she was imaginary, why is her name the same?

713
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:26,493
I don't know.

714
01:02:26,962 --> 01:02:29,194
Marnie must be real.

715
01:02:29,214 --> 01:02:31,446
I'm going to investigate.

716
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,764
Say, Marnie...

717
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:52,310
Who are you?

718
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,292
Is that me?

719
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,718
Marnie?

720
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,469
Marnie!

721
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:42,277
Wait, that one's not done yet...

722
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,280
Wow, you draw well.

723
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,157
Oh, thanks...

724
01:03:47,334 --> 01:03:49,650
I've never had anyone draw me before.

725
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:51,986
How nice!

726
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,921
I missed you.

727
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,344
I kept calling you in my heart.

728
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:12,807
Me, too.

729
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,184
Let's go.

730
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,560
Come to my room.

731
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:19,564
Come to my room, Marnie.

732
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,737
I can't go far from the mansion.

733
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:32,077
Okay then, we'll go wherever you want.

734
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,817
You know a lot about mushrooms.

735
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:07,737
Father taught me when I was little.

736
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:11,574
I once brought home three bags full of mushrooms.

737
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,412
The look on Mother's face!

738
01:05:24,139 --> 01:05:25,766
What's wrong?

739
01:05:25,786 --> 01:05:27,413
So quiet all of a sudden.

740
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,594
You're very lucky.

741
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,931
I wish I was you.

742
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,067
Talk to me.

743
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,447
I'm...

744
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:53,867
a foster child.

745
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:59,664
My real parents died when I was little.

746
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,791
My grandmother, too.

747
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:06,045
I know they didn't die on purpose, but...

748
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,548
sometimes I feel like...

749
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:11,301
I can't forgive them...

750
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,345
for leaving me all alone.

751
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:20,810
I'm jealous of you.

752
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,646
You're lucky to be a single child.

753
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:33,865
If you had no relatives, then the folks who took you in as a daughter must be truly kindhearted people.

754
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,670
Then I'll tell you a big secret.

755
01:06:49,057 --> 01:06:51,810
It's about my parents.

756
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:54,583
They're good to me and they're kind.

757
01:06:55,553 --> 01:07:00,433
I'm not their real child, yet they raised me, which I appreciate.

758
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:05,522
But you see, I saw it one day.

759
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:09,067
They're paid for it.

760
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,694
Money?

761
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,614
I found a letter from the government.

762
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:20,870
It said they were increasing the subsidy for me.

763
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,457
I'm sure there's a reason...

764
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,417
I don't care!

765
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:33,007
They wouldn't get it if I were their real child.

766
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:38,388
They get paid because I'm not their real child.

767
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:46,104
Even worse... they hide it from me.

768
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,232
I see.

769
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,654
But that doesn't mean Auntie doesn't love you.

770
01:07:54,956 --> 01:07:56,166
No!

771
01:07:56,186 --> 01:07:57,396
Don't you see?

772
01:07:57,584 --> 01:07:59,607
None of the other families receive money.

773
01:07:59,627 --> 01:08:01,650
Just us!

774
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:07,250
She always looks worried that I might find out.

775
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:11,296
And I hate myself for thinking like this.

776
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:15,174
I...just can't... believe...

777
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,427
in anything anymore.

778
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:30,273
Anna, it's okay to cry.

779
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,442
Just know that I love you.

780
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:38,823
I love you more than any girl I've ever known.

781
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,662
Then you tell me your secret next.

782
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:52,128
It was long ago that I went mushrooming with Father.

783
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:56,507
Nowadays, I hardly see my parents.

784
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,219
Mother's usually travelling.

785
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:08,811
Because of work, Father's home only twice a year.

786
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:14,651
Usually, Nan and the twin maids are the only ones home.

787
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,986
And me.

788
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:21,157
I slip out while they're gossiping.

789
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:25,578
And look how free I get to be!

790
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:32,168
It's lovely when my parents come home.

791
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,504
They host parties!

792
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,548
Like the other day.

793
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:44,764
With my amazing parents and many people there, it's delightful.

794
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:49,060
I get to wear new dresses and dance, too.

795
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:55,733
That's when I'm sure I'm the luckiest girl in the world.

796
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,444
I see.

797
01:10:08,715 --> 01:10:11,009
Tell me, Anna.

798
01:10:11,029 --> 01:10:13,323
Will you be my friend forever?

799
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:14,919
Yes.

800
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,879
I'm your friend forever.

801
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:18,797
Right?

802
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:19,757
Right?

803
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,555
Nan's always in a bad mood.

804
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:30,393
She yanks me by the arm, brushes my hair very hard...

805
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,563
No one thinks I'm being bullied.

806
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,065
But it really hurts.

807
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,234
Enough to cry.

808
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:43,281
The maids love to frighten me.

809
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,951
They threatened me all the time.

810
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:53,708
'Naughty kids get shut in the silo where ghosts suck out their souls' they said.

811
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,587
You mean, the silo on the hill?

812
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,090
Once, they actually took me there.

813
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:02,842
No!

814
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,970
They dragged me all the way to the silo.

815
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,139
I thought I'd die of fright.

816
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:14,604
Then suddenly, just as we got there, the sky went dark and the thunder came.

817
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:21,152
The maids were terrified, so we didn't go inside.

818
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:25,740
I can endure anything else.

819
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,619
Anything but the silo.

820
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:33,289
I never heard such a terrible thing!

821
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:36,667
I hope the maids and Nan get struck by lightning!

822
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:42,757
Hasn't anyone ever tried to frighten you?

823
01:11:43,351 --> 01:11:44,749
Never.

824
01:11:44,769 --> 01:11:46,167
Definitely not on purpose.

825
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,680
You're lucky.

826
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:53,059
I wish I was you.

827
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,188
Our castle...

828
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:01,984
Poor Marnie.

829
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:05,071
I love you the most, too.

830
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,490
More than anyone I've known.

831
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,244
Thank you.

832
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:20,711
Funny, it's like we traded places.

833
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,005
How true.

834
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:31,931
The tide's coming in.

835
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:36,185
Hey, let's go to the silo together.

836
01:12:37,697 --> 01:12:39,512
The ghosts must be a lie.

837
01:12:39,532 --> 01:12:41,347
Let's go make sure.

838
01:12:42,493 --> 01:12:44,079
Tomorrow...

839
01:12:44,099 --> 01:12:45,685
No, let's go right now.

840
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:55,329
I don't care who Marnie really is.

841
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:59,792
I just want to help her.

842
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:13,431
Are you okay, Marnie?

843
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:17,977
Yes, I'm sure I'll be all right if I'm with you...

844
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:19,729
Kazuhiko.

845
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,282
Anna!

846
01:13:32,084 --> 01:13:33,586
Perfect timing!

847
01:13:33,606 --> 01:13:35,108
I found it!

848
01:13:45,139 --> 01:13:46,641
The rest of the diary.

849
01:13:46,661 --> 01:13:48,163
Come to my place.

850
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,967
Marnie...

851
01:13:51,354 --> 01:13:52,710
I'm sorry.

852
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:54,086
Another time.

853
01:13:54,607 --> 01:13:55,880
What?

854
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,173
But it's a major discovery...

855
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,770
It's going to rain!

856
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,033
Who is it?

857
01:14:58,452 --> 01:14:59,870
Is someone there?

858
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:01,539
Marnie!

859
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,535
So you did go ahead.

860
01:15:07,555 --> 01:15:09,370
Don't scare me like that.

861
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:13,342
Marnie.

862
01:15:17,481 --> 01:15:18,421
Are you okay?

863
01:15:18,441 --> 01:15:19,381
Why did you...

864
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:20,516
Kazuhiko!

865
01:15:21,736 --> 01:15:23,384
I'm frightened.

866
01:15:23,404 --> 01:15:25,052
I heard somebody below.

867
01:15:25,906 --> 01:15:27,430
I thought I'd die of fright.

868
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:28,974
Kazuhiko...

869
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:31,308
What're you saying?

870
01:15:31,328 --> 01:15:32,726
I'm Anna.

871
01:15:32,746 --> 01:15:34,144
Pull yourself together.

872
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,741
Anna...Anna!

873
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:39,744
I don't want to be humiliated.

874
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,412
But I haven't the courage.

875
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:42,747
Oh, Anna...

876
01:15:44,008 --> 01:15:45,365
You do have courage.

877
01:15:45,385 --> 01:15:46,742
You came here.

878
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:50,087
Let's go home.

879
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,436
Wait!

880
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:10,681
It's just the wind.

881
01:16:10,701 --> 01:16:11,932
Let's go.

882
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:14,612
We'll go home together.

883
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,050
Anna, come back here.

884
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:37,468
Anna!

885
01:16:38,354 --> 01:16:39,898
We made it up.

886
01:16:39,918 --> 01:16:41,462
I'm sure we can make it down.

887
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,809
I'll go first, so follow me.

888
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:49,480
No, don't leave me!

889
01:16:58,656 --> 01:16:59,490
No!

890
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,161
Marnie!

891
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:07,998
Let's go over there.

892
01:17:21,522 --> 01:17:22,753
I'm cold...

893
01:17:22,773 --> 01:17:24,004
So cold...

894
01:17:27,778 --> 01:17:29,885
Oh Anna, I'm scared...

895
01:17:29,905 --> 01:17:32,012
I'm scared...

896
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:35,693
Don't worry, we'll be fine if we're together.

897
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:39,029
You did well, Marnie.

898
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,072
Are you okay?

899
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,575
Kazuhiko!

900
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:27,453
I thought you'd never come.

901
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:30,748
I...I...

902
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:40,424
Let's go home.

903
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:06,450
Marnie?

904
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:10,788
Marnie!

905
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:20,464
Marnie!

906
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:30,891
Marnie...You left me behind!

907
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,650
Even you!

908
01:20:06,103 --> 01:20:07,355
Kazuhiko...

909
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:08,627
Kazuhiko...

910
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:11,849
Kazuhiko's all over this diary.

911
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:19,857
'Kazuhiko is trying to take me to the silo' Silo...

912
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:23,569
Yes?

913
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:26,822
Mom cooked some corn.

914
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,033
Hurry or it'll be gone.

915
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:29,950
Wait!

916
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:34,538
Why go out on a night like this?

917
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,206
It's not safe.

918
01:20:36,383 --> 01:20:38,865
My friend might be caught in the rain.

919
01:20:38,885 --> 01:20:41,367
What if she gets pneumonia?

920
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:46,717
Is that...

921
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,969
Anna!

922
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:50,554
Are you okay?

923
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,224
So cruel...

924
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,227
Anna?

925
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,981
So cruel, Marnie...

926
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:03,067
She has a high fever!

927
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:04,568
I'll go get help.

928
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:07,071
Anna.

929
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:11,408
Anna?

930
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:14,745
Anna...

931
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,586
How's she doing?

932
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:26,423
Her fever's not coming down.

933
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,427
She did get a shot earlier.

934
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:32,262
I see.

935
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:44,942
So cruel...

936
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:50,614
Marnie, how could you?

937
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:56,954
I won't forgive you.

938
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:00,457
Leaving me behind without a word.

939
01:22:25,701 --> 01:22:27,078
Anna!

940
01:22:27,098 --> 01:22:28,475
My dear Anna!

941
01:22:30,497 --> 01:22:32,479
Marnie!

942
01:22:32,499 --> 01:22:34,481
How could you leave me behind?

943
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:36,869
Why did you betray me?

944
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:40,873
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to leave you all alone.

945
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:42,833
But...

946
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:48,505
But at that moment, you weren't there.

947
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,133
What do you mean?

948
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:54,344
Oh, Anna, I...

949
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:57,681
I can't stay here any longer.

950
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:01,185
I have to say goodbye to you.

951
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:06,356
So please, Anna, please say you forgive me!

952
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:12,196
Anna...

953
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,701
Of course, I forgive you!

954
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:20,537
I'll miss you, Marnie!

955
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:23,165
And I won't forget you!

956
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:24,885
I'll never forget you!

957
01:23:24,905 --> 01:23:26,240
Ever!

958
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,253
Anna.

959
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,011
Sayaka's here for you.

960
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:22,516
Thanks.

961
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,938
You could see her in your room.

962
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:30,440
No, it's nice outside.

963
01:24:30,784 --> 01:24:32,377
The view here is beautiful.

964
01:24:32,397 --> 01:24:33,990
I'd love to show you.

965
01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:35,603
Anna Sayaka.

966
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:38,115
Here, a get-well gift.

967
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:39,616
Thanks.

968
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:40,784
Also...

969
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:47,791
This is what made me think you might be at the silo.

970
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:48,959
What is it?

971
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:52,421
The rest of the diary you promised to read.

972
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,300
I'm having trouble remembering.

973
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:58,176
I impressed myself.

974
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:02,472
I found a clue in this painting that was behind the cupboard.

975
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,976
Maybe I'm psychic.

976
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:08,145
Turn it over.

977
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:15,485
Hisako!

978
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:20,657
Hisako!

979
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:39,176
Please, will you tell us about Marnie?

980
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:40,927
But...

981
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:43,680
it's a rather sad story.

982
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:46,016
I'm ready for it.

983
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:53,523
It was a long time ago.

984
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:58,862
I used to play at 'The Marsh House' often.

985
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:03,200
Marnie and I were very little.

986
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:04,534
It's a bear!

987
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,036
Let me see.

988
01:26:06,505 --> 01:26:08,007
This is Daddy.

989
01:26:08,027 --> 01:26:09,529
Isn't he dashing?

990
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:16,046
Marnie loved to boast about her glamorous parents and their extravagant parties.

991
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:22,719
But the truth is, she could have been cared for more.

992
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,558
Goodbye, Marnie.

993
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,185
That dear child...

994
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,845
No, don't leave me, Mommy!

995
01:26:32,865 --> 01:26:35,390
Don't go!

996
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:38,568
Seems the maids didn't  look after her very well.

997
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:40,570
That's not right!

998
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:47,577
Later, Marnie moved to Sapporo and married Kazuhiko, her childhood friend.

999
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:54,376
With her family apart and feeling lost...

1000
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:57,087
he was there to support her.

1001
01:26:58,682 --> 01:27:00,705
I'm glad.

1002
01:27:00,725 --> 01:27:02,748
So Kazuhiko was a good man.

1003
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:07,597
Two years later, Emily was born.

1004
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:13,937
At last in the warm household she'd always wanted, Marnie was happy.

1005
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:20,110
I didn't see Marnie for many years after that.

1006
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:22,946
The next time was...

1007
01:27:23,196 --> 01:27:27,284
a few years after Kazuhiko had passed on of an illness.

1008
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:37,461
By then, Marnie was in mourning due to the shock.

1009
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,296
Mourning?

1010
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,424
A place where you go to get better.

1011
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,969
What happened to Emily?

1012
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:51,641
Marnie's parents had passed on, leaving no one to look after her.

1013
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:58,982
So for elementary school, she was sent to a boarding school.

1014
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:12,496
By the time she returned at age 73, she'd become a different person.

1015
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:14,331
Emily!

1016
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:17,167
She was willful and independent.

1017
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:24,174
She knew Marnie was ill, but still resented her for sending her away.

1018
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:28,220
You think that makes you more motherly?

1019
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:31,973
I want you to live the way you wish, but...

1020
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:33,517
you need to...

1021
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:36,853
They never did make up after that.

1022
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:37,979
As your mother...

1023
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:41,024
I've never thought of you as a mother.

1024
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:46,363
Emily ran away and soon got married.

1025
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:49,699
She was expecting, you see.

1026
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,388
But...

1027
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:19,229
One day, Emily and her husband got into a car accident.

1028
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:25,151
I heard Marnie took their child in.

1029
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:32,409
She was determined to never let this child be lonely.

1030
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:35,078
But...

1031
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:39,207
she never got over losing Emily.

1032
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:44,921
She became very ill, and passed on the next year.

1033
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:50,260
That was about ten years ago.

1034
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,435
I'm sorry, it's a sad story.

1035
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:01,271
No, thank you very much.

1036
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:05,942
Marnie adored that mansion.

1037
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:11,948
She loved seeing the marsh from her window.

1038
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:17,454
She said it felt like the birds spoke to her.

1039
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:24,461
She had a lonely life, but she lived it fully.

1040
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:28,965
Always with a smile, determined to be happy.

1041
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:33,929
So you've met Marnie, too.

1042
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:57,327
Wish we could've played more, Anna.

1043
01:30:57,661 --> 01:31:00,664
The plan was always just for the summer.

1044
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:03,500
Will you come again next summer?

1045
01:31:03,969 --> 01:31:05,137
I'm sure I will.

1046
01:31:05,157 --> 01:31:06,325
I'll write you.

1047
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:09,506
I'll write you, too.

1048
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:17,013
I put the diary and painting back where I found them.

1049
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:19,349
Good, it's for the best.

1050
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:21,851
I haven't told my family.

1051
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:24,521
Let's keep it our secret.

1052
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:28,858
How funny...

1053
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:33,571
Marnie brought us together.

1054
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:35,365
That's true.

1055
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:38,368
Marnie...

1056
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:46,209
The girl trapped behind the blue window...

1057
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,546
That was long ago.

1058
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:58,054
Exactly, he does it to save her life.

1059
01:31:58,221 --> 01:31:59,556
I love that part.

1060
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:02,726
Ah, now I want to read it all over again.

1061
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:05,228
I'll loan you Volume 2.

1062
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:06,730
Anna!

1063
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:11,901
Auntie!

1064
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:16,072
Anna...

1065
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:20,243
Hey, be careful!

1066
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:21,745
Sorry, sorry.

1067
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:30,587
Auntie's here.

1068
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:34,257
Ah, Yoriko, you're here.

1069
01:32:36,926 --> 01:32:38,762
Thank you for everything.

1070
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:42,265
She's doing well and even made a friend.

1071
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:44,601
How can I ever repay you?

1072
01:32:44,736 --> 01:32:46,656
Oh, no.

1073
01:32:46,676 --> 01:32:48,596
We didn't do anything at all.

1074
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:50,732
Anna is a good girl.

1075
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:54,110
It was like having our own daughter back.

1076
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:56,112
She's welcome anytime.

1077
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:57,947
Thank you.

1078
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,449
Let's talk inside.

1079
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:05,789
I'm impressed you didn't call us this time.

1080
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:20,970
I'm all packed.

1081
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:22,806
Anna.

1082
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:25,308
Yes?

1083
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:30,146
There's something I need to tell you.

1084
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:36,653
We receive monthly monies to cover your expenses.

1085
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:38,655
We receive money.

1086
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:42,283
I've long hesitated to tell you, but...

1087
01:33:42,418 --> 01:33:43,587
It's okay.

1088
01:33:43,607 --> 01:33:44,776
But believe me...

1089
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:49,916
Whether or not we receive monies, it doesn't change our love for you.

1090
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:52,669
I already knew.

1091
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:55,672
I'm happy you told me about it.

1092
01:33:55,839 --> 01:33:56,840
Anna!

1093
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:05,181
I've been looking at the photos you sent.

1094
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:07,350
Photos?

1095
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:14,190
Oh, while you were away I was looking at old albums and found this picture.

1096
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:15,692
Do you remember?

1097
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:20,029
It's that mansion.

1098
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:23,825
When you first came, you wouldn't let it go.

1099
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:31,374
I was told at the adoption it belonged to your grandmother.

1100
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:41,217
My beloved home Marnie Marnie!

1101
01:35:20,089 --> 01:35:22,258
So that's who she was.

1102
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:25,762
Anna.

1103
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:33,603
And so I was in the silo all night.

1104
01:35:33,937 --> 01:35:36,439
I was very frightened.

1105
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:39,776
That's when your grandpa came.

1106
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:43,613
He encouraged me, saying I did well.

1107
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:47,784
I've overcome many frightening things.

1108
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:49,786
And so will you, Anna.

1109
01:35:50,954 --> 01:35:56,960
After all, you're my one and only grandchild.

1110
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:00,964
Grandma...

1111
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:46,676
Excuse me.

1112
01:36:49,012 --> 01:36:50,013
Anna.

1113
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:53,516
I'm sorry for what I said.

1114
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:58,187
Don't skip trash pickup next year.

1115
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:06,696
A friend?

1116
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,031
Maybe.

1117
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:16,372
Hisako!

1118
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:21,210
Anna.

1119
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:24,213
I'm going home to Sapporo now.

1120
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:25,882
Is that right?

1121
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:30,053
But your face tells me something good happened.
