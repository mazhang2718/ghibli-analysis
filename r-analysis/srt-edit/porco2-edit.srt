92
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,787
Engine stopped.

93
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:45,952

00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:45,518
We aren't gonna sink!.

109
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:46,832

121
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,768
Don't worry.

122
00:08:01,788 --> 00:08:03,566
We all belong to a swimming club.

123
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:04,208

Signal from the pig!

129
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,416

133
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:19,879
Half?

140
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:34,717
Don't shoot!

141
00:08:43,283 --> 00:08:45,015
Bye-bye!

142
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:46,767
Bye bye Pirates!

143
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,403
See that went well!

144
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,781
He was nice enough not to kill us.

145
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:52,251
Show more ambition!

146
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:53,565
You are a pirate!

147
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:00,970
Cmon on!

148
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,744
Get me!

149
00:09:01,764 --> 00:09:02,518
Hey!

150
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:03,292
Get outta here!

151
00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:05,452
Hey!

152
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:06,120
Don't touch that!

153
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,788
Hey!

154
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:07,456
Get down from there!

155
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:09,768
Put your pulls back on!

156
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:11,959
Hey!

157
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:13,086
Get down!

158
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,642
Hey...don't touch that.

159
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:26,920
Another triumph for Porco Rosso!  It's a good thing, we pirate abandoned... together right?  We gotta do somethin' about that stupid Pig!

160
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:30,453
So you are an American who can help us?

161
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,395
The pirates of the Adriatic, can't have an American protection!

162
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:35,847
That's embarassing!

163
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,180
No its not!

164
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,513
Look at him, his grandma's cousin  was Italian.

165
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:40,489
And besides Curtis is the only pilot who can beat Porco.

166
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:42,289
And for 10% ...

167
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,924
10% ?

168
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:45,358
I'm not gonna pay that!

169
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:46,792
Shhh!

170
00:09:48,500 --> 00:10:10,197
(Singing in French) Beautiful.

171
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,402
Pig's here.

172
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,152
With his snout in the air as always.

173
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:35,374
Shh!

174
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:49,173
Mr.

175
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:49,731
Porco Rosso?

176
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,289
Congratulations on defeating...

177
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,092
the Mama Aiuto gang!

178
00:11:52,216 --> 00:11:56,097
Did you know you took twice the reward of Bounty Hunter this year?

179
00:11:56,197 --> 00:12:00,000
And Sir, how does it feel to be the top Bounty Hunter of the Adriatic?

180
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,342
And let me ask...Hey, eh!

181
00:12:02,362 --> 00:12:04,464
What do you think you doing?

182
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:06,474
Get your hands off me!

183
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:08,013
Shutup and listen to the song!

184
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:09,060
Yes Sir..

185
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,956
She sure is incredible.

186
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,774
I just might have to take her back home with me.

187
00:12:22,794 --> 00:12:25,152
I bet she can make it big in America.

188
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,041
Although she'll have to stop singing in front of each everytime!

189
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:30,490
Hey Cowboy!

190
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,491
Is that your plane upfront?

191
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:33,764
Yep.

192
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:35,704
I don't mind saying she made me bit of a celebrity in the racing world.

193
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:40,139
So you are the one who beat the Italians in the Schneider Cup?

194
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:41,815
That's right!

195
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:43,339
But what I'm best at is Aerial combat.

196
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,481
These pirates tell me that you got a pretty good reputation in the skies.

197
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,984
I'd be careful if you're planning on  making a deal with that Pirate Gangs.

198
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:56,698
Not only are they lying cheapstakes, not a single one of them knows how to bathe.

199
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,032
That's for sure.

200
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:00,441
Wait!

201
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:01,613
We heard that you stupid pig.

202
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:02,942
Hello.Look at this?

203
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:04,155
While you handsome pirate bosses are...

204
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:08,545
in one table, you are not here  to cause problems are you?

205
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,425
You know my rule,you eat in my restaraunt..not fight.

206
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:15,060
Ofcourse, Gina.

207
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,421
We would never fight within 50 miles from your place.

208
00:13:17,557 --> 00:13:18,874
We're even getting along with the pig.

209
00:13:18,894 --> 00:13:20,211
Aren't we?

210
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,016
Be good boys.

211
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,521
Wish me luck.

212
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,400
May I help you?

213
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,909
Porco, tell me about your rescue?

214
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,910
Next time just the two of us.

215
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,164
Eating all alone here again.

216
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:53,729
So what do you think about the American flyboy?

217
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,203
He's something else, isn't he?

218
00:13:55,388 --> 00:14:00,019
As soon as he saw me, he asked me to marry him!

219
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,007
So I told him of the three pilots I've married.

220
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:07,237
The first died in the war,second died in  the Atlantic, last one he died in Asia.

221
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:10,538
So you heard something?

222
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:16,715
I got the call last night.They found  his remains in some remote part of Bengal.

223
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,656
It's strange Marco.

224
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:22,475
I've been waiting to hear something for 3 years...

225
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,177
but now I can't even cry.

226
00:14:24,258 --> 00:14:26,077
Just feel numb.

227
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,177
Maybe I've run out of tears.

228
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:30,905
Well yeah!

229
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:32,385
The good guys always die.

230
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,865
Cheers.

231
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:35,345
To a good man.

232
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,965
Marco I wanna thank you for keeping an eye on me.

233
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,265
And my restaraunt all these years.

234
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,975
I can't tell you how much your friendship means to me.

235
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,125
Well you know, its a great place...

236
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,477
except from that ugly photograph you keep hanging in the wall up there.

237
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:56,193
Hey!

238
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:57,701
That's my favorite picture.

239
00:14:57,721 --> 00:14:59,209
I can't  believe you scribbled over your face!

240
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:02,818
That's the only picture left of you as a human.

241
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,370
How you ever going to break that stupid curse on you,Marco?

242
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:11,808
Face it!

243
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,808
I'm a pig.

244
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,061
That American's gonna be trouble.

245
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:47,708
Hey, that's Porco Rosso.

246
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:49,208
Let's alert the captain.

247
00:16:00,553 --> 00:16:02,581
I envy you Mr.Rosso.

248
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,629
I wish I could make money way you do!

249
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,766
Here's this month's payment.

250
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,302
That the last you owe on the seaplane.

251
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:14,604
Let's see..How about buying some patriotic  bonds to help serve our nation?

252
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:16,218
Sorry I'm a pig.

253
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:17,555
Leave that to you humans.

254
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:35,737
Hey there,Mr.Rosso.

255
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:36,990
We got your gun ready.

256
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,810
Give me some ammo too,kid.

257
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,309
Yes Sir.

258
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,465
Lotta commotion in the street.

259
00:16:43,846 --> 00:16:46,016
Sure is!

260
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:48,206
Looks like our irons are in for change in government.

261
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,764
If so you Bounty Hunters will soon be outlaws.

262
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,600
Laws don't mean anything to a pig.

263
00:16:55,274 --> 00:16:56,488
That's a good point.

264
00:16:56,508 --> 00:16:57,722
Won't mean much to us weapons dealer either.

265
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,938
Here are the bullets!

266
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,366
You  sure you want the usual?  We got the new armor piercing that explode on contact!

267
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:06,424
Hey!

268
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:07,317
Easy kid.

269
00:17:07,337 --> 00:17:08,210
I'm just a bounty hunter.

270
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,103
I'm not fighting a war.

271
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:11,278
Come again.

272
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,044
So whats the difference between fighting a war and bounty hunting?

273
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,289
If you make money from war, you are scud...

274
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,589
but if you can't make money from bounty hunting you are an idiot!

275
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:26,996
Ah!

276
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:28,583
How in the whole world could we be in debt.This is ridiculous!

277
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,091
We miscalculated!

278
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:35,127
We didn't take quite enough money to cover our repairs!

279
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,861
Ah there!

280
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:36,502
The pirates are here!

281
00:17:41,737 --> 00:17:43,080
Man!

282
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,443
This is embarassing.

283
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,806
I can't believe we have to work with these losers!

284
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,117
It's the stupid pig's fault boss!

285
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:50,147
Look at that.

286
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:51,820
Those Mamma Aiutos guy can't even afford paint?

287
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,831
Its embarassing to be seen with them.

288
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,834
Alright I guess we're all here.

289
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,905
Hey, you in the back.

290
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:00,327
What  happened to Mr.America?

291
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,631
He's flying in the sun.

292
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,671
Typical American!

293
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,892
Sighted target: The Queen of the  Mediterranean at 10 'o' Clock.

294
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,352
That ship's kinda big, isn't?

295
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:21,113
That's why we doing this as a group.

296
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,637
Don't be such a sissy.

297
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:24,442
We're having engine trouble.

298
00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:25,709
You go on ahead.

299
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,976
We'll back you up.

300
00:18:27,158 --> 00:18:28,640
Don't try to chicken out!

301
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,142
We stick to the plan.

302
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,249
We share the cost of repairs, if one of us gets hit.

303
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:33,648
Right?

304
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:36,109
No you babies!

305
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:38,157
Everyones responsible  for his own expenses.

306
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:40,292
Even for the ammo?

307
00:18:40,312 --> 00:18:40,975
What do you think?

308
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:41,658
We're having engine trouble!

309
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,007
We're having engine trouble!

310
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:48,265
Shut up you sissies!

311
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:49,664
What guns are firing?

312
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,667
Attention all passengers!

313
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:57,294
We are now being attacked by seapirates.

314
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:01,353
Please do not be alarmed.

315
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,274
The Queen of the Mediterranean coastline has anticipated this possibility.

316
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,190
And equipped our ship with  two top of the lines pilots!

317
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,492
Now launching from the main desk, Lane#1 The Black Stallion, Sinor Valleta.

318
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,877
And from Lane#2 The Wolf of the Tiber, captain Visconti.

319
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:24,277
Go get 'em boys!

320
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,513
I didn't know they had security.

321
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:44,031
Aw, they are panicking.

322
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:45,265
I've to win this thing myself!

323
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:46,761
Get off me!

324
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:48,098
Help Curtiss!

325
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,694
Make ways, the American!

326
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,925
Hmm..alright I give up.

327
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,759
Guess I'll have to take this  baby to Milan for repairs.

328
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:30,613
With the help of American Donald Curtiss,airpirates shotdown Queen of the Mediterrean 2 security planes   after stealing all the valuables from the  ship,the pirates left the following message..

329
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,652
we're coming for ya!

330
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,447
Porco Rosso!

331
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,452
Repeat...

332
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:38,800
we're coming for you Porco Rosso!

333
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,623
Alright Ark!

334
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:40,446
Get off me!

335
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,998
You really expect me to wait here?

336
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:55,505
Forget it!

337
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:59,921
I'm off to Milan Lucious feet, soft bed, beautiful women.

338
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:15,485
There we go Cmon baby.

339
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:26,949
Just tour onto Milan I don't like this weather.

340
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:38,413
I better duck below the clouds.

341
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,772
Cmon, girl, cmon on!

342
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:40,838
That's it.

343
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:41,661
That's right!

344
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:42,484
Just stay with me baby!

345
00:22:54,216 --> 00:22:55,055
Porco!

346
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:55,914
What?

347
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:05,253
Fight me pig!

348
00:23:05,273 --> 00:23:06,300
One on one!

349
00:23:06,478 --> 00:23:07,379
No thanks Tex!

350
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:08,300
Kinda busy.

351
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,990
If you run away, I'll tell everyone you are chicken!

352
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,485
Chicken,pig... what's the difference?

353
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:26,166
Wo!

354
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:27,105
I'm out in the open.

355
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:30,465
Oh!

356
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:30,948
Cmon baby!

357
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:32,995
I hit the pig!

358
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:34,656
You didn't hit anything.

359
00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:35,993
My engine died you idiot.

360
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:48,948
He's down!

361
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:50,397
I'm a bonafide celebrity.

362
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:51,846
Yahoo!

363
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:11,380
I need some evidence or no one will believe me.

364
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,906
Let's see..

365
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,752
Gotcha!

366
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:40,660
Obnoxious red paint!

367
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,019
That's proof.

368
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,406
I might just take it back to Texas as a gift for mom.

369
00:25:30,622 --> 00:25:32,238
Hurry, its an emergency!

370
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:33,874
Marco's been shot down!

371
00:25:37,296 --> 00:25:39,061
Wait Ms.Gina!

372
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:40,846
There's a phone call for you.

373
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,679
Porco's alive.

374
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:44,078
He's on the phone right now.

375
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,047
You can take it at the front desk.

376
00:25:48,177 --> 00:25:49,097
Hey!

377
00:25:49,117 --> 00:25:50,037
Wait!

378
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,770
Marco?

379
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,120
Are you all right?

380
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,470
I was just about go search for you in my boat.

381
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:02,749
I'm fine!

382
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:03,489
A tugboat gave me a lift.

383
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:04,229
Aah!

384
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:05,652
Thank God!

385
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:06,960
And I've slimmed down.

386
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,268
On an island for two days.

387
00:26:08,786 --> 00:26:11,377
So you look pretty good!

388
00:26:11,397 --> 00:26:13,988
Though not sexy as that American flagway.

389
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,358
I'm sure he'll be stopping by your place.

390
00:26:15,378 --> 00:26:16,570
So tell him we'll meet again!

391
00:26:18,253 --> 00:26:19,260
Anyway, I'm in Milan to fix my plane.

392
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,287
You are in Italy?

393
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:22,202
You are an idiot!

394
00:26:22,222 --> 00:26:24,002
The Italians have a warrant out for your arrest, remember?

395
00:26:24,224 --> 00:26:26,103
Don't care how great your mechanic is over there.

396
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:28,002
You get back home you hear me?

397
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:32,197
Dont want to yell at you Marco.

398
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:34,607
If you keep acting so pigheaded,you gonna endup dead Cant go to another pilot's funeral.

399
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:37,017
Come home Sorry Baby!

400
00:26:37,037 --> 00:26:39,427
Gotta fly.

401
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,307
You jerk!

402
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,610
Is Porco Rosso dead or alive?

403
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,110
Good question.

404
00:27:35,164 --> 00:27:36,606
Hey Porco, I thought you would come here tonight.

405
00:27:36,626 --> 00:27:38,068
So I waited up.

406
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,708
She really took a beating this time.

407
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,044
Looks like you are missing half of the plane.

408
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,247
Wouldn't it be easier to build a new one?

409
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,916
I'm attached to this one.

410
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:48,555
Ah!Alright.

411
00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:49,829
It's your money Hey!

412
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:51,103
Lookout, I'm gonna back her in.

413
00:27:51,123 --> 00:27:52,377
Ok?

414
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,685
So tell me Piccolo, where did you find the girl?

415
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,021
That's my granddaughter, from America.

416
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,106
Keep coming, keep coming.

417
00:28:25,547 --> 00:28:27,826
Gorgeous fuselage, isn't Grandpa?

418
00:28:27,846 --> 00:28:30,125
Great lines.

419
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:34,096
Not many workers around who can do a job like that these days.

420
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,593
Well theres no resemblence.

421
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,809
Are you sure that girl is your granddaughter, Piccolo?

422
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,386
Keep away from here.

423
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,725
Fio, you alright getting the plane off the rig?

424
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:46,635
Sure.

425
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:47,431
No problem.

426
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:52,023
I gotta outfly an American named Curtiss and my business is in the toilet.

427
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,641
Curtiss?

428
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:55,103
I got just the engine.

429
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,327
What do you think?

430
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,333
This would give me some extra kick.

431
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,792
Don't ask how I got it.

432
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:11,300
All I can say is that it came from an Italian sea plane that lost the Schneider Cup to Curtiss in 1927.

433
00:29:11,677 --> 00:29:13,472
But it wasn't the engine's fault.

434
00:29:13,492 --> 00:29:15,287
The mechanic was an idiot.

435
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,299
I'll tune this up, just right.

436
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,766
But don't tune it up too delicately.I'm not flying this thing in a race, you know.

437
00:29:23,188 --> 00:29:25,319
You are talking to the God of engine-work here.

438
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:27,470
Trust me!

439
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,655
You plan on taking all of my money?

440
00:29:34,283 --> 00:29:36,624
Quit wining!

441
00:29:36,644 --> 00:29:38,985
These days money's barely worth the paper it's printed on.

442
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:40,936
You coming up short!

443
00:29:40,956 --> 00:29:42,688
Give me the money you got in your pocket.

444
00:29:42,874 --> 00:29:44,022
I need that.

445
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:45,190
I gotta pay for meals!

446
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,358
Hotel rooms, more meals.

447
00:29:46,628 --> 00:29:48,298
You can stay here.

448
00:29:48,318 --> 00:29:49,988
Meals included, I won't charge you much.

449
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:53,869
So Piccolo, haven't seen your sons  around.

450
00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:55,291
Are they alright?

451
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,220
They took off to find work.

452
00:29:57,514 --> 00:29:58,478
They took off?

453
00:29:58,498 --> 00:29:59,462
Then whose  gonna design my plane?

454
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,890
Fio will do it.

455
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,587
Fio?

456
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:03,884
That cute little girl?

457
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:06,402
Can't be such a pig.She's a talented  engineer.

458
00:30:06,422 --> 00:30:08,553
Even better than my sons.

459
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,783
No dice pack.

460
00:30:14,803 --> 00:30:16,807
I need a professional.

461
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:18,831
I'm  taking my worth money somewhere else.

462
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:20,855
Sorry Wait!

463
00:30:26,918 --> 00:30:28,633
Are you leaving because I'm a woman?

464
00:30:28,653 --> 00:30:30,368
Or is it because I'm too young?

465
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,414
Actually its both kiddo.

466
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,708
Ok that's fair.

467
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:39,430
But tell me, what's you think takes a pilot to be great?

468
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,889
Experience?

469
00:30:42,017 --> 00:30:43,061
No.

470
00:30:43,081 --> 00:30:44,125
It's intuition.

471
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,012
Hmm I just knew you weren't gonna say experience.

472
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:52,151
Grandpa said you flew solo in the first week and you were a great pilot.

473
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:52,777
Right from the very start.

474
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:53,244
Isn't that true?

475
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,116
Hmm yeah that was 1910 when I was 17.

476
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:01,268
17!

477
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:02,605
That's the same age I am!

478
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:08,163
I can't help being a woman, but I gurantee you I have talent.

479
00:31:08,543 --> 00:31:10,338
If I don't do a good job, you don't have to pay.

480
00:31:10,358 --> 00:31:12,153
Okay, Grandpa?

481
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,840
She's my grand daughter, she'll do fine.

482
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,669
Now with me, I was fixing engines at the age of 12.

483
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,174
Why don't you sleep on it.

484
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:22,242
I'm off to bed.

485
00:31:22,262 --> 00:31:24,199
Breakfast is at 7.

486
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:26,156
Left you a clean towel in the bathroom.  Good night!

487
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,117
Still don't have enough.

488
00:31:30,377 --> 00:31:34,317
But since you're a good friend, I've decided to loan you the rest.

489
00:32:18,697 --> 00:32:19,598
Good morning.

490
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:20,519
Did you sleep well?

491
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,191
You up all night?

492
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,034
Here's a rough draft of the design.

493
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:28,418
So what do you think?

494
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:31,488
I tweaked the wing section that should make the plane fly atleast five knots faster.

495
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:33,014
Look I dug up the original blueprints.

496
00:32:33,716 --> 00:32:35,779
The design is really radical.Huh?

497
00:32:37,095 --> 00:32:39,119
Wood monocco wings...

498
00:32:39,295 --> 00:32:41,172
with extreme angles of incidence!

499
00:32:41,247 --> 00:32:43,278
I've never seen anything like it.

500
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,944
Yeah they only made one.

501
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,428
Then they decided was too dangerous...

502
00:05:40,010 --> 00:19:19,753
No pilot could fly.

503
00:19:19,773 --> 00:32:59,516
I found it covered and dusted in a warehouse 00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,527 340   With the wings like that I'm really surprised that you can get it off the water.

504
00:32:59,988 --> 00:33:02,924
Takeoffs and landings can be a little bit tricky.

505
00:33:02,944 --> 00:33:05,880
But get it up to speed, she handles like a dream.

506
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:10,410
Why don't you try and increase the angle of incidence by half a degree on the wing.

507
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,578
The rest looks fine.

508
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:13,971
So you're giving me the job?

509
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,211
Thank you!

510
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:16,451
For trusting a woman!

511
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,965
Alright you got the job but on one condition,Fiona...

512
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:26,009
No more staying up all night or your work will start getting sloppy.

513
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,469
Also its truly bad for your complexion.

514
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,766
You got it.

515
00:33:31,793 --> 00:33:34,000
To be honest, I couldn't sleep last night because...

516
00:33:34,247 --> 00:33:38,248
I was afraid you wouldn't give me the job.

517
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:42,269
I should sleep fine tonight I'll go make some coffee and I'll get back to work.This is so exciting!

518
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,479
I can't wait to start building!

519
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:50,369
Don't tell me she plans on building the whole plane by herself!

520
00:33:57,304 --> 00:33:58,713
This is my niece Monica.

521
00:33:58,733 --> 00:34:00,142
Nice to meet you.

522
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:06,851
This is Ivana, my other niece her four daughters, Sophia, Laura, Constance and Valentina.

523
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:09,255
Fio's big sister Giliola.

524
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:11,141
Sandra she's my cousin.

525
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:13,027
Marietta, good to see you.

526
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:18,148
My sons' wives Maria, Tina, Anna, and the trio...showtime!

527
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:24,817
Porkalino!  Are you girls really still alive?

528
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:27,739
You pig!

529
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:29,341
We thought we get in on the action.

530
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:34,996
You are not here to build my plane, are you?

531
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:39,000
Yeah, we need to get some poker money.

532
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,796
So this is the crew, huh?

533
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,537
Don't you have any man relatives?

534
00:34:50,764 --> 00:34:52,855
All the men are gone.

535
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:54,966
They had to look elsewhere for work.

536
00:34:56,538 --> 00:34:57,669
This is work!

537
00:34:57,689 --> 00:34:58,820
Get them back...

538
00:34:59,024 --> 00:35:00,842
You mean a grate?

539
00:35:00,862 --> 00:35:02,680
Don't be such a pig.

540
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:04,393
You'll see, they're very hard workers.

541
00:35:04,593 --> 00:35:06,693
Yeah we're not baking a cake here!

542
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:19,263
Heavenly father, we give you thanks for putting bread on our table...

543
00:35:19,463 --> 00:35:26,717
and for giving us work when we were at the brink of bankruptcy Please forgive us for building a fighter plane with the help of women.

544
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,974
Amen Please eat and work on making that cake.

545
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:45,742
Hear that?

546
00:35:45,762 --> 00:35:47,352
You gonna whip pants off curtiss with this.

547
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:55,394
How do you think?

548
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:56,521
Too delicate?

549
00:35:56,655 --> 00:36:00,080
I think this might be bad for your shed, Piccolo.

550
00:36:00,835 --> 00:36:02,505
Yeah?

551
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:04,195
Wait till we turn it up to full speed.

552
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,449
Hmm, so you want to add a trim tab?

553
00:36:37,664 --> 00:36:38,503
Yeah.

554
00:36:38,523 --> 00:36:39,362
Can I?

555
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:44,081
Hmm I dunno, this is going to cost a lot of money.

556
00:36:44,629 --> 00:36:47,408
It's a great idea but we already gone way over budget.

557
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:50,207
See what the client think.

558
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,507
Porco...

559
00:36:55,974 --> 00:36:57,877
Would you stop looking at me like that, Fio.

560
00:36:57,897 --> 00:36:59,800
Just do what's best.

561
00:37:00,145 --> 00:37:02,225
That's great!

562
00:37:02,245 --> 00:37:04,325
I've already talked to the manufacturers.  I'll can get the orders filled right away!

563
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,103
I love you, Porco!

564
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,443
I give you three months to pay the bill.

565
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,900
Maybe I should just become an air pirate.

566
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,575
You like Fio, huh?

567
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:20,303
Don't touch her.

568
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:21,345
Don't worry.

569
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:22,271
Just looking at her makes me tired.

570
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:37,565
Ferrarin, look at you.

571
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:38,851
You are a major now.

572
00:38:38,993 --> 00:38:40,872
Marco you crazy!

573
00:38:40,892 --> 00:38:42,771
What you doing back in Italy?

574
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,997
I make a loot come and go, as I please.

575
00:38:44,749 --> 00:38:46,917
The secret police already know you are in the country.

576
00:38:46,937 --> 00:38:49,105
Were you followed?

577
00:38:49,225 --> 00:38:54,014
Yeah.

578
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:58,823
I gave em the slip You gotta get outta Italy now.

579
00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:03,632
I've seen your arrest warrant deserting the Italian Air force, entering the country illegally, being a blatantly unpatriotic pig This is no time to laugh, Marco!

580
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,478
They got it in for you, they want to confiscate your plane.

581
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,390
Man, this movie stinks.

582
00:39:10,942 --> 00:39:13,510
Marco why don't you come back to the Air Force?

583
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,098
I got influence now I can work something out.

584
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:18,242
Thanks for the offer.

585
00:39:18,262 --> 00:39:19,556
But I rather be a pig than a Fascist.

586
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,942
Then you better keep your plane off the skies.

587
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:26,123
The only way the Italians will let you fly is if you fly for our country.

588
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:30,080
I only fly for myself.

589
00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:32,713
You really are a pig, aren't you?

590
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:36,210
You realise if they can a pig, they won't give you a fair trial.

591
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,090
I understand.Thanks Ferrarin.

592
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,800
Give my regards to the guys.

593
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,304
This movie is really great.

594
00:39:41,973 --> 00:39:43,688
Alright I'll try to lookout for you.

595
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,423
But I can only do so much.

596
00:39:45,645 --> 00:39:47,251
Sure.

597
00:39:47,271 --> 00:39:48,877
Well so long friend.

598
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:09,036
Hey Porco, need a ride?

599
00:40:13,029 --> 00:40:15,002
Slide over.

600
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:25,343
I borrowed this truck so we can take the seaplane to the lake..

601
00:40:25,543 --> 00:40:27,343
We're ready to give it a test flight.

602
00:40:27,518 --> 00:40:28,772
No test flights.

603
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:30,046
I'm gettin' out of here today.

604
00:40:31,272 --> 00:40:32,964
That's ridiculous!

605
00:40:32,984 --> 00:40:34,676
I refuse to give you the plane without testing it.

606
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,563
Plus it will take atleast a day to take the plane apart and transport it to the lake.

607
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,988
I don't have a choice.

608
00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:43,216
I want you to take a good look behind this van.

609
00:40:43,326 --> 00:40:45,000
Do it slowly.

610
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:46,911
Thats the Fascist Secret Police.

611
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,914
They're following us.

612
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:51,819
Following us?

613
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:52,866
What for?

614
00:40:53,378 --> 00:40:56,032
Because they like my pretty red plane.

615
00:40:56,052 --> 00:40:58,706
Problem is they don't like me flying it.

616
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,546
Hey, are you a spy or something?

617
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,719
A spy?

618
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:14,467
That's the last thing I ever do kid.

619
00:41:14,487 --> 00:41:16,265
I don't look after myself.

620
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,190
But you were a hero during the war, right?

621
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,113
Well this is really strange if you haven't done anything wrong!

622
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,566
Couldn't agree with you more.

623
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:26,566
Hold on!

624
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,697
How about we try another direction?

625
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,971
Looks like you done this kind of thing before.

626
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,260
Everytime I go to Milan kiddo.

627
00:42:17,685 --> 00:42:19,000
The plane's ready than you were.

628
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,837
Two secret police are hiding out back and three in the front.

629
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,934
This is so exciting!

630
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,599
Calm down woman, you rambling.

631
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:27,748
What?

632
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,517
Thanks Take care.

633
00:42:31,657 --> 00:42:45,692
I will Fio, what do you think you doing?

634
00:42:46,449 --> 00:42:47,335
I'm rigging up my seat.

635
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:48,241
Just give me about five seconds.

636
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:49,147
Ok?

637
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,989
You are crazy if you think I'm letting you fly along with me.

638
00:42:54,499 --> 00:42:55,713
Shh!

639
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:56,947
The secret police will hear you.

640
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,001
Fio!

641
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,112
There's a warrant out for my arrest, you realize?

642
00:43:03,132 --> 00:43:05,114
This is not a joyride sweetheart,so if you...

643
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,671
Hold this a second please.

644
00:43:08,137 --> 00:43:09,118
Thank you.

645
00:43:09,138 --> 00:43:10,119
Look at this.

646
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:11,120
Tada!

647
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,680
I just wipped this together.

648
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,120
And it fits perfectly...

649
00:43:14,226 --> 00:43:16,678
It's a bit of a tight fit but it should do.

650
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,222
Would you hold this please?

651
00:43:20,092 --> 00:43:23,896
Fio this is way too dangerous!

652
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:27,720
I'll be taking it from the canal out back I don't even know if I can get her off the water!

653
00:43:29,035 --> 00:43:30,352
Eh,hmm.

654
00:43:30,372 --> 00:43:31,689
I know!

655
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,026
That's why you need to have the engineer with you.

656
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,126
So that I can make adjustments to the plane Don't you get it?

657
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:37,025
I'm off to fight Curtiss.

658
00:43:37,236 --> 00:43:39,750
I'll have bullets flying over my head!

659
00:43:40,094 --> 00:43:42,887
I can handle that.

660
00:43:42,907 --> 00:43:45,700
I'm responsible for this plane and I wanna do my first job right!

661
00:43:45,842 --> 00:43:48,962
Think about it.

662
00:43:48,982 --> 00:43:52,102
I'm a known womanizer, I live on a deserted island in a small tent.

663
00:43:52,257 --> 00:43:52,996
That's great.

664
00:43:53,016 --> 00:43:53,755
I love camping.

665
00:43:53,975 --> 00:43:55,137
That's not the point.

666
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,765
Take her.

667
00:43:57,785 --> 00:43:59,240
I'll give you a good deal on the salary.

668
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,715
And I know she will come handy.

669
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,899
Besides I want you back in business, so that I can get paid.

670
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,734
You are this girl's grandfather?

671
00:44:06,154 --> 00:44:08,182
It'll be good for her.

672
00:44:08,202 --> 00:44:10,230
And I'll install this so you two can chit chat.

673
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,451
So you are okay with turning her into an outlaw?

674
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,572
Ehmm..Hmm I'm going along as your hostage.

675
00:44:16,831 --> 00:44:21,941
See that way all my relatives can tell the police that they had no choice but to help you!  So please Porco, let me come.

676
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:27,071
I can help you.

677
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:31,133
You better take out one of the machine guns.

678
00:44:31,153 --> 00:44:32,317
What?

679
00:44:33,097 --> 00:44:35,413
Theres not enough space even with your tiny butt.

680
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:37,749
Now take out a gun.

681
00:44:37,894 --> 00:44:39,224
Thank you!

682
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:40,574
And you know my butt is bigger than it looks.

683
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,924
I'll have to get out in 2 secs.

684
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:47,603
If we hang around here much longer, you and the old ladies might come.

685
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,896
And that will cost you a lotta mullah!

686
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,075
Grandma get out of the way!

687
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,448
Hey Fio, you bring back souvenirs.

688
00:44:56,648 --> 00:44:57,248
I will.

689
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,421
Contact!

690
00:45:16,554 --> 00:45:18,261
Open the door!

691
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,308
Go!

692
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,108
Get down!

693
00:45:47,797 --> 00:45:49,552
Kidnapper!

694
00:45:49,572 --> 00:45:51,327
Give back our girl Fio!

695
00:45:51,537 --> 00:45:53,137
Bring Fio back!

696
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,634
How's the steering, Porco?

697
00:46:01,852 --> 00:46:03,732
It's crazy, just like you, Fio.

698
00:46:03,752 --> 00:46:05,632
Its even harder than handle before!

699
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,360
Stop the plane.I'll make some adjustments.

700
00:46:11,529 --> 00:46:12,931
No we don't have time.

701
00:46:12,951 --> 00:46:14,353
I'll get her up in the air somehow.

702
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,868
I can't get enough lift!

703
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:21,988
Porco there's a ship!

704
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,042
Get her up!

705
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,082
Come on, baby!

706
00:46:32,675 --> 00:46:33,867
The eorons hitting the water.

707
00:46:33,887 --> 00:46:35,079
Use the trim tabs.

708
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:35,880
The what?

709
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,415
It's the crate on your right.

710
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,596
Hurry!

711
00:46:52,695 --> 00:46:53,949
Got it.

712
00:46:53,969 --> 00:46:55,223
Here we go.

713
00:47:30,775 --> 00:47:32,257
Gorgeous!

714
00:47:32,277 --> 00:47:33,759
This is such an incredible view!

715
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,277
Is that plane following us?

716
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,658
Its someone from the Italian Air force.

717
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,883
Hey!

718
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:45,776
Looks like my old buddy Ferrarin is here.

719
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,081
What's he saying?

720
00:47:55,257 --> 00:47:57,348
He says the Air force has a trap for us up ahead.

721
00:47:57,368 --> 00:47:59,459
Knows show how we can get outta here!

722
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,528
If we fly low all the way home, we should stay outta their range.

723
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,450
Thank you very much, my friend!

724
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,820
Thank you!

725
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,420
Very funny!

726
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,420
What did he say?

727
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,165
He said "Cute girl, when did you start babysitting"?

728
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:43,235
Alas!

729
00:49:43,255 --> 00:49:45,480
A solitary rose blooms in the secret garden.

730
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,904
That's my favorite line from a screenplay I wrote.

731
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,995
Mr.Curtiss, why are you trespassing in my garden.

732
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,501
I've something special to show you.

733
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,755
It's from Hollywood.

734
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:19,233
“Dear Mr.Curtiss, In regards to the screenplay you sent us...” "We would love to produce it and we would consider you for the lead" The script's title is the Rose of the Adriatic.

735
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,267
That sounds wonderful.

736
00:50:20,444 --> 00:50:21,425
Really?

737
00:50:21,445 --> 00:50:22,426
Then it's settled.

738
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:25,273
Gina, come to Hollywood with me.

739
00:50:27,576 --> 00:50:29,581
I've got great aspirations.

740
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:31,606
I'm already a big celebrity as a pilot!

741
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,623
Soon I'll be a Hollywood star.

742
00:50:34,767 --> 00:50:35,346
And then...

743
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:35,945
There's more?

744
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,126
The President!

745
00:50:45,844 --> 00:50:47,451
What's so funny?

746
00:50:47,471 --> 00:50:49,078
I'm serious!

747
00:50:49,098 --> 00:50:50,705
Don't you wanna be the First Lady?

748
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,172
Gina!

749
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,308
I find your humility very charming.

750
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,471
So you come with me?

751
00:50:58,899 --> 00:51:00,614
No I can't.

752
00:51:00,634 --> 00:51:02,349
I've a long standing bet coming here!

753
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:08,315
I bet myself that if a certain man comes to visit me when...

754
00:51:08,475 --> 00:51:11,615
I'm out here in my garden,that the two of us will fall in love.

755
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,998
But that fool only comes to my restaurant at night.

756
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,164
He never stops and shows his face in the daylight.

757
00:52:01,837 --> 00:52:02,841
Porco?

758
00:52:02,861 --> 00:52:03,865
I thought he was dead!

759
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,270
You fool.

760
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,874
He left without landing.

761
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:18,649
My luck I lose again.

762
00:53:18,831 --> 00:53:20,296
What?

763
00:53:20,316 --> 00:53:21,781
You chose that stupid pig over me?

764
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,413
That's right.

765
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:27,959
Love is a little bit more complicated here than it is in America.

766
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:34,469
Falling in love, happens to you all the time So have fun in Hollywood, little boy.

767
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,175
Little boy?

768
00:53:40,477 --> 00:53:41,542
Hey!

769
00:53:41,562 --> 00:53:42,627
Watch it with the acrobatics.

770
00:53:42,647 --> 00:53:43,712
You made me bump my head.

771
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:46,140
I'm just saying hi to a friend.

772
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,188
Gina of the Hotel Adriano?

773
00:53:49,945 --> 00:53:52,048
She was the Lady in the white dress, wasn't she?

774
00:53:52,068 --> 00:53:54,171
My grandfather told me...

775
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,990
that all seaplane pilots of the Adriatic fall madly in love with Gina.

776
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,782
That's wonderful Fio.

777
00:54:01,415 --> 00:54:03,085
So is Gina really your friend?

778
00:54:03,105 --> 00:54:04,775
Or are you in love with her too?

779
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,738
It's time to refuel!

780
00:54:06,758 --> 00:54:08,286
Turn around, quit yapping and get your butt in your seat.

781
00:54:08,422 --> 00:54:09,198
What!

782
00:54:09,218 --> 00:54:09,994
Hey wait!

783
00:54:35,073 --> 00:54:36,390
Hey!

784
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:37,727
What's a girl doing up Porco's plane?

785
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,152
Where's Porco?

786
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,746
He's having a serious conversation with my dad.

787
00:54:46,146 --> 00:54:47,247
Both the new government and the old royalist...

788
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:51,168
have started striking deals with seaplane pirates.

789
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:55,005
You are not gonna make a penny hunting pirates these days, Porco.

790
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,090
There you go.

791
00:54:56,156 --> 00:54:57,048
Thanks.

792
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,888
Well sounds like you are out of a job Porco!

793
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,768
You should join up with one of the two factions.

794
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,895
They pay good money for skills like yours.

795
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,229
You betcha.

796
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,562
Specially after Curtiss goes back to America.

797
00:55:11,693 --> 00:55:13,448
America?

798
00:55:13,468 --> 00:55:15,223
You're the ones who should be going to America.

799
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:20,072
Farewell to the freedome in Adriatic and to days in god abandon.

800
00:55:20,661 --> 00:55:21,227
What is that?

801
00:55:21,247 --> 00:55:21,813
Shakespeare?

802
00:55:21,954 --> 00:55:22,918
No, it's Porco.

803
00:55:22,938 --> 00:55:23,902
See you later.

804
00:55:24,134 --> 00:55:25,381
So long.

805
00:55:30,879 --> 00:55:32,383
The price of gas here is ridiculous.

806
00:55:32,403 --> 00:55:33,907
He's charging us 3 times what we pay in Italy.

807
00:55:36,051 --> 00:55:36,970
Don't be such a crook.

808
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:37,909
Be reasonable.

809
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,385
Here in the Adriatic Islands, we don't dilute our gas like Italians do.

810
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,592
Can you please explain that to her, Porco?

811
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:46,719
Just pay the kid, Fio.

812
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:51,440
Then plant your butt that looks bigger than it looks back in the cubby hall.

813
00:55:51,544 --> 00:55:53,471
We're taking off with my hat out.

814
00:55:53,635 --> 00:55:55,105
Fine!

815
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:56,595
The gas money is going on your bill anyway!

816
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:04,234
So when do we fight Curtiss?

817
00:56:04,254 --> 00:56:07,169
No need to now.  I'm outta a job, no ones hiring bounty hunters these days!

818
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:10,385
What about your honor?

819
00:56:10,405 --> 00:56:13,508
You can't let Curtiss run around acting like he shot you down .

820
00:56:13,624 --> 00:56:14,695
I'm a pig!

821
00:56:14,715 --> 00:56:15,786
I don't fight for honor.

822
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:16,877
I fight for a paycheck.

823
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:37,819
It's beautiful!

824
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,254
What a fantastic hideout.

825
00:56:57,799 --> 00:56:59,469
Agh!

826
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:01,159
It's good to stretch my legs.

827
00:57:17,945 --> 00:57:19,387
Ah!

828
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:20,849
Looks like my hideout isn't so hidden anyway.

829
00:57:20,989 --> 00:57:22,016
Boss!

830
00:57:22,036 --> 00:57:23,063
We got the pig!

831
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,826
Get off me!

832
00:57:26,011 --> 00:57:27,619
Out of the way!

833
00:57:27,961 --> 00:57:30,114
You're finished, pig.

834
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,865
It's payback time.

835
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,038
We've got scores to settle.

836
00:57:35,295 --> 00:57:36,702
A girl!

837
00:57:36,722 --> 00:57:38,129
We got a girl here!

838
00:57:38,223 --> 00:57:39,139
She's cute.

839
00:57:39,341 --> 00:57:40,738
So what?

840
00:57:40,758 --> 00:57:42,155
Half the world population is women.

841
00:57:42,175 --> 00:57:43,572
Idiot!

842
00:57:44,804 --> 00:57:46,959
Hey Fio is no ordinary girl!

843
00:57:46,979 --> 00:57:49,134
She's a first class seaplane engineer.

844
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,134
But she's so young.

845
00:57:51,154 --> 00:57:52,989
And pretty!

846
00:57:53,214 --> 00:57:54,157
A girl engineer?

847
00:57:54,177 --> 00:57:55,120
Are you sure?

848
00:57:55,246 --> 00:57:58,169
She redesigned my plane and now it flies better than ever.

849
00:57:58,269 --> 00:58:01,189
She's young, but she's a genius!

850
00:58:01,298 --> 00:58:02,217
Wooh?

851
00:58:02,237 --> 00:58:03,156
You really mean that?

852
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,892
Hey!

853
00:58:04,912 --> 00:58:06,564
I never lie about my seaplane, kid.

854
00:58:06,742 --> 00:58:08,595
Treat her with respect.

855
00:58:08,615 --> 00:58:10,468
She came along just to make sure I pay my bill.

856
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:12,974
So you're in debt, too?

857
00:58:12,994 --> 00:58:14,063
It serves you right!

858
00:58:14,251 --> 00:58:17,697
Hey what do you say, we smash his stupid red plane to bits.

859
00:58:17,717 --> 00:58:21,163
And leave him here to rot and dead?

860
00:58:21,308 --> 00:58:22,681
Smash it?

861
00:58:22,701 --> 00:58:24,074
You destroy a work of art?

862
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:31,092
It happens to be a one of a kind Savoy-S21   We realize it's a nice plane...

863
00:58:31,171 --> 00:58:32,108
but we have our reaons.

864
00:58:32,436 --> 00:58:33,253
Yeah?

865
00:58:33,273 --> 00:58:34,090
What are they?

866
00:58:34,196 --> 00:58:35,527
Well it's kinda complicated.

867
00:58:35,547 --> 00:58:36,878
And you call yourselves seaplane pilots?

868
00:58:37,107 --> 00:58:38,174
Step aside.

869
00:58:38,194 --> 00:58:39,261
Watch the shoes!

870
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:53,000
My grandpa has been telling me stories of seaplane pirates ever since I was born.

871
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:59,093
He says seaplane pirates are the most honorable and trustworthy fighters in the world!.

872
00:58:59,185 --> 00:59:04,215
Everytime they fly both the ocean and the sky purify their hearts.

873
00:59:04,366 --> 00:59:07,105
So they're braver than any pilot in the sky...

874
00:59:07,225 --> 00:59:09,329
and they are mightier than any sailor in the sea!.

875
00:59:11,266 --> 00:59:13,044
Ms.Fio!

876
00:59:13,064 --> 00:59:14,842
Thank you, you make me proud to be a seaplane pirate.

877
00:59:15,007 --> 00:59:17,861
And you should be, I can tell it's not about money or revenge.

878
00:59:17,881 --> 00:59:20,735
You are about honor!

879
00:59:22,855 --> 00:59:23,092
Yeah!

880
00:59:23,112 --> 00:59:23,349
That's right, Fio!

881
00:59:23,369 --> 00:59:23,606
Yeah To honor!

882
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:30,486
Now that girl is something else.

883
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:37,009
Ok Ms.Fio, we respect you so we'll not destroy the plane that you made!

884
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,001
But we still hate that stinkin' pig's gut and we want payback.

885
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,449
Slice that pig to bacon!

886
00:59:42,469 --> 00:59:44,818
Yeah!

887
00:59:44,952 --> 00:59:46,831
What are you morons talking about?

888
00:59:46,802 --> 00:59:48,705
You can't gangup on a fellow sea plane pilot!

889
00:59:48,725 --> 00:59:50,628
Where is your honor?

890
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,678
You ought to be completely ashamed of yourselves!

891
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:57,978
A real seaplane pirate would never fight in a pack like bunch of cowards!

892
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:02,521
Look at Porco, he just came back so that we could have a re-match with Curtiss.

893
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:06,358
And defend his reputation like a real sea pirate should.

894
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:10,491
So if you wanna fight Porco honorably then you fight him in the sky!

895
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:12,715
One on one.

896
01:00:12,735 --> 01:00:13,290
I would fight Porco...

897
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,199
but my plane has engine trouble.

898
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:16,750
You big liar!

899
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:18,190
Quit makin' excuses.

900
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,825
What should we do, Boss?

901
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:20,816
She did make some good points.

902
01:00:20,836 --> 01:00:21,692
Yeah!

903
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,216
We should pick someone who can fight Porco.

904
01:00:24,236 --> 01:00:26,532
I think we should talk to Curtiss.

905
01:00:26,675 --> 01:00:28,014
Wait a minute!

906
01:00:28,034 --> 01:00:29,373
Asking him to fight the pig again?

907
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:31,716
Only Curtiss can beat him.

908
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,010
The contract with him has already expired!

909
01:00:37,228 --> 01:00:38,114
Howdy fellas!

910
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,020
What?

911
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:39,926
It's Curtiss!

912
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,436
What's he doin' here?

913
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:45,007
I followed ya' all!

914
01:00:45,027 --> 01:00:46,884
I knew you get into trouble without me!

915
01:00:48,864 --> 01:00:50,596
Nice goin' Fio.

916
01:00:50,616 --> 01:00:52,348
Look at the mess you got me into now.

917
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,079
Here..hold these.

918
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,131
So do you want me to challenge for a rematch do you, pig?

919
01:01:12,512 --> 01:01:15,308
Why should I give it to ya?

920
01:01:15,328 --> 01:01:18,124
I won once already and my contract with these boys is expired.

921
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,729
Well give us a proposition?

922
01:01:19,749 --> 01:01:20,918
What do you want?

923
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,281
Beautiful!

924
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,947
Tell you what, if I win will you marry me darlin'?

925
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,615
That's what I want.

926
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:44,195
Fine with me!

927
01:01:44,215 --> 01:01:46,619
But if Porco beats you, then you ought to pay the debt he owes me.

928
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,079
Don't do it, Fio!

929
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:50,090
Eh, backup!.

930
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,968
Ms.Fio are you quite ceratin you wanna do this?

931
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,803
You should ask him not me.

932
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,767
These bills are kinda expensive.

933
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:01,976
No they're not!

934
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,762
Are you gonna fight or not?

935
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,307
I'll gladly fight for the woman that I love!

936
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,649
Good!

937
01:02:09,486 --> 01:02:11,617
Alright!

938
01:02:11,637 --> 01:02:13,768
The fight will take place first thing tomorrow morning!.

939
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:17,489
Since Fio is doing such an honorable thing, my gang will host!

940
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,340
Hey we like to host too!

941
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,080
Yeah!

942
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,820
Yeah!

943
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:28,169
See you later, Ms.Fio!

944
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:31,836
This is ridiculous!

945
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,842
Don't forget to show up, pig!

946
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:38,843
Shut up, just go home already!

947
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,344
Ok!

948
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:48,978
What on Earth possessed you, to make that deal?

949
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:53,858
Well I'm sorry, I guess I shouldn't have been ameaned.

950
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,100
I'm just a stupid little girl!

951
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,027
Fio?

952
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:04,702
I should thank you for saving my life back there!

953
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,208
You really put yourself on the line.

954
01:03:07,836 --> 01:03:09,756
So thanks.

955
01:03:09,776 --> 01:03:11,696
It looks like we are into this thing together now.

956
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,832
So you'll fight Curtiss?

957
01:03:15,844 --> 01:03:18,308
He could win you know.

958
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:20,792
Hmm You got more honor.

959
01:03:22,309 --> 01:03:25,002
Honor?

960
01:03:25,022 --> 01:03:27,715
I hate that word, but somehow when you say it doesn't sound so bad..

961
01:03:33,403 --> 01:03:35,274
What's the matter with you?

962
01:03:35,294 --> 01:03:37,165
Are you cold?

963
01:03:37,185 --> 01:03:39,056
Fio> Oh Boy!.

964
01:03:39,868 --> 01:03:42,705
I'm shaking allover.

965
01:03:42,725 --> 01:03:45,562
My heart's pounding like crazy I guess I was really scared .

966
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:48,872
I just didn't know you would fight for me Porco!

967
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:52,969
Woah!

968
01:03:52,989 --> 01:03:53,578
What you doin'?

969
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,252
I need a swim.

970
01:04:14,861 --> 01:04:15,803
Oh No!

971
01:04:15,823 --> 01:04:16,765
What?

972
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,153
What's wrong?

973
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:22,117
I really lew it Porco.

974
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,149
I should have padded those bills!

975
01:04:24,249 --> 01:04:25,449
Curtiss would have paid a lot more!

976
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,582
You're right!

977
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:24,879
Porco?

978
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,890
Can't you sleep?

979
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:30,639
I saw...

980
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:33,896
Maybe it was a dream.

981
01:05:35,066 --> 01:05:36,531
Go back to sleep.

982
01:05:36,551 --> 01:05:38,016
We gotta big day tomorrow.

983
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,645
Porco?

984
01:05:41,197 --> 01:05:42,349
Yeah?

985
01:05:42,369 --> 01:05:43,521
Why did you turn into a pig?

986
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:44,641
Hmm..

987
01:05:44,661 --> 01:05:45,352
All middle aged men are pigs!

988
01:05:46,953 --> 01:05:49,669
You know I've heard a lot about Capt.Marco Rossolini.

989
01:05:49,689 --> 01:05:52,405
My father was in his fighter unit.

990
01:05:53,001 --> 01:05:56,318
He told me that Marco once landed a seaplane in raging sea...  to save the life of an enemy pilot.

991
01:05:56,338 --> 01:05:59,655
I think that's amazing!

992
01:06:04,721 --> 01:06:05,702
I got it!

993
01:06:05,722 --> 01:06:06,703
What if I kiss you Porco?

994
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:13,725
Yeah you heard the fairy tale where the girl kisses the frog and turns him back to a handsome prince?

995
01:06:14,063 --> 01:06:15,378
Cmon!

996
01:06:15,398 --> 01:06:16,713
You gotta save it for somebody special.

997
01:06:16,733 --> 01:06:18,048
For crying out loud.

998
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:21,736
Don't you like me?

999
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:25,732
You're a great kid.

1000
01:06:26,075 --> 01:06:28,541
You know what Fio?

1001
01:06:28,561 --> 01:06:31,027
Seeing you makes me wish I shouldn't have given up being human.

1002
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,406
Now go to sleep.

1003
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,125
First tell me a story, then I'll goto sleep.

1004
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:42,583
Alright Here's a winner!

1005
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:54,010
It was the last summer of the great war...

1006
01:06:55,303 --> 01:07:01,561
We were flying over the Adriatic, on a routine survellience patrol heading to Istria.

1007
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:09,618
My good buddy Berlini was right beside me.

1008
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:14,580
He had just gotten married to Gina from the Hotel Adriana.

1009
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:18,627
And I was his best man.

1010
01:07:19,228 --> 01:07:23,419
But the war called so he had to go back to battle right after the ceremony.

1011
01:07:32,893 --> 01:07:36,318
Suddenly we were in the middle of the worst dogfight in my life.

1012
01:07:42,689 --> 01:07:46,317
Friends and enemies were falling around me like flies.

1013
01:07:46,525 --> 01:07:50,494
I had 3 planes trying to chase me down.

1014
01:07:50,646 --> 01:07:53,535
And all I thought about was myself.

1015
01:07:53,555 --> 01:07:56,444
Soon I realised I was the only one left from my unit.

1016
01:07:56,749 --> 01:07:59,170
But the enemy never let up.

1017
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:01,611
I feel my guts out trying to get away.

1018
01:08:01,963 --> 01:08:04,654
My hands and feet went numb.

1019
01:08:04,674 --> 01:08:07,365
I could feel myself starting to blackout.

1020
01:08:07,485 --> 01:08:11,846
I was sure I was gonna die then suddenly everything around me turned white.

1021
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,131
White?

1022
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:16,055
Yeah, it was the strangest thing I ever seen.

1023
01:08:17,244 --> 01:08:21,000
A light that was so pure, I figured I must be in heaven.

1024
01:08:21,129 --> 01:08:23,162
Then I realized that I had flown into a cloud.

1025
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:25,215
I was so exhausted that...

1026
01:08:25,325 --> 01:08:27,525
I couldn't hold the stick to fly my plane.

1027
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:31,066
But the plane just kept on flying.

1028
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,931
Flew by itself?

1029
01:08:59,395 --> 01:09:02,214
Yeah it was perfectly quiet.

1030
01:09:02,234 --> 01:09:05,053
And the sky was beautiful...

1031
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:10,564
then I saw this strange white band high above me.

1032
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,430
Berlini, I thought you were dead!

1033
01:09:44,107 --> 01:09:45,259
Come back here!

1034
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:46,431
Where do you think you are going?

1035
01:09:59,455 --> 01:10:01,187
What about Gina?

1036
01:10:01,207 --> 01:10:02,939
You can't leave her alone.

1037
01:10:03,092 --> 01:10:03,843
Let me go instead!

1038
01:10:03,863 --> 01:10:04,614
Hold on!

1039
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:50,164
When I came to, I was skimming just above the sea, all alone.

1040
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:56,169
God was telling you, it wasn't your time yet.

1041
01:10:58,214 --> 01:11:00,597
You think?

1042
01:11:00,617 --> 01:11:03,000
Seems to me, he was telling me maybe I was a pig and I deserved to be all alone.

1043
01:11:03,311 --> 01:11:04,565
You can't believe that!

1044
01:11:04,585 --> 01:11:05,839
You're a good person!

1045
01:11:06,381 --> 01:11:08,078
No!

1046
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:09,795
The good ones are the ones who died.

1047
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:11,512
Or maybe I'm dead, life as a pig.

1048
01:11:12,111 --> 01:11:13,553
It's the same thing as hell.

1049
01:11:13,573 --> 01:11:15,015
Now go to sleep.

1050
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:20,117
That stupid kid, he sold me rusted cartridges.

1051
01:11:22,497 --> 01:11:25,003
I think you are a great human being, Porco.

1052
01:11:25,023 --> 01:11:27,529
I'm glad you're still around.

1053
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:29,581
Good night!

1054
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:57,071
Place your bets here!

1055
01:11:58,699 --> 01:12:00,289
Box seats here!

1056
01:12:00,309 --> 01:12:01,899
Place your wager!

1057
01:12:12,171 --> 01:12:14,612
Buncha morons!

1058
01:12:14,632 --> 01:12:17,073
They'll turn this into a big party Are all of these people air pirates?

1059
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:19,578
No they are trash all over the Mediterranean.

1060
01:12:19,598 --> 01:12:21,916
Gangsters, smugglers, gamblers...

1061
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:25,592
Yeah you might have a handful of few respectful people but I doubt it.

1062
01:12:26,736 --> 01:12:28,256
Wow!

1063
01:12:28,276 --> 01:12:29,796
Not only will I get a wife but also will be getting more famous!

1064
01:12:30,398 --> 01:12:31,988
Ten minutes to start!

1065
01:12:32,008 --> 01:12:33,598
Ten minutes to start!

1066
01:12:34,277 --> 01:12:36,931
Listen up!

1067
01:12:36,951 --> 01:12:39,605
This is a final bouter between Porco Rosso and Donald Curtiss.

1068
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:46,120
So if one of you fights dirty, you'll be disrespected by seaplane pilots for eternity !

1069
01:12:46,414 --> 01:12:48,255
Cmon!

1070
01:12:48,275 --> 01:12:50,116
No speeches, no speeches!

1071
01:12:53,588 --> 01:12:55,508
Quite down !

1072
01:12:55,528 --> 01:12:57,448
The next person I hear whining is dead meat!

1073
01:13:06,726 --> 01:13:07,855
Why not drop a bomb?

1074
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:09,004
Really gets them quite.

1075
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:13,278
This fight will decides the fate of Ms.Fio...

1076
01:13:14,378 --> 01:13:14,685
who you all love and respect!

1077
01:13:14,705 --> 01:13:15,012
So keep your mouth shut.

1078
01:13:16,569 --> 01:13:18,660
You got that?

1079
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,771
If you do clap your hands, clap now!

1080
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:24,158
Let's get started already!

1081
01:13:24,285 --> 01:13:27,790
Shut up pig!

1082
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:31,315
We're following official procedures Now both you place your bets on these chairs!

1083
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:38,335
Thank you.

1084
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:40,500
Set it down, moron!

1085
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:48,137
If both sides are satisfied, you should shake hands or something like that!

1086
01:13:48,267 --> 01:13:49,646
Forget it.

1087
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:51,045
I like to keep my hands clean.

1088
01:13:53,356 --> 01:13:54,269
Shh!

1089
01:13:54,289 --> 01:13:55,202
Alright!

1090
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:56,135
Let's just get on with it.

1091
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,143
We'll go to the church as soon as this is over!

1092
01:14:00,029 --> 01:14:01,443
Ah!

1093
01:14:01,463 --> 01:14:02,877
Don't worry Fio.

1094
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:04,311
Accordin' to ma sweet mama it isn't love that counts! .

1095
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,663
Fio, can we take a picture with you?

1096
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:12,828
We took a bath!

1097
01:14:12,959 --> 01:14:13,878
Ok?

1098
01:14:13,898 --> 01:14:14,817
Everybody ready?

1099
01:14:15,294 --> 01:14:15,820
Cheese!

1100
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,366
Smile!

1101
01:14:38,734 --> 01:14:40,136
Place your bets here!

1102
01:14:40,156 --> 01:14:41,558
Three mins to Curtiss in favor!

1103
01:14:41,737 --> 01:14:43,390
This is great!

1104
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:45,063
We should get them to do this every month!

1105
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,411
15 seconds to start.

1106
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:55,548
Wow!

1107
01:14:55,568 --> 01:14:56,407
I got chills.

1108
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:58,749
Five seconds...

1109
01:14:58,869 --> 01:14:59,745
Four...

1110
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:00,746
Three...

1111
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:01,747
Two...

1112
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:02,589
One...

1113
01:15:02,717 --> 01:15:06,326
Go!

1114
01:15:06,346 --> 01:15:09,955
Go!

1115
01:15:09,975 --> 01:15:13,584
Go Curtiss is up first!

1116
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,454
It looks like its gonna be a one sided fight!

1117
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:34,613
Gimme those!

1118
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:42,168
Porco!

1119
01:15:42,188 --> 01:15:42,976
What you doing?

1120
01:15:42,996 --> 01:15:43,784
Get some altitude!

1121
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:46,167
He'll be eating bullets if he climbs up now.

1122
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,270
He being tricky.

1123
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:51,270
It will be harder for Curtiss to hit him if is closer to the water.

1124
01:15:55,269 --> 01:15:56,608
Aha!

1125
01:15:56,628 --> 01:15:57,967
You are trying to make me waste my bullets, aren't you?

1126
01:16:14,121 --> 01:16:15,375
Look at that!

1127
01:16:15,395 --> 01:16:16,649
Porco gave him the loop.

1128
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:17,828
Whats the loop?

1129
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:21,161
The loop is what made Porco the Ace of the Adriatic!

1130
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:27,333
He's got me!

1131
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:34,507
He's gonna shoot!

1132
01:16:39,313 --> 01:16:40,241
Look he's not shooting!

1133
01:16:40,261 --> 01:16:41,189
What's wrong?

1134
01:16:41,209 --> 01:16:42,137
Is his machinegun jammed?

1135
01:16:42,483 --> 01:16:44,386
I think I know what's going on here.

1136
01:16:44,406 --> 01:16:46,309
Porco won't shoot a pilot!

1137
01:16:47,113 --> 01:16:49,392
He'll always shoot the plane!

1138
01:16:49,412 --> 01:16:51,691
Look, there he's in perfect position!

1139
01:16:51,867 --> 01:16:52,433
Cmon!

1140
01:16:52,453 --> 01:16:53,019
Shoot!

1141
01:16:53,536 --> 01:16:54,631
No!

1142
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:55,746
He's not going for it!

1143
01:16:55,766 --> 01:16:56,861
Just as I thought!

1144
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,199
If the pig shoots now, he'll kill Curtiss.

1145
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:04,875
I bet he plans to tire Curtiss out and shoot his engine up instead.

1146
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:07,000
What a show-off.

1147
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:09,587
Porco...

1148
01:17:10,469 --> 01:17:11,997
Are you messin' with me?

1149
01:17:12,017 --> 01:17:13,545
Cmon shoot!

1150
01:17:14,649 --> 01:17:15,691
Ah!

1151
01:17:15,711 --> 01:17:16,753
I bet your gun is jammed!

1152
01:17:16,773 --> 01:17:17,815
Isn't?

1153
01:17:17,835 --> 01:17:18,877
Serves you right pig!

1154
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:25,900
They are coming towards us!

1155
01:17:28,863 --> 01:17:30,117
So you wanna play games with me?

1156
01:17:30,137 --> 01:17:31,391
Is that it?

1157
01:17:36,412 --> 01:17:37,581
Don't kill us!

1158
01:17:37,601 --> 01:17:38,770
Kill each other!

1159
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,535
Curtiss pulled away from the pig!

1160
01:17:41,245 --> 01:17:42,107
Jump!

1161
01:17:42,127 --> 01:17:42,989
Jump!

1162
01:17:53,554 --> 01:17:54,160
Hey!

1163
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:54,786
Watch the money!

1164
01:18:00,227 --> 01:18:01,459
Amazing!

1165
01:18:01,479 --> 01:18:02,711
The pig's leaving a vapor trail!

1166
01:18:09,195 --> 01:18:10,973
Unbelievable!

1167
01:18:10,993 --> 01:18:12,771
I haver never seen a dogfight like this in my life!

1168
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,406
They sure are crazy!

1169
01:18:24,126 --> 01:18:25,693
The fight's gonna be over!

1170
01:18:25,713 --> 01:18:27,280
What's taking her so long?

1171
01:18:27,463 --> 01:18:28,780
I dunno.

1172
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,117
She's in her room with the door shut.

1173
01:18:30,257 --> 01:18:32,114
Boy!

1174
01:18:32,134 --> 01:18:33,991
I really don't wanna miss this fight!

1175
01:18:35,137 --> 01:18:36,707
Is she coming on not?

1176
01:18:46,434 --> 01:18:48,941
Gina, Italians know about the fighting.

1177
01:18:48,961 --> 01:18:51,468
Get the pig out of there!

1178
01:18:51,574 --> 01:18:52,813
Ferrarin.

1179
01:18:57,076 --> 01:18:57,602
Marco!

1180
01:18:57,622 --> 01:18:58,148
I hope I'm not too late!

1181
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:20,506
I cant believe that can keep this up.

1182
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:22,801
Looks like the pig's fading.

1183
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:26,979
Go on, Porco hang in there!

1184
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:32,981
You must quit!

1185
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:41,152
I'm not handing Fio over to a jerk like you!

1186
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:49,043
He's got Curtiss's edge in sight!

1187
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:50,707
It's over!

1188
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:56,481
No!

1189
01:19:56,501 --> 01:19:57,762
No!

1190
01:19:57,782 --> 01:19:59,043
Don't jam now!

1191
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,057
Gotcha!

1192
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,892
What?

1193
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,893
It can't be jammed!

1194
01:20:11,942 --> 01:20:13,487
It's not jammed.

1195
01:20:13,507 --> 01:20:15,052
You used up all your ammo, you idiot!

1196
01:20:15,696 --> 01:20:17,303
That's not good!

1197
01:20:17,323 --> 01:20:18,930
And no sucking gun and thanks to Fio's big butt!

1198
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:24,407
I refuse to end this fight with a draw!

1199
01:20:26,206 --> 01:20:27,796
You stupid cowboy!

1200
01:20:27,816 --> 01:20:29,406
There's no way you can hit me with that.

1201
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,082
Oh yeah?

1202
01:20:35,299 --> 01:20:37,265
You think you can hit me from there?

1203
01:20:37,285 --> 01:20:39,251
Cmon give me a break.

1204
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,102
You think that's funny?

1205
01:20:51,774 --> 01:20:52,775
you're not even cutting close!

1206
01:20:52,795 --> 01:20:53,796
Throw somethin' already!

1207
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:55,341
You throw like a girl!

1208
01:20:55,459 --> 01:20:56,560
You don't even know anything about girls!

1209
01:20:58,103 --> 01:20:59,150
Shut up, pig!

1210
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:02,108
What's goin' on up there?

1211
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:03,484
Cmon Porco!

1212
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:13,452
They're coming in!

1213
01:21:13,712 --> 01:21:14,667
Wait!

1214
01:21:14,687 --> 01:21:15,642
You're a bet!

1215
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:16,617
The bets can't run off, Fio.

1216
01:21:17,132 --> 01:21:18,598
I go where the money goes!

1217
01:21:18,618 --> 01:21:20,084
Wait for me!

1218
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:27,633
Why you crazy pig!

1219
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,474
Come and get it cowboy!

1220
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:38,770
Cmon put 'em up.

1221
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,980
Fight with me, you weakling!

1222
01:21:48,095 --> 01:21:49,447
No, Porco!

1223
01:21:51,834 --> 01:21:55,913
Get up, Pig You cheating!

1224
01:21:55,933 --> 01:22:00,012
Shut up!

1225
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:24,994
Cmon Porco, Block.

1226
01:22:25,014 --> 01:22:26,518
Uppercut!

1227
01:22:26,702 --> 01:22:27,130
Yeah!

1228
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:27,578
Yeah!

1229
01:22:27,598 --> 01:22:28,026
Hit 'em.

1230
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:30,018
Yes!

1231
01:22:30,038 --> 01:22:31,436
Now we got a boxing match.

1232
01:22:31,456 --> 01:22:32,854
The bets are still open!

1233
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:33,594
Taking bets!

1234
01:22:33,614 --> 01:22:34,208
Taking bets!

1235
01:22:34,228 --> 01:22:34,822
Bring a bell up here!

1236
01:22:37,887 --> 01:22:40,000
Can't you fly this plane any faster?

1237
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:42,337
Sorry maam, but I'm afraid the engine will overheat.

1238
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:45,548
Seaplane pilots are all idiots!

1239
01:22:51,727 --> 01:22:53,442
Het Fio!

1240
01:22:53,462 --> 01:22:55,177
Did you see that left hook I threw?

1241
01:22:58,683 --> 01:23:02,232
I'm gonna finish you off in the next round.

1242
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,279
This time I'm send you to dreamland Curtiss.

1243
01:23:04,386 --> 01:23:05,628
Hit him!

1244
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:06,890
Hit him!

1245
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:09,410
I'll wade a pushway you!

1246
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,239
Come on, big womanizer!

1247
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:16,371
You're the one who is a womanizer!

1248
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:20,079
You fall in love with every woman you meet!

1249
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:21,581
Your the one hoggin' in all the girls...

1250
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,420
Just pick one...Gina or Fio.

1251
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,093
What are you talkin' about?

1252
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:30,764
You gonna have one!

1253
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:34,468
Gina says hi...

1254
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:39,769
Don't say Gina like you know her!

1255
01:23:40,816 --> 01:23:44,611
Gina says she's been waitin' for ya!

1256
01:23:48,432 --> 01:23:54,281
For years now, she's been wanting to meet her in that stupid garden of hers...

1257
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:00,290
She loves you, Pig!

1258
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:08,627
Porco!

1259
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:09,753
The bell sounded the final countdown!

1260
01:24:10,988 --> 01:24:11,891
That's a knockout!

1261
01:24:11,911 --> 01:24:12,814
Stop!

1262
01:24:12,995 --> 01:24:14,595
Round is out!

1263
01:24:14,615 --> 01:24:16,215
Back to your corner.

1264
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:21,849
There they are!The Air Force hasn't arrived yet.

1265
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:36,489
End of round 6 Round 7  Gina does not want me, liar.

1266
01:24:40,294 --> 01:24:41,548
I'm not lying.

1267
01:24:41,568 --> 01:24:42,822
Why would I make that up?

1268
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:45,672
So you want Gina?

1269
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:50,173
You can't have Fio!

1270
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:52,550
That's Gina's plane!

1271
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:57,346
Hey its an emergency signal!

1272
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:13,530
1..2..3 Who ever gets up first, wins!

1273
01:25:14,494 --> 01:25:15,475
4..5 Excuse me!

1274
01:25:15,495 --> 01:25:16,476
Let me through please!

1275
01:25:18,289 --> 01:25:21,366
6..7 Gina, wait!

1276
01:25:25,005 --> 01:25:26,009
Marco.

1277
01:25:26,029 --> 01:25:27,033
Marco, getup.

1278
01:25:30,052 --> 01:25:31,534
I don't wanna see breaking anymore hearts!

1279
01:25:31,554 --> 01:25:33,036
You hear me?

1280
01:25:39,589 --> 01:25:40,895
9..

1281
01:25:40,915 --> 01:25:42,221
Yeee!

1282
01:25:42,241 --> 01:25:43,547
Porco!

1283
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,271
The winner!

1284
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,190
Porco, Thank you!

1285
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:51,902
Yeah, piece of cake.

1286
01:25:59,081 --> 01:26:00,984
Okay, listen up everybody.

1287
01:26:01,004 --> 01:26:02,907
The Italian Air Force is on its way here.

1288
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:06,810
So anyone in trouble with the Italian authority better move on out.

1289
01:26:06,979 --> 01:26:08,434
Come to the my place.

1290
01:26:08,454 --> 01:26:09,909
Drinks are on the house!

1291
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,461
Ok gang!

1292
01:26:12,481 --> 01:26:13,582
Lets squill!

1293
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:26,125
Mr.Curtiss, the fight's over.

1294
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:29,677
Hey Boss!

1295
01:26:29,697 --> 01:26:31,264
Cmon hurry up!

1296
01:26:31,405 --> 01:26:32,432
I'm trying to be classy!

1297
01:26:32,452 --> 01:26:33,479
You idiot!

1298
01:26:35,534 --> 01:26:37,727
You a great seaplane engineer.

1299
01:26:37,747 --> 01:26:39,940
Keep it up Ms.Fio.

1300
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:41,287
Bye!

1301
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:42,960
Thank you.

1302
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:44,400
And keep up the bathing!

1303
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:46,567
And I want to say thanks to you too, Mr.

1304
01:26:46,587 --> 01:26:47,944
Curtiss!

1305
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:51,298
Next time I'll propose you formally and skip the bet.

1306
01:26:51,925 --> 01:26:53,264
Ok.

1307
01:26:53,284 --> 01:26:54,623
But I already know my answer.

1308
01:26:55,303 --> 01:26:56,455
Fio!

1309
01:26:56,475 --> 01:26:57,627
You're going with Gina.

1310
01:26:57,754 --> 01:26:59,301
No!

1311
01:26:59,499 --> 01:27:01,201
I'm going with you.

1312
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:02,923
You said we are in on this together.

1313
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:08,266
Gina, take her to her respectable society please.

1314
01:27:10,444 --> 01:27:11,698
You always do this, Marco.

1315
01:27:11,718 --> 01:27:12,972
It's just not fair.

1316
01:27:15,574 --> 01:27:16,851
Sorry.

1317
01:27:16,871 --> 01:27:18,148
Off you go.

1318
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:24,448
Let's go.

1319
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:58,694
Here come the Italian Air Force.

1320
01:27:58,992 --> 01:28:00,662
I'm gonna draw them from the others.

1321
01:28:00,682 --> 01:28:02,352
You wanna help?

1322
01:28:03,705 --> 01:28:04,624
Sure.

1323
01:28:04,644 --> 01:28:05,563
Your face!

1324
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:06,772
Hey wait up!

1325
01:28:06,792 --> 01:28:07,231
Turn around!

1326
01:28:07,251 --> 01:28:07,690
Get away from me!

1327
01:28:09,026 --> 01:28:25,886
Cmon, let me see Porco flew rings around Italian Air force and they never caught up with him again.

1328
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:29,059
I stayed with Gina for a while and we became good friends.

1329
01:28:32,195 --> 01:28:34,650
But soon I decided, it was time to go back to Milan.

1330
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:39,113
Through the years there have been a few wars and a...

1331
01:28:39,223 --> 01:28:42,213
good deal of turmoil, but my friendship with Gina has remained strong.

1332
01:28:45,013 --> 01:28:48,113
I am now President of the Piccolo Co., and we are busy designing all sorts of...

1333
01:28:48,313 --> 01:28:55,112
radical new planes but I take time out every summer to visit the Hotel  Adriana.

1334
01:28:55,247 --> 01:29:00,094
The old pirate gang still hang out at Gina's Bar.

1335
01:29:02,479 --> 01:29:05,000
Mr.Curtiss does write to me sometimes, although he's yet to become...

1336
01:29:05,099 --> 01:29:12,644
the President of the United States.  And he still fondly remembers the summer in the Adriatic.

1337
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:19,777
And as for how Gina's bet turned out... well that's our secret!

1338
01:29:28,613 --> 01:33:16,054
