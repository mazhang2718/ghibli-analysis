1
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:30,326
This is the sun, this is the moon, this mountain is really the earth, and this is grandma.

2
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:54,316
My how splendid...

3
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:56,511
Hello, Mrs.

4
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:57,576
Yamada.

5
00:00:57,956 --> 00:01:01,726
I've never seen such a magnificent...

6
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:04,796
Yup, they're my little babies.

7
00:01:04,896 --> 00:01:06,386
What species?

8
00:01:06,506 --> 00:01:09,336
This is a Mino Chrysanthemum, this is...

9
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,536
No, I mean the caterpillar.

10
00:01:15,716 --> 00:01:16,976
No idea.

11
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:21,676
Grow into a butterfly just as gaudy as that flower.

12
00:01:25,256 --> 00:01:27,156
Mother!

13
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:30,626
That's our grandma.

14
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:44,566
And my mother and me, Nonoko.

15
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:48,706
What am I going to make for dinner tonight...

16
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:53,901
I know, I'll go for it!

17
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:55,736
Something really special!

18
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:57,146
What are we having?

19
00:01:57,496 --> 00:01:58,741
We had curry last week.

20
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:00,006
Curry two days ago.

21
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,276
Tonight...

22
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:02,406
Curry!!

23
00:02:02,526 --> 00:02:03,586
What...

24
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:18,366
And this is my father and my older brother.

25
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:22,066
What's the use of all this studying, Dad?

26
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:24,736
Listen, Noboru.

27
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,446
Studying is not about what's useful or not.

28
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:33,216
The studying that seems useless may turn out to be useful.

29
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:43,226
On the other hand, it might be that studying that doesn't seem not useful may not be, but then studying that seems useless may then be useful.

30
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:47,426
But when you really need it, it's not about useful or useless...

31
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:50,596
What are you going on about?

32
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:55,936
So I still have to study.

33
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:27,876
MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS I get it...

34
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:42,656
If my father had been smart and really cool, and my mother had been gorgeous and a great cook, and our family had been rich, my whole life would've been different.

35
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:48,886
If at least one of them...

36
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,366
Don't be ridiculous.

37
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:55,596
If we hadn't married, there'd be no you, and no Nonoko.

38
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:58,996
Without the two of us, you wouldn't be here.

39
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,506
No, that's wrong.

40
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:06,006
If I had cooler parents, I'd just be their kid.

41
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:07,516
How stupid.

42
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:11,416
Don't you know about stamens and pistils?

43
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:12,506
You tell him.

44
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:14,316
You can't choose your parents.

45
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:16,661
No, I can't accept that.

46
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:18,906
Something's not right.

47
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:23,196
Because I'm me, Dad's Dad and Mom's Mom.

48
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,396
What is that supposed to mean?

49
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:29,556
Who am I?

50
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:32,636
Where did I come from?

51
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:35,176
Where am I?

52
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:37,666
Who am I?

53
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:40,876
I get it...

54
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:45,786
So, there was a time when Dad and Mom weren't married.

55
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:14,716
Takashi and Matsuko are off to a great start in their new life.

56
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:17,446
Let's give them a warm send-off.

57
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:23,486
Congratulations, Takashi and Matsuko.

58
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:29,726
I also offer warm wishes to their parents and relatives.

59
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:45,976
Now, your prospects are boundless, and you're embarking for the wide open world, under billowing sails.

60
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:02,886
Life, as they say, has its ups and downs.

61
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:08,236
At times, the waves may taunt you, tossing you in their swells.

62
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,726
But take heart.

63
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:21,376
It's hard to stick with it and make it on your own, but even a couple of losers can survive most things if they're together.

64
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:30,686
So listen, take my advice and have children as soon as you can.

65
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:37,196
Children are the best reason for riding out life's storms.

66
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:54,536
Nowadays people say child-rearing is challenging and difficult, but we've done it from time immemorial.

67
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:58,006
Children grow even without parents.

68
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:01,656
So hold them close to your heart as they crawl, then walk.

69
00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:05,006
They'll be fine.

70
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:18,896
Children make you appreciate your own parents.

71
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:26,936
Parents may seem to do nothing but order you around, but they'll baby-sit your kids and sometimes give them toys.

72
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:35,736
Nowadays young people turn that saying about appreciating parents to their own advantage.

73
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:39,116
But I guess that's part of it too.

74
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:45,056
If things work out, you even get the real estate.

75
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:53,796
So Matsuko and Takashi, start looking after your folks!

76
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:57,366
I hope you know the land is in my name.

77
00:08:57,476 --> 00:09:00,876
Excuse me, mother, but I built this house.

78
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:03,376
Without land, there's no house.

79
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:08,916
And we are grateful to you, but I've worked hard, too.

80
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,716
Your room gets the best light.

81
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:13,416
Thanks for nothing.

82
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:15,526
Of course it does.

83
00:09:15,546 --> 00:09:17,536
It's on my land.

84
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:21,926
Besides, why do you always insist you built it by yourself.

85
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:25,326
I hate to contradict you, but I definitely built...

86
00:09:25,436 --> 00:09:27,666
That's enough!

87
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,236
Both of you.

88
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:31,156
That's right!

89
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:32,986
What's the point of all this bickering!

90
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,636
Listen to Noboru.

91
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:36,836
In the end, it'll all be mine.

92
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:06,196
And what should you fear most on this lifelong voyage?

93
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,076
Wild storms and rip tides?

94
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:19,221
No.

95
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:21,466
Beware the calm waters, when there's hardly a ripple in sight.

96
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:28,726
As long as a family holds each other tight, they can somehow weather the wildest seas.

97
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:31,026
But calm waters are another story.

98
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:37,596
The wind dies down, you sigh and relax, loosening your clasp.

99
00:10:38,276 --> 00:10:41,076
But take care, Matsuko and Takashi!

100
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:48,916
If in the calm you selfishly please only yourselves, you may lose each other.

101
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:57,346
You'll never see the sharks gathering around you.

102
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:06,026
And how will you guide your ship?

103
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:10,496
Without a wind, or even a course?

104
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:18,976
If you row blindly, right, no, left, no, right after all, you'll never agree.

105
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:23,906
You may even wonder why you're stuck on the same boat at all.

106
00:11:24,756 --> 00:11:27,246
Your family's about to fall apart.

107
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:29,186
Turn right there!

108
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:30,226
You sure?

109
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:31,426
Turn left!

110
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:32,546
Right, right!

111
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,576
No, left, left!

112
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:34,686
Which way!

113
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:36,356
Oh dear, maybe right.

114
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:37,986
Which is it!!??

115
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:48,676
We came so close...

116
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:49,866
Our turn!

117
00:11:50,276 --> 00:12:01,816
A Family Crisis Oh, no, this isn't the way.

118
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:03,386
You should've turned!

119
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:04,886
No, no, go straight!

120
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:07,296
No, it's that way, are you crazy?

121
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:09,026
It's this way, Dad!

122
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:10,386
Quiet!

123
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:11,556
All of you.

124
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:15,036
Nonoko's the only one who's quiet.

125
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:18,166
Hm...she's not here.

126
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:21,236
What?

127
00:12:21,746 --> 00:12:23,146
Where is she?

128
00:12:23,246 --> 00:12:25,176
Stop the car.

129
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:32,186
Where did we lose her?

130
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:35,686
Noboru, weren't you with her?

131
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:39,326
Yeah, while Dad and I were waiting for you.

132
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,396
Maybe she got bored and wandered off.

133
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,986
No, I remember her on the bench.

134
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:53,106
I'm so sorry.

135
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:57,006
What took you so long?

136
00:12:57,116 --> 00:12:59,946
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

137
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,376
I could have done some shopping, too.

138
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:05,346
I wanted to look at baseball bats.

139
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:12,956
I'm sure she's still there.

140
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:23,636
It's all because you kept yelling about how late we were.

141
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:25,341
Don't blame me.

142
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:26,956
You're the ones who were late.

143
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:32,476
You all got so excited, you just left poor Nonoko behind.

144
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:35,876
Like you weren't there yourself, grandma.

145
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:39,116
We were looking for your flannel underwear!

146
00:13:39,226 --> 00:13:40,721
The store'll close.

147
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:42,236
I'll never make it.

148
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:44,726
Stop thinking about yourself.

149
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:47,916
What if something terrible happens to Nonoko?

150
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:49,986
Something terrible?

151
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,426
You don't mean...kidnapped!

152
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:58,436
She's so adorable, just like me.

153
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:02,566
This is no time for jokes!

154
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:06,966
If only that would work now.

155
00:14:07,086 --> 00:14:08,346
What do you mean, that?

156
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:10,176
The PTA mantra.

157
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:17,686
'Don't talk to strangers.' That's what you teach children?

158
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:21,286
It's like saying all strangers are thieves.

159
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:22,621
Nonoko's fine.

160
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:23,856
Those teeth!

161
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:25,891
Hey, cake!

162
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:27,826
Gimmee some!

163
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:29,966
Just one bite.

164
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,196
OK!

165
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,666
One chomp of those teeth!

166
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:35,836
Enough!

167
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:44,046
Please move, our daughter may have been kidnapped!

168
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:49,426
We can't even call.

169
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:52,186
We should've called before.

170
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:53,856
I told you to buy a cell phone.

171
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,726
You keep quiet!

172
00:14:57,566 --> 00:15:00,726
Oh, Nonoko!

173
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,656
Are you lost?

174
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:33,496
Huh, so you're waiting for someone?

175
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:43,136
Who are you waiting for?

176
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:46,676
Can't you talk?

177
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:49,846
Then why don't you say anything?

178
00:15:50,256 --> 00:15:55,486
I'm not s'pposed to people I don't know.

179
00:15:55,796 --> 00:16:02,416
I know,'Don't talk to strangers.' You're very grown-up, because you're careful.

180
00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:09,056
You can talk now.

181
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,466
You should hear my story.

182
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:16,636
My father and mother and grandma and brother all got lost.

183
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,946
Did you lose someone?

184
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,946
My mommy.

185
00:16:22,186 --> 00:16:23,586
Your mommy?

186
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:27,686
My mommy went away...

187
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:31,986
I know...there've been a lot of missing parents lately...

188
00:16:32,596 --> 00:16:36,226
But it's only your mom, you'll find her.

189
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:45,036
Excuse me, this is Toshio Kimura.

190
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:47,236
Can you please call his mom?

191
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,336
Oh, he's lost?

192
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:50,846
No he's not, they were separated.

193
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:53,116
Right.

194
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:56,141
And your first name, Mr.

195
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:57,606
Kimura?

196
00:16:57,796 --> 00:16:58,306
- Toshio.

197
00:16:58,326 --> 00:16:58,836
- Toshio.

198
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:00,416
Toshio, then.

199
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:03,716
Wait here a minute, OK?

200
00:17:06,236 --> 00:17:07,531
And you?

201
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:08,846
Are you his sister?

202
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:10,716
No, no relation.

203
00:17:10,836 --> 00:17:13,856
My whole family's lost.

204
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:32,476
Poor little, poor little, lost pussy cat...

205
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,156
Stop crying, we're here.

206
00:18:11,836 --> 00:18:12,931
What!

207
00:18:12,951 --> 00:18:14,046
She went with her mother!?!

208
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,256
I'm her mother!

209
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:17,996
Oh, is that so?

210
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:21,156
How dare you give her to a stranger!

211
00:18:21,436 --> 00:18:24,896
It may not have been her mother, but she was no stranger.

212
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,296
No stranger?

213
00:18:26,316 --> 00:18:27,466
Who could it be?

214
00:18:27,576 --> 00:18:29,136
I don't know anyone...

215
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,676
Someone pretending to be friendly...

216
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:37,816
No, she recognized Nonoko.

217
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:38,946
That wasn't her mother!

218
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:40,141
Calm down!

219
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,236
And then?

220
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,386
I'm terribly sorry.

221
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:50,696
Nonoko went off happily with someone who seemed like her mother.

222
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:52,686
Oh no...

223
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:53,946
Who can it be...

224
00:18:54,506 --> 00:18:56,436
Will you please page Nonoko?

225
00:18:56,606 --> 00:19:00,096
Actually...they went out that exit together.

226
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,036
Not here.

227
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:02,006
Come on!

228
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,776
That's some family...

229
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:21,496
Dad, where are you racing off to?

230
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:22,756
We're chasing it!

231
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:23,556
What?

232
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,066
The car Nonoko's in!

233
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,496
What kind of car?

234
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:36,766
We don't even know which way it went!

235
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:39,181
She'll be fine.

236
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:40,726
Nonoko knew the lady, right?

237
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,876
I bet she took her home.

238
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,786
I'm sure Noboru's right.

239
00:19:46,856 --> 00:19:49,516
Sure, that must be it.

240
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:51,211
Don't be so sure.

241
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,806
You can't trust anyone these days.

242
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,156
Mother!

243
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:57,666
Don't you think you should notify the police?

244
00:19:57,766 --> 00:19:58,826
The police!

245
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,766
How would we explain?

246
00:20:01,136 --> 00:20:03,226
Make a full confession.

247
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:04,236
Confession!

248
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:09,406
That four grown people neglected and abandoned a young girl.

249
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:12,976
Say, does Nonoko have a key?

250
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:15,336
Let's go home!

251
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,176
Nonoko!

252
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:53,186
Nonoko!

253
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,676
Nonoko!

254
00:20:58,526 --> 00:20:59,546
Nonoko!

255
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,156
Not here.

256
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,136
Of course not, it was locked.

257
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:13,536
Hello.

258
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:17,776
Oh, thank goodness!

259
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,601
Thank you!

260
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:21,236
Thank you so much!

261
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,486
Thank you!

262
00:21:24,506 --> 00:21:26,336
We were looking everywhere for her.

263
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:29,016
I'm so sorry for all this...

264
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:34,696
Yes, we'll be right over.

265
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:38,196
You even made her dinner...

266
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:44,396
You're so very kind, how can we possibly thank you...

267
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:52,406
They finally got home.

268
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:55,106
They're coming right over.

269
00:21:55,216 --> 00:21:56,776
I'm sorry, auntie.

270
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,186
Oh, it's nothing.

271
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:04,186
I can't wait to hear their side of the story.

272
00:22:22,846 --> 00:23:02,446
Look up and see, the blue skies, the white clouds One of these days, it'll all work out - Next stop Luncheon Court.

273
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:15,826
What did you call this stop?

274
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:18,556
Can you stand back, ma'am?

275
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:27,696
Home Economics Wizard Oh, dear, it started raining.

276
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,116
The laundry!

277
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,346
Huh?

278
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:49,926
What's the fuss?

279
00:23:55,576 --> 00:23:56,656
That's right!

280
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:57,756
I'd already brought it in.

281
00:23:57,876 --> 00:23:59,926
You never even hung it up!

282
00:24:01,656 --> 00:24:03,251
I'm going out.

283
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:04,866
Can I get you anything?

284
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:06,386
Oh!

285
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:07,566
There was something...

286
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:10,526
What was it...

287
00:24:10,546 --> 00:24:12,676
Um...um...

288
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,516
OK, then, I'm going.

289
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:22,726
It's just that, oh, what was it...

290
00:24:34,476 --> 00:24:36,066
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

291
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:37,876
What is it!

292
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,616
Um, that is, um...

293
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,316
Why don't you just give up!

294
00:24:48,256 --> 00:24:50,016
Oh, bread!

295
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:55,566
Get it yourself!

296
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:57,886
Mom!

297
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:00,896
Money, money.

298
00:25:02,406 --> 00:25:03,696
I'm home.

299
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,936
I guess Mom's not here.

300
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:11,546
Wow, noodles.

301
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:13,906
And the water's boiling.

302
00:25:14,316 --> 00:25:17,246
Great, I'll go ahead and eat'em.

303
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:25,786
Oh, you're home.

304
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:37,566
You were hiding!

305
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:43,446
Say.

306
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:46,906
The bulb's out.

307
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:48,786
That's no good.

308
00:25:48,806 --> 00:25:50,066
Better change it.

309
00:25:51,486 --> 00:25:54,546
Oh, darn...no spares.

310
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:57,816
Just switch it with one you don't use.

311
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:01,296
Up we go.

312
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:06,356
I'm just borrowing it...

313
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:08,226

Me, too.

317
00:26:16,186 --> 00:26:18,051
I'm busy washing the dishes.

324
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:44,741
What!

325
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:45,826
Oh, no.

326
00:26:49,246 --> 00:26:51,216
Better tidy up a little.

327
00:26:56,686 --> 00:26:57,586
Ouch.

328
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:11,756
Hey, what are you doing?

329
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:14,166
I'll say we're spring cleaning!

331
00:27:31,356 --> 00:27:32,786
No, it's not.

332
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:34,361
Are you sure?

333
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:35,476
I know I left it.

334
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:37,356
It isn't here.

335
00:27:37,926 --> 00:27:39,656
Where did you look?

336
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:42,886
It's a manila envelope that says OKK in red.

337
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:45,026
Is this it, sir?

338
00:27:47,176 --> 00:27:50,291
Oh, uh...OK.

339
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:53,426
Well, if it's gone, it's gone.

Hey.

341
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:56,976

Gimme the paper.

344
00:28:01,086 --> 00:28:02,776
When I'm done.

345

346
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,486

00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,636
No, I've got it.

351
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:35,276
Lettuce, cucumber, ham, light bulbs and garbage bags, right?

352
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:36,706
I told you.

353
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:39,416
It's not exactly like I forgot.

354
00:28:41,956 --> 00:28:44,286
Lettuce...cucumber...

355
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:52,026
Let's see...

356
00:28:54,106 --> 00:28:55,266
Make up your mind.

357
00:28:55,606 --> 00:28:58,006
Have you decided?

358
00:28:58,306 --> 00:29:00,276
Just hurry up.

Oh, you're still here?

363
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,346
What do you mean,'still'?

364
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:22,226
Can't I rest on my day off?

365
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:25,226
Usually, you're off at Pachinko.

366
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:27,341
Nope, I'm giving it a rest.

367
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:29,026
How about some tea?

368
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:32,136
And noodles for lunch.

369
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:33,636
Yes, dear.

370
00:29:35,576 --> 00:29:38,736
Actually, make that coffee, not tea!

371
00:29:42,586 --> 00:29:46,016
And the bathroom's a wreck.

372
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:47,886
Clean it up.

373
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,816
And when you go shopping I need cigarettes.

374
00:29:51,926 --> 00:29:54,826
What a pain in the neck!

375
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:01,096
Honey, honey...

376
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:05,296
Where's your mother?

377
00:30:05,476 --> 00:30:07,136
Out playing Pachinko.

378
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:35,296
It's just about to start.

379
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,346
It's not over.

380
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:48,936
But I was looking forward to it.

381
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:50,146
No.

382
00:30:50,286 --> 00:30:51,776
It's a movie!

383
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:26,946
Now nobody can watch.

384
00:31:27,156 --> 00:31:29,216
This is much more fun.

385
00:31:45,176 --> 00:31:46,766
I win!

386
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:45,256
Hey, Noboru.

387
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:47,566
Wanna play catch?

388
00:32:48,706 --> 00:32:49,566
Yeah.

389
00:32:49,666 --> 00:33:01,146
Male Bonding No Trespassing Wait, the dad's supposed to be the catcher.

390
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,036
Give me a break.

391
00:33:05,786 --> 00:33:11,916
OK, this signal for a curve ball, this for a fastball, and this for a slider.

392
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:14,026
Give me a break.

393
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,156
Two outs, bases loaded, you're the relief pitcher.

394
00:33:17,266 --> 00:33:20,026
I'm the starting pitcher type.

395
00:33:20,136 --> 00:33:21,756
Give me a break!

396
00:33:21,936 --> 00:33:23,566
Are you nuts?

397
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:26,166
The team never even lets you pitch.

398
00:33:26,276 --> 00:33:29,136
That's why I want to start now.

399
00:33:30,256 --> 00:33:31,886
I see.

400
00:33:31,906 --> 00:33:33,536
OK, let's see this starting pitcher pitch.

401
00:33:34,586 --> 00:33:37,346
It's still two outs, bases loaded.

402
00:33:37,446 --> 00:33:38,546
What!

403
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:56,596
OK, pitch.

404
00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:03,346
God damn it!

405
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:09,206
What are you listening to?

406
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:15,286
Listening over and over will improve my English.

407
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:20,656
It's not that easy.

408
00:34:20,796 --> 00:34:22,486
In my experience...

409
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:23,616
Study!

410
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:25,496
Study!

411
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:29,056
Study!

412
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:51,826
It just doesn't work for me.

413
00:34:51,926 --> 00:34:53,156
I'm not you.

414
00:34:59,236 --> 00:35:01,166
How'bout a drop of sake?

415
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:01,926
Sure.

416
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:03,556
But, dear.

417
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:13,436
Pretty awful, huh?

418
00:35:16,016 --> 00:35:17,346
A little dry.

419
00:35:18,586 --> 00:35:19,576
What did you say!

420
00:35:19,716 --> 00:35:20,586
Have you been...

421
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,986
Noboru!

422
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:27,556
Noboru!

423
00:35:36,606 --> 00:35:39,436
Hey, Noboru, let's play catch.

424
00:35:41,146 --> 00:35:42,236
Why?

425
00:35:43,386 --> 00:35:45,501
Why...?

426
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:47,636
It's a form of parent-child bonding.

427
00:35:48,816 --> 00:35:51,046
Then it doesn't have to be catch.

428
00:35:51,386 --> 00:35:53,576
I get your point, but...

429
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:58,156
It's a matter of setting the right stage.

430
00:35:59,006 --> 00:35:59,996
Forget it.

431
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:01,006
Can't be bothered.

432
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:18,866
Kids these days...

433
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,816
A serious generation gap...

434
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:39,326
Paternal Supremacy Restored Don't mix your rice into the soup.

435
00:36:39,436 --> 00:36:40,986
Listen to your father.

436
00:36:41,906 --> 00:36:43,926
Pour the soup over the rice.

437
00:36:46,676 --> 00:36:48,576
Excuse me, father...

438
00:36:49,856 --> 00:36:50,566
What?

439
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:51,296
Got a problem with that?

440
00:36:52,046 --> 00:36:53,676
Oh, suit yourself.

441
00:36:59,456 --> 00:37:02,426
See, the water after the cement.

442
00:37:02,826 --> 00:37:04,846
Um...

443
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:07,656
Hmmm...

444
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:08,886
Control those chopsticks.

445
00:37:08,906 --> 00:37:10,016
It's rude.

446
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:13,956
Use your chopsticks with purpose.

447
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,456
That's my plate.

448
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:18,966
Excuse me.

449
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:22,236
You bit it, it's yours.

450
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:30,886
Help me think of an independent study topic.

451
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,446
Think for yourself.

452
00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:35,306
It's independent, free choice.

453
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:39,056
I know, but I'm coming up blank.

454
00:37:40,126 --> 00:37:42,326
You're free to do anything?

455
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,866
Right, free.

456
00:37:43,966 --> 00:37:45,156
But...

457
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:51,036
Total freedom makes it tough, doesn't it?

458
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:52,896
Exactly.

459
00:37:54,746 --> 00:37:56,236
Freedom, huh...

460
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:09,686
Absolute freedom of choice...

461
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:17,471
Glorious freedom...

462
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:19,656
I dream of freedom...

463
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:23,226
But when it comes on a silver platter...

464
00:38:28,046 --> 00:38:30,376
I haven't got a clue what to do...

465
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,976
Now he's a philosopher.

466
00:38:38,286 --> 00:38:41,486
He's probably worrying about his own retirement.

467
00:38:42,526 --> 00:38:58,826
Father as Role Model The first snow!

468
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:13,456
Let's take a picture in it!

469
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:15,776
Why?

470
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,686
You're hardly children anymore.

471
00:39:17,796 --> 00:39:18,776
Shut the door.

472
00:39:18,796 --> 00:39:19,776
It's cold.

473
00:39:46,956 --> 00:39:48,286
Where's the camera?

474
00:39:48,826 --> 00:39:51,726
In the top drawer.

475
00:39:58,166 --> 00:39:59,136
Is not!

476
00:40:03,866 --> 00:40:05,996
You should know where it is.

477
00:40:08,146 --> 00:40:10,136
This is the best part...

478
00:41:11,576 --> 00:41:35,116
A lone figure Back turned Yamada Family Chronicles Happy New Year New Year's Cards Ready!

479
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:37,056
Go!

480
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:39,056
Mine, mine, Mother's, Matsuko's, Nonoko's...

481
00:41:55,996 --> 00:41:57,156
31 seconds!

482
00:41:57,176 --> 00:41:58,336
A new record.

483
00:41:59,956 --> 00:42:01,176
Not bad.

484
00:42:05,296 --> 00:42:14,366
The Thick of Winter Time to get up.

485
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:15,956
Dad, can you get me some cake?

486
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:17,036
Coke for me.

487
00:42:17,136 --> 00:42:17,996
The tangerines, too.

488
00:42:18,106 --> 00:42:20,436
And the stove needs kerosene.

489
00:42:23,146 --> 00:42:25,546
Thank you!

490
00:42:36,786 --> 00:42:41,946
Spring Showers Can you bring my umbrella?

491
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:45,356
Your father needs his umbrella at the station.

492
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,121
Why me?

493
00:42:47,141 --> 00:42:48,616
I'm studying.

494
00:42:48,746 --> 00:42:50,456
You should go.

495
00:42:50,476 --> 00:42:52,186
Walk in the rain with your man.

496
00:42:52,306 --> 00:42:54,776
I just don't have the energy today.

497
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:55,776
But...

498
00:42:55,886 --> 00:42:57,516
Noboru!

499
00:42:57,536 --> 00:42:59,166
You go, please.

500
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:00,606
Make Nonoko go.

501
00:43:00,726 --> 00:43:01,856
Forget it!

502
00:43:01,876 --> 00:43:03,006
I'll buy one.

503
00:43:03,116 --> 00:43:05,316
Pick up some pork, too?

504
00:43:05,656 --> 00:43:06,546
No Way!

505
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:38,496
Strange...

506
00:44:38,516 --> 00:44:40,096
Where's Noboru's sock...

507
00:44:40,216 --> 00:44:43,476
Nonoko's pajamas and Dad's towel?

508
00:44:44,126 --> 00:44:44,921
Pajamas?

509
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:45,736
Socks?

510
00:44:45,856 --> 00:44:47,446
And his towel.

511
00:44:51,226 --> 00:44:52,746
Hey, wait...

512
00:44:54,556 --> 00:44:56,356
This means...

513
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,996
I knew it!

514
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:07,036
The Black Hole!

515
00:45:07,606 --> 00:45:14,006
The Perfect Combo Maybe we'll order sushi in for dinner...

516
00:45:15,396 --> 00:45:17,671
Oh, what a waste of money!

517
00:45:17,691 --> 00:45:19,966
I'll make the sushi.

518
00:45:20,356 --> 00:45:22,186
Just as I hoped...

519
00:45:26,796 --> 00:45:28,916
Say, mother...

520
00:45:29,036 --> 00:45:30,966
Sushi's not interesting.

521
00:45:30,986 --> 00:45:32,916
I thought I'd go gourmet.

522
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:37,696
I see...So what is it?

523
00:45:37,806 --> 00:45:40,636
Beef Stroganoga...

524
00:45:40,736 --> 00:45:42,906
Don't cook what you can't spell.

525
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,406
Well, excuse me!

526
00:45:46,116 --> 00:45:49,346
It's Beef Stroganoff, right?

527
00:45:49,616 --> 00:45:51,376
You knew all along.

528
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,386
I know very well.

529
00:45:53,756 --> 00:45:58,316
Beef Stroganoga is just the Strogaffgaff of beef.

530
00:45:58,426 --> 00:46:00,896
Whatever, just make it.

531
00:46:02,206 --> 00:46:03,836
Darn.

532
00:46:03,856 --> 00:46:05,486
I was really counting on sushi.

533
00:46:20,526 --> 00:46:21,759
No good.

534
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,012
I screwed it up.

535
00:46:23,032 --> 00:46:24,265
Order the sushi.

536
00:46:24,846 --> 00:46:33,356
Breakfast of Champions Wow, miso soup, fried egg and seaweed.

537
00:46:34,496 --> 00:46:36,826
A real Japanese breakfast.

538
00:46:36,926 --> 00:46:38,986
Well, actually...

539
00:46:41,636 --> 00:46:43,106
Nonoko's leftovers?

540
00:46:45,206 --> 00:46:46,226
Yesterday's soup?

541
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:49,176
Extra seaweed from lunch?

542
00:46:50,376 --> 00:46:52,036
Precisely!

543
00:46:53,216 --> 00:46:55,506
Today's your lucky day.

544
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:56,916
Hardly!

545
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:01,056
Take care.

546
00:47:03,486 --> 00:47:04,816
Matsuko...

547
00:47:13,996 --> 00:47:16,696
When's lunch, Matsuko?

548
00:47:18,616 --> 00:47:20,911
What are you talking about?

549
00:47:20,931 --> 00:47:23,226
We just ate.

550
00:47:23,706 --> 00:47:25,976
You're too young to be senile.

551
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:27,706
You sure...?

552
00:47:27,826 --> 00:47:29,786
The noodles, a few...

553
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,766
Oops!

554
00:47:35,056 --> 00:47:37,186
I ate them all myself...

555
00:47:37,286 --> 00:47:38,256
Hey!

556
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:47,366
What's for dinner?

557
00:47:47,796 --> 00:47:49,026
Shabu shabu.

558
00:47:51,266 --> 00:47:53,606
We have it all the time.

559
00:47:53,706 --> 00:47:56,266
Shabu shabu's perfect for winter.

560
00:48:00,146 --> 00:48:02,236
OK, help yourselves.

561
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,746
This way, she doesn't have to cook.

562
00:48:06,586 --> 00:48:06,616
Cold noodles for lunch again?

563
00:48:06,616 --> 00:48:09,106
Cold noodles for lunch again?

564
00:48:09,226 --> 00:48:10,986
That's what we had yesterday!

565
00:48:11,086 --> 00:48:13,386
And the day before.

566
00:48:13,496 --> 00:48:15,086
That doesn't make sense!

567
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,696
And again tomorrow!?

568
00:48:18,876 --> 00:48:20,586
Noodles!

569
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,316
What else?

570
00:48:23,236 --> 00:48:26,166
Lots of free ginger in the garden to go with it.

571
00:48:27,606 --> 00:48:34,946
Ginger Morning The ginger's good in miso soup.

572
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:39,816
Yes, though they do say it makes you forgetful.

573
00:48:40,596 --> 00:48:41,841
Oh dear.

574
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:43,106
He left his bag.

575
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:45,526
He's bound to notice.

576
00:48:45,546 --> 00:48:47,106
He can't be that dumb.

577
00:48:47,696 --> 00:48:48,526
Right.

578
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:50,186
Oh, no, I forgot...

579
00:49:00,006 --> 00:49:02,066
...to take of my pajamas!

580
00:49:06,746 --> 00:49:07,606
I'm off.

581
00:49:07,716 --> 00:49:08,776
OK.

582
00:49:11,186 --> 00:49:12,646
Have a nice day.

583
00:49:17,356 --> 00:49:18,616
I'm off.

584
00:49:21,796 --> 00:49:23,026
My shoes!

585
00:49:27,436 --> 00:49:28,796
Mom, look!

586
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:31,196
Dad!

587
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:33,236
What's all the fuss!

588
00:49:33,976 --> 00:49:34,666
My train!

589
00:49:34,776 --> 00:49:36,006
I'll be late!

590
00:49:36,746 --> 00:49:38,436
Be careful.

591
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:43,776
I'm off to school.

592
00:49:44,216 --> 00:49:46,186
Off you go...

593
00:49:47,286 --> 00:49:51,246
Can't even close the door behind them.

594
00:50:00,796 --> 00:50:02,136
What's this?

595
00:50:02,236 --> 00:50:04,996
Oh, Nonoko forgot her lunch.

596
00:50:05,106 --> 00:50:06,626
She needs it by noon?

597
00:50:06,736 --> 00:50:08,466
Sure, but...

598
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:12,366
Fine, I'll take it to her when I go shopping.

599
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,966
That'll really be a help.

600
00:50:19,856 --> 00:50:21,186
I'm off.

601
00:50:21,296 --> 00:50:22,496
OK.

602
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:23,716
Thank you.

603
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:30,486
What's this?

604
00:50:33,466 --> 00:50:36,956
Oh, no, she's forgotten her purse and everything.

605
00:50:40,576 --> 00:50:42,006
She'll be back.

606
00:50:46,816 --> 00:50:48,876
Watch the house, OK?

607
00:50:53,626 --> 00:50:55,056
Oh no!

608
00:50:55,076 --> 00:50:56,506
I left the kettle on.

609
00:51:01,236 --> 00:51:02,701
Mrs.

610
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:04,186
Yamada, delivery!

611
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:07,726
Are they out?

612
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:12,496
No, they're in.

613
00:51:13,386 --> 00:51:14,141
Oh, Mrs.

614
00:51:14,161 --> 00:51:14,916
Yamada.

615
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,206
Oh, I did turn it off.

616
00:51:22,886 --> 00:51:24,946
Were you robbed?

617
00:51:36,066 --> 00:51:37,586
Here's your package.

618
00:51:39,066 --> 00:51:40,966
Oh, thank you.

619
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:42,626
Your seal...?

620
00:51:42,736 --> 00:51:44,206
Oh, sorry.

621
00:51:44,616 --> 00:51:46,546
Let's see...

622
00:51:46,566 --> 00:51:48,496
Where do I keep it?

623
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:52,166
It's in the back of the second drawer.

624
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,106
Oh, goodness...

625
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,576
Always a pleasure.

626
00:51:57,686 --> 00:51:58,916
Thank you.

627
00:52:02,386 --> 00:52:05,086
I delivered Nonoko's lunch.

628
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:09,596
Why mother, I thought you were going shopping.

629
00:52:09,866 --> 00:52:12,596
Oops, I forgot.

630
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,236
Too much ginger...!

631
00:52:19,776 --> 00:52:38,056
Regret Say...

632
00:52:41,996 --> 00:52:43,826
Is it Mahler...

633
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:50,626
I didn't know she was a classical music fan...

634
00:53:09,556 --> 00:53:20,556
Art is Brief Life is Long They're in full bloom.

635
00:53:25,136 --> 00:53:29,336
I wonder how many more times I'll see the cherry blossoms.

636
00:53:30,256 --> 00:53:32,586
Don't be silly, mother.

637
00:53:32,606 --> 00:53:34,936
You're only 70.

638
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:38,446
Maybe 30 more...

639
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:53,493
Mom, will you go pay the taxes?

640
00:53:53,593 --> 00:53:54,823
Leave it to me.

641
00:53:57,203 --> 00:53:59,363
You hand it to the clerk, got that?

642
00:53:59,483 --> 00:54:01,008
I know.

643
00:54:01,028 --> 00:54:02,553
Don't treat me like a child.

644
00:54:07,373 --> 00:54:11,403
Oh, dear, what a terrible calamity...

645
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:14,783
I'm really going senile.

646
00:54:15,883 --> 00:54:17,253
Nice to see you.

647
00:54:17,353 --> 00:54:19,653
Take care, bye.

648
00:54:24,023 --> 00:54:26,323
I put it in the mail box!

649
00:54:32,943 --> 00:54:35,203
Why, Shige...

650
00:54:35,223 --> 00:54:37,483
Thanks for coming to visit.

651
00:54:37,773 --> 00:54:41,213
Well, I heard you were suddenly hospitalized.

652
00:54:41,413 --> 00:54:44,473
You'll never believe it...

653
00:54:44,843 --> 00:54:46,643
Have a seat.

654
00:54:54,923 --> 00:54:55,953
You see...

655
00:54:56,063 --> 00:54:57,083
Yes.

656
00:54:58,663 --> 00:54:59,723
Look.

657
00:55:00,663 --> 00:55:03,863
See the guy visiting that patient over there?

658
00:55:04,303 --> 00:55:07,763
I'm sure they're having an affair.

659
00:55:07,873 --> 00:55:09,233
What!

660
00:55:12,243 --> 00:55:13,873
Are you...?

661
00:55:14,143 --> 00:55:18,943
They definitely look suspicious to me!

662
00:55:22,423 --> 00:55:24,513
Suspicious, right?

663
00:55:29,323 --> 00:55:31,053
This is a special room.

664
00:55:31,163 --> 00:55:35,653
That notorious city councilman accused of corruption is in there now.

665
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:43,793
I occasionally come up here for a breath of fresh air.

666
00:55:50,843 --> 00:55:53,943
These noodles are pretty good, right?

667
00:55:54,883 --> 00:55:56,083
They are.

668
00:56:00,593 --> 00:56:05,493
But the coffee's really lousy here.

669
00:56:07,193 --> 00:56:11,433
By the way, why are you in the hospital?

670
00:56:18,443 --> 00:56:20,003
Oh, Shige...!

671
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:39,093
No sign of death's approach In the ciccada's voices - Basho Why, mother.

672
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:43,093
Turn on the light.

673
00:56:44,003 --> 00:56:47,763
Oh, I hadn't noticed it getting dark.

674
00:56:59,063 --> 00:57:00,803
Noboru!

675
00:57:00,823 --> 00:57:02,563
Turn off your light.

676
00:57:02,683 --> 00:57:04,013
I'm not asleep!

677
00:57:06,233 --> 00:57:10,098
Age Comes More Easily Than Wisdom Five problems left.

678
00:57:10,118 --> 00:57:13,983
I'm so sleepy.

679
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:19,223
A hot bath will wake you up.

680
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:36,423
In you go.

681
00:57:44,063 --> 00:57:44,993
Feel better?

682
00:57:45,173 --> 00:57:46,148
Yup!

683
00:57:46,168 --> 00:57:47,143
I'm wide awake.

684
00:57:50,003 --> 00:57:53,663
OK, here goes!

685
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:57,563
Here goes, here goes...

686
00:57:58,543 --> 00:58:00,163
Here...goes...

687
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:14,023
You're as limp as a noodle.

688
00:58:15,453 --> 00:58:17,723
Don't give up.

689
00:58:17,903 --> 00:58:20,318
In a fire, the first 5 minutes count.

690
00:58:20,338 --> 00:58:22,753
In a test, it's the last 5 minutes.

691
00:58:30,153 --> 00:58:32,063
Time's up.

692
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:33,993
Turn in your papers.

693
00:58:38,113 --> 00:58:39,303
Ma'm!

694
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:43,183
Tanaka felt sick and had to go to the nurse's office!

695
00:58:43,623 --> 00:58:44,713
Yes...

696
00:58:44,923 --> 00:58:47,083
We deserve make-up time!

697
00:58:48,093 --> 00:58:49,213
Forget it.

698
00:58:54,793 --> 00:58:57,233
Put them in the upstairs closet?

699
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:58,193
Sure.

700
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,193
Noboru's studying like a demon.

701
00:59:30,103 --> 00:59:33,463
But the exams are over.

702
00:59:33,573 --> 00:59:35,333
He did miserably.

703
00:59:47,113 --> 00:59:49,983
About Noboru's tutor.

704
00:59:50,483 --> 00:59:51,973
He really needs one?

705
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:54,353
He's my son, after all.

706
00:59:54,453 --> 00:59:55,853
You've got a point.

707
00:59:58,993 --> 01:00:02,793
But isn't it expensive?

708
01:00:03,203 --> 01:00:07,003
$300 for 2 sessions with a university student.

709
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,573
What!

710
01:00:09,403 --> 01:00:11,673
For $300, I'll teach him.

711
01:00:11,773 --> 01:00:14,473
I'll teach him for $200.

712
01:00:15,943 --> 01:00:18,383
Pay me $100 and I'll work harder!

713
01:00:21,553 --> 01:00:24,853
This is getting us nowhere...

714
01:00:30,523 --> 01:00:46,363
Fleeting dreams An octopus making its home in a trap A summer moon - Basho I'm home!

715
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,043
Look, chocolates!

716
01:00:57,233 --> 01:00:59,813
Mommy!

717
01:00:59,833 --> 01:01:02,413
Noboru bought chocolates!

718
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:05,283
They were a Valentine's Day present!

719
01:01:06,533 --> 01:01:10,033
Adolescence Gone!

720
01:01:10,603 --> 01:01:12,193
Gone, gone, gone!

721
01:01:12,303 --> 01:01:13,533
I'm home!

722
01:01:14,733 --> 01:01:17,203
Where are those cookies, Nonoko!

723
01:01:17,343 --> 01:01:18,393
I ate them.

724
01:01:18,613 --> 01:01:20,263
What!

725
01:01:20,283 --> 01:01:21,933
I got them for a girl!

726
01:01:22,043 --> 01:01:23,243
But...

727
01:01:23,343 --> 01:01:24,873
No ifs ands or buts!

728
01:01:25,183 --> 01:01:28,043
Mommy already ate half.

729
01:01:28,153 --> 01:01:29,643
Mother...?

730
01:01:40,233 --> 01:01:43,163
Damn...I forgot my umbrella.

731
01:01:43,463 --> 01:01:44,833
Hey, Yamada!

732
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:47,293
Use my umbrella.

733
01:01:47,673 --> 01:01:48,833
How'bout you?

734
01:01:48,933 --> 01:01:50,163
I'll be fine.

735
01:01:52,073 --> 01:01:55,173
Say, Tanaka, I forgot my umbrella!

736
01:01:55,993 --> 01:01:57,203
Too bad.

737
01:01:57,223 --> 01:01:58,433
Don't catch cold.

738
01:02:07,253 --> 01:02:08,723
Rejected.

739
01:02:10,463 --> 01:02:11,353
No!

740
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:14,383
Give it back!

741
01:02:14,493 --> 01:02:15,553
Not after that.

742
01:02:15,663 --> 01:02:16,793
But it's mine.

743
01:02:16,903 --> 01:02:17,893
Thanks for the favor.

744
01:02:18,003 --> 01:02:19,123
Give it back!

745
01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:21,433
Guess it's a rain date.

746
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:27,803
Hey, Nakamura.

747
01:02:28,013 --> 01:02:29,843
Back to sock the teacher?

748
01:02:30,123 --> 01:02:31,968
Don't be stupid.

749
01:02:31,988 --> 01:02:33,833
I came to tell him I got into college.

750
01:02:34,413 --> 01:02:36,283
Wow, you made it!

751
01:02:42,293 --> 01:02:43,313
Sir...?

752
01:02:43,423 --> 01:02:44,623
No need to run...

753
01:02:44,993 --> 01:02:46,123
from Nakamura.

754
01:02:46,243 --> 01:02:47,603
Idiot!

755
01:02:47,623 --> 01:02:48,983
Don't believe the rumors.

756
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:55,233
Hey, Yamada, Yamashita, let's buy some dirty books.

757
01:03:08,283 --> 01:03:09,213
Hey!

758
01:03:10,123 --> 01:03:10,953
Shoot!

759
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:14,283
What a coincidence.

760
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:20,348
Tragedy in Bosnia...!

761
01:03:20,368 --> 01:03:22,383
You've got serious taste.

762
01:03:22,493 --> 01:03:25,733
Well, Japan's part of a bigger world.

763
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:29,633
Can I borrow it later?

764
01:03:32,443 --> 01:03:34,173
A real tragedy...

765
01:03:37,483 --> 01:03:38,643
I'm home.

766
01:03:41,213 --> 01:03:45,053
Noboru, the textbook?

767
01:03:45,153 --> 01:03:46,053
This?

768
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:48,613
I gave you $10 for it.

769
01:03:48,893 --> 01:03:50,253
I want to see it.

770
01:04:08,073 --> 01:04:11,303
'F-1 Racing for Students' What is this!

771
01:04:12,513 --> 01:04:15,243
'Formula-1 Racing for Students'?

772
01:04:15,353 --> 01:04:18,683
It'll help my English and my geography.

773
01:04:20,553 --> 01:04:21,483
You idiot!

774
01:04:22,223 --> 01:04:27,723
You're the one who gave me 'The Power Ranger's ABC' when I was 3!

775
01:04:28,533 --> 01:04:31,793
Noboru, there's a girl on the phone.

776
01:04:31,903 --> 01:04:33,133
What!

777
01:04:39,813 --> 01:04:40,903
Oh, hello...

778
01:04:41,943 --> 01:04:43,373
Oh, yeah, it's me...

779
01:04:54,623 --> 01:04:56,283
Go away!

780
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:01,953
Oh, no, nothing.

781
01:05:03,703 --> 01:05:07,363
Yeah, yeah, OK.

782
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:12,793
A girlfriend...with his looks?

783
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:14,103
A real girlfriend?

784
01:05:14,213 --> 01:05:15,543
His face is red.

785
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:17,743
Yeah, OK.

786
01:05:18,113 --> 01:05:19,943
Bye, then.

787
01:05:32,093 --> 01:05:33,923
It's pounding away!

788
01:05:34,033 --> 01:05:35,223
An irregular heartbeat?

789
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:36,563
Let's see.

790
01:05:47,773 --> 01:05:49,263
Do you think he's upset?

791
01:05:49,373 --> 01:05:52,173
You insulted him, mother.

792
01:05:52,283 --> 01:05:55,613
This, from the paragon of motherhood?

793
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:56,343
The scent of plums On a mountain path Suddenly dawn - Basho Yamada Family Chronicles I'm home...

794
01:06:56,483 --> 01:06:58,103
Welcome back.

795
01:07:00,553 --> 01:07:10,323
An Autumn Night I'm hungry.

796
01:07:12,493 --> 01:07:13,693
Anything to eat?

797
01:07:14,293 --> 01:07:15,453
Coming right up.

798
01:07:23,203 --> 01:07:25,263
Red bean cake or banana.

799
01:07:28,573 --> 01:07:35,983
Who the hell would want to come home to bean cakes after working hard all day!

800
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:39,143
OK, a banana.

801
01:07:39,703 --> 01:07:41,583
What a jerk!

802
01:07:41,603 --> 01:07:43,483
Who wants a banana!

803
01:09:33,183 --> 01:09:39,448
Turn towards me I'm lonely too The autumn dusk - Basho Mom's down with a cold.

804
01:09:39,468 --> 01:09:45,733
We'll get take-out tonight.

805
01:09:45,843 --> 01:09:46,503
Seaweed-rice special.

806
01:09:46,613 --> 01:09:47,703
Me too!

807
01:09:47,813 --> 01:09:49,043
I'll have the salmon-rice.

808
01:09:49,883 --> 01:09:51,373
How'bout you, mother?

809
01:09:51,753 --> 01:09:53,273
The combination special.

810
01:09:55,223 --> 01:09:56,453
I'll go get it!

811
01:09:56,563 --> 01:09:58,223
Not so fast!

812
01:10:02,063 --> 01:10:04,463
Tempura-rice for me!

813
01:10:04,563 --> 01:10:11,503
Going My Way Croquet Tournament That's good.

814
01:10:13,773 --> 01:10:15,763
Hey, hey, lady...

815
01:10:17,443 --> 01:10:19,073
You can't do that!

816
01:10:19,623 --> 01:10:20,838
What?

817
01:10:20,858 --> 01:10:22,073
But this is...

818
01:10:22,963 --> 01:10:24,958
It's empty now, but someone may put a poster up.

819
01:10:24,978 --> 01:10:26,973
There's an election.

820
01:10:27,093 --> 01:10:29,213
But, mister...

821
01:10:31,863 --> 01:10:34,193
This was the only thing underneath.

822
01:10:42,003 --> 01:10:44,703
If it isn't old Saburo...

823
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:49,173
This is my territory.

824
01:10:49,413 --> 01:10:52,073
Oh, it's you, Shige.

825
01:10:52,343 --> 01:10:55,443
We might as well work together, we're volunteers.

826
01:11:00,853 --> 01:11:03,723
You're on that side, I'm on this.

827
01:11:05,193 --> 01:11:06,783
Don't cross over.

828
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:11,363
Oh, boy, she hasn't changed a bit in 60 years.

829
01:11:13,873 --> 01:11:17,233
Oh, no, I forgot to take out the garbage...

830
01:11:20,313 --> 01:11:22,363
Oh, well, I'll have to sort it!

831
01:11:22,473 --> 01:11:26,003
Why sort burnables?

832
01:11:27,213 --> 01:11:32,173
Trash can at the station, Nonoko does the park, Noboru does the store.

833
01:11:32,983 --> 01:11:34,143
You can't do that!

834
01:11:34,263 --> 01:11:35,488
Why not?

835
01:11:35,508 --> 01:11:36,733
It's a great plan.

836
01:11:37,093 --> 01:11:37,753
Off we go.

837
01:11:37,863 --> 01:11:39,383
See you later.

838
01:11:41,493 --> 01:11:42,293
Ouch!

839
01:11:42,533 --> 01:11:46,933
Here I volunteer cleaning up the park and you dump trash there!

840
01:11:47,033 --> 01:11:50,263
I'm not dumping, just using the public trash cans.

841
01:11:50,573 --> 01:11:52,203
That's the problem!

842
01:11:52,303 --> 01:11:54,303
Mom...

843
01:12:09,053 --> 01:12:12,823
The Fight for Justice Excuse us!

844
01:12:15,863 --> 01:12:17,663
Our ball fell in...

845
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:26,803
This new one or this rubber ball?

846
01:12:28,843 --> 01:12:30,333
The rubber ball!

847
01:12:40,733 --> 01:12:42,413
Honesty's the best policy.

848
01:12:42,433 --> 01:12:44,113
Don't ever lie.

849
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:45,863
OK.

850
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:48,193
Take this one too.

851
01:12:49,373 --> 01:12:50,003
Wow!

852
01:12:50,023 --> 01:12:50,653
Thanks!

853
01:12:58,553 --> 01:13:00,163
Excuse me...

854
01:13:00,183 --> 01:13:01,793
Our ball fell in yesterday...

855
01:13:01,913 --> 01:13:03,273
But you weren't here.

856
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:05,843
Didn't see any.

857
01:13:06,853 --> 01:13:08,143
I see...

858
01:13:09,453 --> 01:13:12,283
I'm sure this was the house.

859
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:22,553
I beg you, please tell those boys to give him his new ball back.

860
01:13:29,173 --> 01:13:31,333
Oh, poor things.

861
01:13:31,443 --> 01:13:35,273
You're right, they're all wilted.

862
01:13:35,883 --> 01:13:37,283
Not the flowers!

863
01:13:37,303 --> 01:13:38,703
The accident!

864
01:13:38,943 --> 01:13:40,343
Oh, I see.

865
01:13:41,013 --> 01:13:43,073
It was a motor cycle gang.

866
01:13:44,383 --> 01:13:47,283
The poor guard rail.

867
01:13:47,393 --> 01:13:48,443
Mother!

868
01:13:48,553 --> 01:13:52,683
It was the poor child's parents who suffered...

869
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:29,533
They're so loud, has to be a motorcycle gang.

870
01:14:29,893 --> 01:14:31,453
They're by the park.

871
01:14:31,933 --> 01:14:34,763
They're the litterbugs!

872
01:14:34,873 --> 01:14:36,233
I'll go scold them.

873
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:38,133
That's dangerous, mother!

874
01:14:38,243 --> 01:14:40,933
Someone was recently murdered for that.

875
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:45,533
Senior Citizen Murdered Hmm, I know.

876
01:14:54,293 --> 01:14:56,023
That's worse!

877
01:15:04,243 --> 01:15:05,788
Mm...mother!

878
01:15:05,808 --> 01:15:07,353
Why the get up?

879
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:10,403
Says she's scolding the motorcycle gang.

880
01:15:10,503 --> 01:15:12,733
Won't you stop her, please.

881
01:15:13,323 --> 01:15:16,268
You can't wear that hard-hat.

882
01:15:16,288 --> 01:15:19,233
It's a momento from when we built the house.

883
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:21,218
Oh.

884
01:15:21,238 --> 01:15:22,733
Well that's too bad.

885
01:15:22,953 --> 01:15:25,883
I'm sorry, but you can't.

886
01:15:26,283 --> 01:15:29,953
In that case, you wear it and go.

887
01:15:30,123 --> 01:15:31,613
I go!?

888
01:15:32,433 --> 01:15:34,763
They're not vicious.

889
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,113
They'll go home eventually.

890
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:40,093
Then you have nothing to fear.

891
01:15:40,213 --> 01:15:41,973
Give them a manly scolding.

892
01:15:41,993 --> 01:15:43,753
You're older.

893
01:15:44,303 --> 01:15:45,293
Manly...?

894
01:15:45,403 --> 01:15:47,173
But mother...

895
01:15:47,273 --> 01:15:49,643
I know, let's report them to 911.

896
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:51,933
The poor kids.

897
01:15:51,953 --> 01:15:54,133
They don't deserve a criminal record for making noise.

898
01:15:54,453 --> 01:15:55,673
A record!

899
01:16:12,533 --> 01:16:14,123
See, they're gone.

900
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:16,573
You think?

901
01:16:26,813 --> 01:16:28,073
What did I tell you?

902
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:33,053
We're relying on you.

903
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:39,023
All right, I'll just go look.

904
01:16:41,493 --> 01:16:43,893
Be careful, dear!

905
01:17:31,983 --> 01:17:34,073
Um, excuse me...

906
01:17:34,513 --> 01:17:35,913
What do you want?

907
01:17:36,013 --> 01:17:38,783
It's awfully late.

908
01:17:39,133 --> 01:17:39,778
Yeah?

909
01:17:39,798 --> 01:17:40,443
So what?

910
01:17:43,723 --> 01:17:45,353
Got a problem?

911
01:17:45,473 --> 01:17:47,333
N, no, we can work this out.

912
01:17:47,353 --> 01:17:49,213
I don't have a problem...

913
01:17:49,563 --> 01:17:54,623
I don't have a problem, but I do have a request.

914
01:17:54,873 --> 01:17:55,863
Spit it out.

915
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,473
Ask away, old man.

916
01:18:00,373 --> 01:18:03,103
Would you mind turning off your headlight.

917
01:18:03,343 --> 01:18:06,113
So that's your request, then?

918
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:08,083
Um, n, no.

919
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:10,173
Whaddya want then?

920
01:18:15,153 --> 01:18:21,993
Come, come fireflies, this water's bitter, this water's sweet What is that!

921
01:18:33,773 --> 01:18:35,203
That old bag's nuts.

922
01:18:35,813 --> 01:18:37,503
Mother, are you all right!?

923
01:18:41,253 --> 01:18:42,843
An old bag, huh?

924
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:45,138
At least turn down that putt-putt.

925
01:18:45,158 --> 01:18:47,203
You're a neighborhood nuisance.

926
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:49,783
M, mother, you can't talk to these low-lifes.

927
01:18:49,893 --> 01:18:51,653
Who you calling low-life!

928
01:18:51,763 --> 01:18:54,253
How exciting!

929
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:56,993
What a great voice, you have.

930
01:18:57,103 --> 01:18:58,533
Mother!

931
01:18:58,703 --> 01:19:02,363
And a fine face and physique to go with it.

932
01:19:02,473 --> 01:19:05,633
I bet people shut up when you talk.

933
01:19:05,973 --> 01:19:07,033
Get to the point!

934
01:19:07,683 --> 01:19:09,763
Really scary.

935
01:19:09,783 --> 01:19:11,863
You sure shut this guy up in a hurry.

936
01:19:11,983 --> 01:19:12,873
A cinch.

937
01:19:12,983 --> 01:19:18,313
When you yell at people, it reminds me of a snake staring down a frog.

938
01:19:20,293 --> 01:19:26,123
It sure must be fun shutting people up and ordering them around.

939
01:19:26,323 --> 01:19:27,053
It's OK.

940
01:19:27,163 --> 01:19:32,823
I know, why don't you employ your venom in the cause of justice?

941
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:34,323
What?

942
01:19:34,633 --> 01:19:38,573
Don't you like fighting for justice, that Masked Rider stuff?

943
01:19:40,343 --> 01:19:41,813
Way old, granny.

944
01:19:41,923 --> 01:19:45,903
Of course, it's not exactly cool, is it?

945
01:19:45,923 --> 01:19:49,903
Nowadays, we turn a blind eye to every kind of misdeed.

946
01:19:50,023 --> 01:19:51,958
But I know you could do it.

947
01:19:51,978 --> 01:19:53,913
Because you're fearless.

948
01:19:55,723 --> 01:20:03,453
Someone tosses a cigarette butt or can from their car, you use that voice of yours, make'em pick it up.

949
01:20:04,563 --> 01:20:11,003
You see a kid causing trouble on the subway, you gently tap him on the shoulder.

950
01:20:11,603 --> 01:20:15,133
I'm sure anyone will do whatever you say.

951
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:20,233
We'll all be so happy, we'll cheer you on.

952
01:20:23,153 --> 01:20:27,143
It's nice to be appreciated.

953
01:20:27,553 --> 01:20:34,063
While you're at it, scare off thugs, and take the bad guys' money.

954
01:20:35,533 --> 01:20:40,363
What do you say, will you heed an old bag's plea and fight for justice?

955
01:20:40,533 --> 01:20:45,233
It'll be a whole lot better than listening to me rant and rave.

956
01:20:47,443 --> 01:20:49,963
I think this old lady's nuts.

957
01:20:50,943 --> 01:20:52,673
No go?

958
01:20:52,913 --> 01:20:57,643
What a shame, with your godly attributes.

959
01:21:00,753 --> 01:21:01,743
Outta here!

960
01:21:09,393 --> 01:21:11,893
Think about fighting for justice!

961
01:21:17,643 --> 01:21:19,003
Hey, you forgot this.

962
01:21:31,123 --> 01:21:32,453
Did he get it?

963
01:21:32,553 --> 01:21:34,353
Mother!

964
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,843
Noboru!

965
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,623
Nonoko!

966
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:53,633
Mother!

967
01:22:47,633 --> 01:22:50,533
It's the Masked Rider!

968
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:32,763
The Masked Rider!

969
01:24:16,513 --> 01:24:18,683
Help...

970
01:24:28,493 --> 01:24:29,863
Mother!

971
01:24:30,493 --> 01:24:31,893
Noboru!

972
01:24:33,503 --> 01:24:35,263
Nonoko...

973
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:51,683
Thank you, Masked Rider!

974
01:25:39,733 --> 01:25:54,343
How cruel A grasshopper trapped Under a warrior's helmet - Basho I'm home.

975
01:25:54,553 --> 01:25:56,783
Did you bring your umbrella home?

976
01:25:57,693 --> 01:26:01,363
Your husband's home from work, exhausted, and all you can ask is'did you bring your umbrella home!' OK, OK.

977
01:26:01,383 --> 01:26:05,053
Welcome home.

978
01:26:05,073 --> 01:26:08,743
Have a hard day?

979
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:10,793
Where's your umbrella?

980
01:26:11,703 --> 01:26:13,063
I forgot it.

981
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:20,003
Welcome home.

982
01:26:20,103 --> 01:26:24,943
Look, I remembered to bring it home, so there, ha!

983
01:26:29,063 --> 01:26:30,528
What?

984
01:26:30,548 --> 01:26:32,013
Got a problem?

985
01:26:33,223 --> 01:26:36,953
But you didn't take an umbrella today.

986
01:26:39,063 --> 01:26:39,953
See?

987
01:26:41,093 --> 01:26:44,693
Section Chief Yamada I bought a cake.

988
01:26:44,803 --> 01:26:45,783
Really?

989
01:26:47,263 --> 01:26:49,703
Once in a blue moon...

990
01:26:50,503 --> 01:26:52,973
Guilty conscience?

991
01:26:53,073 --> 01:26:53,803
What was that!

992
01:26:53,913 --> 01:26:55,978
That's going too far.

993
01:26:55,998 --> 01:26:58,063
Here Takashi's thoughtfully gone and...

994
01:26:58,183 --> 01:26:59,773
I even bought custard.

995
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:03,813
Now that's suspicious.

996
01:27:07,563 --> 01:27:09,356
Nonoko!

997
01:27:09,376 --> 01:27:11,169
Noboru!

998
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:12,982
Your father got cake!

999
01:27:19,963 --> 01:27:21,193
Where's Dad?

1000
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:23,303
On a business trip.

1001
01:27:23,973 --> 01:27:25,403
But his briefcase...

1002
01:27:26,803 --> 01:27:29,773
Oh no, he must've forgotten it.

1003
01:27:29,913 --> 01:27:31,603
And his scarf and train pass.

1004
01:27:33,293 --> 01:27:33,818
What?

1005
01:27:33,838 --> 01:27:34,363
Oh, no!

1006
01:27:34,913 --> 01:27:37,883
He was supposed to leave early.

1007
01:27:37,983 --> 01:27:39,423
Father!

1008
01:27:40,893 --> 01:27:42,183
Dear!

1009
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:51,423
Section Chief Yamada Mom must've overslept.

1010
01:27:52,733 --> 01:27:56,723
She woke up late and thought Dad had already left.

1011
01:27:56,873 --> 01:27:58,393
Oh, I see.

1012
01:28:06,083 --> 01:28:08,313
B...b...briefcase!

1013
01:28:08,753 --> 01:28:10,373
H...h...here!

1014
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:12,013
I'm off!

1015
01:28:12,283 --> 01:28:14,253
Have a nice trip!

1016
01:28:18,223 --> 01:28:20,253
Be careful!

1017
01:28:24,303 --> 01:28:25,763
I can still make it.

1018
01:28:53,693 --> 01:28:55,253
Are you OK?

1019
01:29:07,573 --> 01:29:08,733
Phone, phone...

1020
01:29:19,723 --> 01:29:22,083
I suddenly feel terrible...

1021
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:27,923
I can hardly breathe...

1022
01:29:28,233 --> 01:29:31,223
Yes, yes, I'll get there.

1023
01:29:32,003 --> 01:29:34,163
I'll crawl there if I have to...

1024
01:29:34,633 --> 01:29:36,333
Please tell the client...

1025
01:29:36,533 --> 01:29:40,203
Yes, yes, I'm terribly sorry...

1026
01:29:45,043 --> 01:29:46,603
A slight fever.

1027
01:29:47,653 --> 01:29:48,943
You should stay home.

1028
01:29:50,183 --> 01:29:52,213
Before it gets worse.

1029
01:29:52,323 --> 01:29:55,113
The company won't take care o you.

1030
01:29:57,203 --> 01:29:58,913
You know, maybe I will.

1031
01:29:58,933 --> 01:30:00,643
Make a long weekend of it.

1032
01:30:00,763 --> 01:30:02,953
You should, you should.

1033
01:30:03,063 --> 01:30:06,593
It's good to relax and enjoy some time at home.

1034
01:30:22,913 --> 01:30:24,783
...What is it?

1035
01:30:27,123 --> 01:30:30,813
I started feeling better, the minute I decided to stay home.

1036
01:30:31,323 --> 01:30:33,883
I guess I'll go in after all.

1037
01:30:47,973 --> 01:30:49,633
Take care, dear.

1038
01:31:57,383 --> 01:31:59,113
Next, Mr.

1039
01:31:59,133 --> 01:32:00,863
Yamada will offer his congratulations.

1040
01:32:01,453 --> 01:32:03,913
Your notes, dear.

1041
01:32:10,223 --> 01:32:12,383
He's wound tight as a spring!

1042
01:32:20,113 --> 01:32:22,708
Um...

1043
01:32:22,728 --> 01:32:25,323
This is a fine, auspicious day...

1044
01:32:29,773 --> 01:32:49,093
Cucumber, garbage bags, light bulbs Life is full of surprises...

1045
01:32:54,973 --> 01:32:57,663
Now...that is, up until now...

1046
01:32:58,403 --> 01:33:01,203
things seemed to be just fine...

1047
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:05,703
then suddenly, you're shoved off a cliff!

1048
01:33:05,883 --> 01:33:12,213
By...your trusted spouse, of all people!

1049
01:33:13,283 --> 01:33:14,723
He means you.

1050
01:33:16,593 --> 01:33:19,923
But Ichiro and Kazuko...

1051
01:33:20,293 --> 01:33:24,623
You have to accept life as it comes.

1052
01:33:27,263 --> 01:33:36,503
Acceptance is the key to surviving the worst situations, without losing heart or breaking up.

1053
01:33:36,913 --> 01:33:38,773
Breaking up?!

1054
01:33:40,843 --> 01:33:42,873
Even the worst behavior...

1055
01:33:43,413 --> 01:33:48,373
can be accepted and forgiven if there is no malice.

1056
01:33:48,493 --> 01:33:51,513
In fact, must be forgiven so one can go on with life!

1057
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:54,013
Gutsy speech!

1058
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:59,763
It's not necessarily bad to resign yourself to a situation.

1059
01:33:59,963 --> 01:34:02,263
In fact, it's essential.

1060
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:05,363
A must for a happy family.

1061
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:08,673
A must for facing life and getting on with it.

1062
01:34:10,443 --> 01:34:22,683
Though it may sound negative, 'acceptance' is the only way out of totally unacceptable situations.

1063
01:34:25,673 --> 01:34:27,868
I didn't know he had it in him...

1064
01:34:27,888 --> 01:34:30,083
What a man.

1065
01:34:38,103 --> 01:34:41,763
Um, well, that is, I mean.

1066
01:34:45,843 --> 01:34:52,273
So, my dear Ichiro and Kazuko, congratulations on your wedding.

1067
01:34:53,823 --> 01:34:59,783
May you be a tough, harmonious couple.

1068
01:35:10,503 --> 01:35:18,473
When I grew up and fell in love I asked my sweetheart, what lies ahead?

1069
01:35:19,823 --> 01:35:32,483
Will we have rainbows day after day?

1070
01:35:32,503 --> 01:35:45,163
Here's what my sweetheart said Que sera sera, whatever will be, will be the future's not ours to see qu
