1
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:20,853
Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu and Studio Ghibli present In ancient times the land lay covered in forest.

2
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:27,901
Here dwelt the spirits of nature from time immemorial.

3
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:31,298
PRINCESS MONONOKE Yakul!

4
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,055
Ashitaka!

5
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,683
Oracle says to get back to the village.

6
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,143
The Old Man, too.

7
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,365
- Something's wrong.

8
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:46,470
- The birds are gone.

9
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,564
The animals too.

10
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:49,932
I'll go to him.

11
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:51,850
You'd better go now.

12
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,358
Something's coming.

13
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:40,149
- What is it?

14
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:41,275
- Don't know.

15
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:42,401
It's not human.

16
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,706
Oracle summoned everyone back to the village.

17
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,125
There!

18
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,698
A demon god!

19
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,970
Yakul, run!

20
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,790
It'll attack the village!

21
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,125
Ashitaka!

22
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:14,118
Don't touch it!

23
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:15,619
Its curse will be on you!

24
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,673
Yakul!

25
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,781
Quiet your rage, I beg you!

26
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,661
O forest god who cannot be without name, why do you rampage so?

27
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:05,627
- A monster!

28
00:05:05,647 --> 00:05:06,502
- Run!

29
00:05:08,568 --> 00:05:09,965
Stop!

30
00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:11,382
Leave our village in peace!

31
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:12,739
Stop!

32
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,594
Still your rage!

33
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,151
Get up!

34
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:15,989
- It's down!

35
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,031
- Ashitaka!

36
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,293
Bring Oracle!

37
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,795
Stoke the fire!

38
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,547
Ashitaka.

39
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,105
Don't touch it.

40
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,460
It's no ordinary wound.

41
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,087
He's hurt!

42
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:31,505
Where's Oracle?

43
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,559
All of you, stay back!

44
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:35,977
Oracle!

45
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,648
Pour this water on it, slowly.

46
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,957
O raging god unknown to us...

47
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,001
...I bow before you.

48
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:05,424
Where you have fallen, we will raise a mound and perform rites.

49
00:07:05,643 --> 00:07:07,061
Bear us no hate.

50
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:08,499
Be at peace.

51
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,098
Hear me, loathsome humans!

52
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,978
You shall know my agony and my hatred.

53
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,479
This is very, very bad.

54
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,524
The boar-spirit came from far to the west.

55
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,778
A poison within him goaded him on, rotting his flesh...

56
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:14,951
...drawing evil as he ran, making a demon of him.

57
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,454
Prince Ashitaka...

58
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,124
show us your right arm.

59
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,759
Oracle!

60
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:37,057
Ashitaka, are you ready to face your destiny?

61
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:39,028
Yes.

62
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:40,800
I was resolved when I let my arrow fly.

63
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:47,317
The poison will seep into your bones and you will die.

64
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,157
Can nothing be done?!

65
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,536
He fought for the women and the village!

66
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,955
To simply wait for death...

67
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,083
We cannot change our fate.

68
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,087
But we can rise to meet it.

69
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,922
Look.

70
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,469
This was deep in the boar's body.

71
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,806
His suffering was terrible.

72
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,017
The iron shattered his bones and tore his entrails.

73
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,853
What else could have made him that way?

74
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,817
Something sinister waits in the lands to the west.

75
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,155
If you journey there and search for evil with eyes unclouded...

76
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,285
you might find a way to lift the curse.

77
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,248
More than 500 years have passed...

78
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:47,377
since the Emperor drove us into this land.

79
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:51,089
Now we hear how his power fades...

80
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,676
and the fangs of his Shoguns are broken.

81
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:59,681
But the blood of our tribe likewise grows thin.

82
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:08,815
And now, bitter fate... the youth who was one day to lead us must journey far to the west.

83
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:26,740
The Law forbids us to watch you go.

84
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,992
Farewell.

85
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,837
- Ashitaka.

86
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:02,484
- Kaya, you can't be here.

87
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:04,987
I don't care.

88
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:06,989
Remember me with this.

89
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,713
Your jewel dagger.

90
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,508
It will protect you.

91
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:19,084
You'll always be in my heart.

92
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:21,461
Always, without fail.

93
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,724
And you in mine, Kaya.

94
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,732
Fighting?

95
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,366
Head them off!

96
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,163
There's one, get him!

97
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,248
His head is mine!

98
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,052
Stop!

99
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,853
My arm!

100
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,607
Don't let him get away.

101
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:39,099
Stay back.

102
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,183
Let me pass!

103
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,626
A demon!

104
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,808
The mark is getting darker.

105
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,822
This gruel tastes like hot water.

106
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,828
There he is!

107
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,586
Is this enough?

108
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,005
This isn't money.

109
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,382
Give me back my rice!

110
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,427
Here, let me take a look.

111
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,892
Woman, this is pure gold!

112
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,187
If it's coins you want, I'll pay you.

113
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,647
Give me this.

114
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:04,027
Listen, is there a money-changer here?

115
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,945
No?

116
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:11,701
I'm a simple priest, but I'd say this is worth three sacks of rice.

117
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,119
Hey, wait!

118
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,163
That's mine, give it back!

119
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:19,417
Wait, don't be in such a hurry.

120
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:22,848
No need to thank me.

121
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:25,537
It is I who should thank you.

122
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:30,178
I saw how you dealt with those samurai.

123
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,891
You fight like one possessed.

124
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:40,324
You see them too?

125
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:42,346
Keep your gold hidden.

126
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,110
Hearts have grown hard throughout the land.

127
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:48,353
They'll rob you in your sleep.

128
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:49,729
Shall we run?

129
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,379
So the boar became a demon...

130
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:09,842
I followed its tracks, but lost them in the village.

131
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,344
I'm not surprised.

132
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,054
Look around you.

133
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:19,060
This used to be a fine village.

134
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:21,866
There was a flood, maybe, or a landslide.

135
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:24,347
I'm sure many died.

136
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,487
The land teems with bitter ghosts...

137
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:33,950
...dead from war, sick or starved and fallen where they stood.

138
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:36,193
A curse, you say?

139
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:38,195
This world is a curse.

140
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,709
Ah, this is good!

141
00:16:44,388 --> 00:16:46,265
I shouldn't have gotten into that fight.

142
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:48,162
I killed two men.

143
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,758
You helped me escape.

144
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:52,396
Give me your bowl.

145
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,709
You need food.

146
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,513
Everyone dies.

147
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,016
Some now, some later.

148
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,393
Hmm, an elegant bowl.

149
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:05,523
You remind me of the Emishi of old.

150
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,651
A brave people far to the east...

151
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,780
who used stone arrowheads and rode red elk.

152
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:22,165
The trick is to avoid the jaws of death.

153
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,668
Or so my master used to say.

154
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:27,181
Eat, my boy.

155
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:28,453
It's your rice.

156
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,633
Look at this.

157
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,139
What is it?

158
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,725
It was in the body of the giant boar.

159
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,978
This is what killed him.

160
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,075
Far to the west, deep in the mountains...

161
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:01,120
is a forest where none may tread.

162
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,841
- The forest of the Deer God.

163
00:18:02,861 --> 00:18:04,321
- The Deer God?

164
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,170
They say the beasts there are giants, as in ages past.

165
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,498
I knew he'd go...

166
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,522
It's not far now.

167
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,189
Stay on your guard.

168
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,536
They're coming.

169
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,037
The wolves!

170
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:33,690
Calm the oxen.

171
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,802
Don't rush.

172
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:35,914
Form ranks.

173
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,176
Keep your powder dry!

174
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,678
Wait until they're close.

175
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,062
Number One, fire!

176
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,749
Number Two, fire!

177
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,716
That was too easy.

178
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:20,563
Those were just the pups.

179
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,210
Where's the mother?

180
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,353
It's Moro.

181
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,277
Come on, Moro!

182
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,209
Got her!

183
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:55,055
She's immortal.

184
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:56,785
She won't die from that.

185
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,305
She did some real damage.

186
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,890
Let's get going.

187
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,767
What about those who fell?

188
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,560
Form ranks and move out.

189
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,999
He's breathing.

190
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,251
Hang on!

191
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:39,347
My name is Ashitaka!

192
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:41,307
I come from the east.

193
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,571
Are you ancient gods from the forest of the Deer God?

194
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,172
Leave!

195
00:23:23,286 --> 00:23:24,684
A kodama?

196
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:26,102
Are they here, too?

197
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,605
Don't move.

198
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:30,980
You're hurt.

199
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:38,009
They won't harm you.

200
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:39,864
They're a sign the woods are healthy.

201
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,253
They'll bring the Deer God.

202
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:43,516
The Deer God?

203
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:44,621
The giant wolf?

204
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:46,831
No, far bigger.

205
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:48,791
The mother of all beasts.

206
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,430
It's gone!

207
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,095
Yakul's not afraid.

208
00:24:00,115 --> 00:24:01,930
There's no danger here.

209
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,194
Please let us pass through your woods.

210
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:20,427
Let's go back.

211
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:21,365
Please!

212
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:24,244
There's a trail across the river.

213
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:26,455
We'll never get through these woods.

214
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,008
The current's too strong to cross.

215
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,970
If we don't get help soon, this man will die.

216
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,770
Are you guiding us or getting us lost?

217
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:00,206
Sir, these sprites aren't helping us.

218
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,333
There are more of them!

219
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,032
What a magnificent tree.

220
00:25:24,052 --> 00:25:25,804
Is she your mother?

221
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,777
That girl and the wolves... so this is where they live...

222
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:14,562
We're getting in deeper, sir.

223
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:16,855
This way leads into the other world.

224
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,285
Yes, let's take a rest.

225
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,131
Footprints.

226
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,600
Three toes... still fresh.

227
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,821
What's wrong, sir?

228
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:13,181
Are you all right?

229
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:15,141
You're awfully pale.

230
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,736
I told you!

231
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,947
Did you see something?

232
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,699
No, forget it.

233
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,869
Hang on a little longer.

234
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,579
I'm sorry.

235
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,004
It's gone.

236
00:28:38,268 --> 00:28:40,103
What is this?

237
00:28:40,123 --> 00:28:41,958
I feel much stronger.

238
00:28:42,313 --> 00:28:43,523
Hey!

239
00:28:43,543 --> 00:28:44,753
It doesn't hurt.

240
00:28:46,276 --> 00:28:47,506
I'm cured!

241
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:48,756
No, it's broken.

242
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,578
Sir, you're a genius.

243
00:28:56,598 --> 00:28:58,809
We're back at the ironworks!

244
00:29:30,987 --> 00:29:32,655
- It's a castle.

245
00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:34,343
- Lady Eboshi's ironworks.

246
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,483
They melt sand into iron.

247
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:42,154
Hey!

248
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,939
- Someone's coming from the woods!

249
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,398
- A monster?

250
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,829
It's me, Koroku the ox-driver!

251
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,669
It's true, he's crossing the lake!

252
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:01,267
What's all this noise?

253
00:30:01,287 --> 00:30:03,289
Be quiet when I'm writing.

254
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,345
Koroku's back from the dead!

255
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,596
What?

256
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,318
You're not a ghost.

257
00:30:21,454 --> 00:30:22,894
- Where are the others?

258
00:30:22,914 --> 00:30:24,354
- There were two more.

259
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,615
Only we were saved.

260
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,037
The guards never get killed.

261
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,664
Step aside.

262
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,376
Who's the man in the hood, sir?

263
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,253
An outsider.

264
00:30:40,682 --> 00:30:43,330
Riflemen, listen!

265
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,998
This gentleman carried us all the way here.

266
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,095
Show some gratitude.

267
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:50,129
Ouch!

268
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:51,630
Don't grab me there.

269
00:30:53,611 --> 00:30:54,863
You!

270
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:56,135
Wait there!

271
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,909
First, I thank you for helping our men.

272
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,078
But something bothers me.

273
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,915
You got here in less than half the time we did...

274
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,210
...through the Deer God's forest, carrying two...

275
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:21,535
Koroku!

276
00:31:21,555 --> 00:31:22,744
You're alive!

277
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,298
Toki!

278
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:30,002
You fool!

279
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:31,837
How can you drive oxen with that broken leg?

280
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,098
But...

281
00:31:33,276 --> 00:31:35,278
Scaring me half to death!

282
00:31:35,298 --> 00:31:37,300
The wolves should've eaten you.

283
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,479
Then I could find a better man.

284
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,566
Don't be so hard on me, Toki.

285
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,527
Toki, take your lovers' quarrel elsewhere.

286
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,072
And you, leaving them to die!

287
00:31:49,584 --> 00:31:51,169
Some guard you are.

288
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:52,774
You don't lift a finger around here.

289
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,870
When there's trouble, do something!

290
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,914
It couldn't be helped...

291
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,802
Thank you.

292
00:31:58,822 --> 00:32:00,574
My husband's an idiot, but I'm glad he's safe.

293
00:32:01,012 --> 00:32:02,869
Good.

294
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:04,746
I was afraid maybe I'd done something wrong.

295
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,752
You seem very handsome.

296
00:32:10,772 --> 00:32:12,754
Show us your face.

297
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,847
Gonza.

298
00:32:15,193 --> 00:32:17,133
I would like to thank the traveler.

299
00:32:17,153 --> 00:32:19,093
Bring him to me later.

300
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,479
Koroku.

301
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:23,347
It's good you're back.

302
00:32:23,367 --> 00:32:24,848
I apologize.

303
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:28,394
Don't say that, Lady Eboshi.

304
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,479
He'll just take advantage of you.

305
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:33,294
Forgive me, Toki.

306
00:32:33,314 --> 00:32:35,483
I shouldn't have let it happen.

307
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,163
My lady, if you hadn't been there...

308
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,500
they'd all be cavorting inside the wolves by now.

309
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,922
Traveler, please stop and rest.

310
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:53,085
Hey!

311
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:54,252
You are handsome!

312
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,918
We had to fight off Moro to bring this rice, you know.

313
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,545
Dish it out!

314
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,715
Where?

315
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,299
Is that him?

316
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,844
Toki was right!

317
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,107
- He is handsome!

318
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:36,254
- A bit young.

319
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,807
That never stopped you before.

320
00:33:39,527 --> 00:33:40,612
Quiet out there.

321
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:41,717
We lost two men.

322
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,104
There are plenty of handsome men here.

323
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,106
Cowherds!

324
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:48,745
Come to our place, traveler!

325
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:51,268
Forget this stinking barn.

326
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:53,771
Watch your mouth!

327
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,981
We risked our lives for the rice you're eating.

328
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:59,119
Who made the iron that bought the rice?

329
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,747
We work those bellows all night long.

330
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,625
I'd like to see where you work, if you don't mind.

331
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:06,543
Really?

332
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,920
We'll have to work in makeup.

333
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,756
Even rouge!

334
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,843
Don't forget, we'll be waiting.

335
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,680
Don't mind them, sir.

336
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,601
Lady Eboshi spoils them.

337
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,103
A good village has happy women.

338
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,607
But women working the bellows in an ironworks?

339
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,860
Their presence defiles the iron.

340
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:36,364
When she finds girls sold as slaves, Eboshi buys their freedom.

341
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,492
She's kind, that's all.

342
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,535
There's rice on your face, old man.

343
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:44,664
But she's not afraid of ancient laws, or of curses.

344
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,667
Or of wolves, either.

345
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,712
You should've seen her fighting Nago!

346
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:51,797
Nago?

347
00:34:51,974 --> 00:34:53,914
A huge boar-god.

348
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:55,874
He ruled the forest around here.

349
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,637
We couldn't go into the mountains.

350
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:02,265
All we could do was look up at them.

351
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,144
We used up the iron in the sand by the lake.

352
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:08,908
Many people had their eye on this place.

353
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,180
The boars got them all.

354
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:15,153
To get sand, we have to clear the trees.

355
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,447
Nago went wild.

356
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,591
There they go again!

357
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,888
Then Lady Eboshi came along with her muskets.

358
00:36:09,051 --> 00:36:10,011
Sir?

359
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:10,991
What's wrong?

360
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,131
Does your arm hurt?

361
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,384
I was thinking about that boar.

362
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,180
He must have died full of hate.

363
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,147
I'm sorry I kept you waiting, Ashitaka.

364
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,607
That's good iron.

365
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,735
We had to make tomorrow's shipment.

366
00:36:39,457 --> 00:36:40,771
Let's rest now.

367
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:42,105
Tell the others.

368
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:47,329
Some think you're spying for the samurai, or the monsters.

369
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,916
There are many who covet our iron.

370
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,585
May I ask why you're here?

371
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,927
You must recognize this.

372
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:07,933
It shattered the bones of a giant boar, rotted his flesh and made him a monster.

373
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:13,438
When I tried to stop him, I was left with this scar, a curse unto death.

374
00:37:13,908 --> 00:37:15,660
Where is your land?

375
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,432
I've never seen an elk like yours.

376
00:37:18,162 --> 00:37:19,852
Between north and east.

377
00:37:19,872 --> 00:37:21,562
That's all I will say.

378
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:23,564
Why, you!

379
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,441
Answer her or I'll cut you in two!

380
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,787
And when you find the one who made that?

381
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,666
I will see with eyes unclouded, and decide.

382
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,168
Eyes unclouded?

383
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,508
I see.

384
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:42,833
I'll show you my secret.

385
00:37:42,853 --> 00:37:44,042
Come.

386
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,303
Lady Eboshi!

387
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,222
Take over, Gonza.

388
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,369
No one dares enter this garden.

389
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,039
Come, if you would know my secret.

390
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,673
We're coming in.

391
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,558
We just finished.

392
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,478
It's still heavy.

393
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,356
It's light in your hands.

394
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,359
If the barrel's too thin, it will burst.

395
00:39:22,745 --> 00:39:24,893
It's not just for me.

396
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,061
The women will be using them.

397
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,574
Won't that be a sight!

398
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,328
This is the new musket these people have designed.

399
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,705
Chinese muskets are too heavy.

400
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,709
This will kill monsters and pierce samurai armor.

401
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:42,098
Watch out.

402
00:39:42,118 --> 00:39:44,079
Lady Eboshi wants to rule the country.

403
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,415
I'm sorry to rush you.

404
00:39:46,435 --> 00:39:48,000
I'll send sake later.

405
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,844
Won't that be nice!

406
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:55,183
You stole the boar's woods and made a monster of him.

407
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,853
Will you breed new hatred and evil with those weapons?

408
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,815
I'm sorry you suffer.

409
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,776
The musket ball you found is mine.

410
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,863
That hapless boar should have cursed me instead.

411
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,592
Your right hand wants to kill me?

412
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,470
Perhaps that would lift this curse.

413
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,140
But my hand would not be stayed.

414
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,268
Must it kill us all to find peace?

415
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,772
My lady, Osa wants to say something.

416
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:48,361
Lady Eboshi, do not scorn the young man's strength.

417
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:53,158
Young man, I too am cursed.

418
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,911
I understand your rage and grief...

419
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:01,207
but I beg you not to kill our lady.

420
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:07,964
She is the only person who ever treated us as human.

421
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,217
She did not fear our disease.

422
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:15,847
She washed and bandaged our flesh.

423
00:41:19,028 --> 00:41:21,468
- Osa...

424
00:41:21,488 --> 00:41:23,928
- Life is suffering and pain.

425
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:28,526
This world and its people are cursed, but we still wish to live.

426
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,446
Forgive my foolish babbling.

427
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,425
They're back.

428
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:58,097
They come at night to plant trees and take back the mountain.

429
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,601
Ashitaka, will you stay, and work with me?

430
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,854
Would you seize even the Deer God's forest?

431
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:09,192
Without the ancient gods, the wild ones are mere beasts.

432
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:14,989
With the forest and wolves gone, this will be a land of riches.

433
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,575
Even Princess Mononoke will be human again.

434
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,244
Princess Mononoke?

435
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,914
The wild girl whose soul the wolves stole.

436
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,625
She lives to kill me.

437
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:34,467
The blood of the Deer God is said to cure disease.

438
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:40,265
Perhaps it could cure these people, even lift your curse.

439
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,849
Lady Eboshi!

440
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,269
How does it handle?

441
00:42:44,697 --> 00:42:46,303
Very well made.

442
00:42:46,323 --> 00:42:47,929
Perfect for conquering the country.

443
00:42:48,075 --> 00:42:49,910
- But still a bit heavy.

444
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,765
- Hard to please.

445
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,847
Look who's here!

446
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,474
Toki, let me try the bellows.

447
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,143
Wait!

448
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,355
May I try?

449
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,817
Let him see what it's like.

450
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,993
What strength!

451
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,206
You really came!

452
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,334
I told you he's an handsome man.

453
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,128
Look, she's fixing her kimono!

454
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,049
You'll never keep up that pace, traveler.

455
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,426
It's hard work.

456
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,179
Yes, we work four days straight.

457
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,806
Is life hard here?

458
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:08,353
Yes, but it's better than in the towns.

459
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:12,315
We eat our fill and the men know their place.

460
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,900
I see.

461
00:44:59,581 --> 00:45:00,812
- You're leaving tomorrow?

462
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:02,063
- You should stay longer.

463
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,741
You can help us.

464
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:07,120
Thank you, but there is someone I must meet.

465
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,086
She's here.

466
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,051
Princess Mononoke!

467
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,090
It's her!

468
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:02,800
Stop!

469
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,428
I don't want to fight you!

470
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,685
She's after the Lady!

471
00:46:23,373 --> 00:46:25,521
Stoke the fires.

472
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:27,689
Riflemen, keep her inside!

473
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,037
Steady at your posts!

474
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,331
She's up on the roof.

475
00:46:33,842 --> 00:46:35,114
Don't get excited.

476
00:46:35,134 --> 00:46:36,406
Keep working.

477
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,544
We must keep the fire going.

478
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:40,620
- Is she alone?

479
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,829
- Yes.

480
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:43,038
We have her cornered.

481
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,343
She came for you.

482
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,720
All right, let's go.

483
00:46:56,782 --> 00:46:58,680
Can you hear me, Princess Mononoke?

484
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,598
Here I am.

485
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,278
You wish to avenge your tribe.

486
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,991
There are some here who seek vengeance for husbands...

487
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,244
killed by your wolves.

488
00:47:11,505 --> 00:47:12,777
Come out!

489
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:14,069
We have scores to settle!

490
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,466
There she is!

491
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,761
Surrender, Princess Mononoke!

492
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,973
Stay out of the line of fire!

493
00:47:38,907 --> 00:47:39,825
It's a trap.

494
00:47:39,845 --> 00:47:40,763
Stop!

495
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:45,903
Wolf princess, go back to your woods!

496
00:47:49,376 --> 00:47:50,794
Don't die for nothing.

497
00:47:50,814 --> 00:47:52,232
Go back!

498
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,078
I knew it!

499
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,205
Let him do as he likes.

500
00:48:17,404 --> 00:48:18,322
Got her!

501
00:48:18,342 --> 00:48:19,260
She's falling.

502
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,771
Don't move.

503
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,191
A wolf's severed head can still bite.

504
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,945
Aim where she falls.

505
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,007
Fire!

506
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,476
Stay back!

507
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,319
Wake up!

508
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,451
No!

509
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,721
Get her!

510
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:37,640
Don't let her go.

511
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,100
Kill her!

512
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,106
Are you all right, sir?

513
00:49:54,376 --> 00:49:55,356
Don't worry about me.

514
00:49:55,376 --> 00:49:56,356
Go!

515
00:50:02,592 --> 00:50:04,157
Villain!

516
00:50:04,177 --> 00:50:05,742
You're one of them too.

517
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,505
Halt!

518
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,927
Step aside.

519
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,946
What are you doing, Ashitaka?

520
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,073
Her life is mine.

521
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,036
Will you marry the wolf princess?

522
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,986
There is a demon inside you.

523
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:43,612
And in her.

524
00:50:49,264 --> 00:50:51,412
Look!

525
00:50:51,432 --> 00:50:53,580
This is the hatred and bitterness that curses me!

526
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:57,094
It rots my flesh and summons my death.

527
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,097
You cannot yield to it.

528
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,017
Enough talk of your curse.

529
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,935
I'll cut that arm off!

530
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,400
Lady Eboshi!

531
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,197
Someone help me.

532
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,402
Don't worry.

533
00:51:23,422 --> 00:51:24,694
She'll recover.

534
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,129
I will take the girl!

535
00:51:32,808 --> 00:51:34,455
Wait!

536
00:51:34,475 --> 00:51:36,122
You hurt Lady Eboshi!

537
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,513
Don't move!

538
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,526
Kiyo, no!

539
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,075
He still lives...

540
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:08,572
- And Lady Eboshi?

541
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:09,739
- Safe, sir.

542
00:52:10,095 --> 00:52:11,993
Bring me my musket.

543
00:52:12,013 --> 00:52:13,911
Sharpshooters, fall in!

544
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,006
They won't get away.

545
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,717
Toki, quick!

546
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,891
You're...

547
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,700
Sir, you may not pass.

548
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,703
The gate may not be opened without orders.

549
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,708
Please turn back.

550
00:52:50,844 --> 00:52:52,596
You helped us.

551
00:52:52,616 --> 00:52:54,368
We don't want to harm you.

552
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:59,508
I will leave as I came, of my own will.

553
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,013
No... it takes ten men to open that gate.

554
00:53:12,449 --> 00:53:13,221
Sir, no!

555
00:53:13,241 --> 00:53:14,013
You'll die!

556
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,783
It's moving...

557
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,459
Out of the way!

558
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,380
Wolves!

559
00:53:38,808 --> 00:53:39,393
Flint!

560
00:53:39,413 --> 00:53:39,998
Flint!

561
00:53:40,352 --> 00:53:41,604
Stop.

562
00:53:41,624 --> 00:53:42,876
Your princess is safe!

563
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,097
We're coming.

564
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,515
Yakul, let's go.

565
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,855
Thank you.

566
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,489
He's gone.

567
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,429
Wait!

568
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,891
He's mine.

569
00:54:42,539 --> 00:54:44,332
Did they shoot you?

570
00:54:44,352 --> 00:54:46,145
Are you going to die?

571
00:54:49,921 --> 00:54:51,611
Why did you stop me?

572
00:54:51,631 --> 00:54:53,321
Speak while you still live!

573
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,835
I didn't want you to die.

574
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:02,089
I'm not afraid to die if it will drive away the humans!

575
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,592
I knew that when I first saw you.

576
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,679
You've wasted your life by getting in my way!

577
00:55:12,944 --> 00:55:14,634
I'll cut your throat!

578
00:55:14,654 --> 00:55:16,344
That'll shut you up.

579
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,856
Live...

580
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,483
I don't listen to humans!

581
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,987
You're beautiful...

582
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,109
What's wrong, San?

583
00:55:31,129 --> 00:55:33,028
Shall I tear him apart?

584
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,216
It's the apes.

585
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,647
Apes!

586
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:51,794
Do you insult the tribe of Moro?

587
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,059
This forest ours.

588
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,269
Give us man.

589
00:55:57,395 --> 00:56:00,773
Give us man and go.

590
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,400
Be gone before my fangs find you.

591
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,361
Go.

592
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,613
We eat man.

593
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,406
We eat him.

594
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,533
Let us eat man.

595
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:15,621
Why would the tribe of the apes...

596
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,123
...want to eat a man?

597
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:20,950
We eat man.

598
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:23,077
We get his strength.

599
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:26,924
We get strength to drive humans away.

600
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:31,095
You won't get that power by eating a man.

601
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:35,557
All that will do is defile you and turn you into something else!

602
00:56:35,985 --> 00:56:38,008
We plant trees.

603
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:40,051
Humans kill them.

604
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,701
Forest not come back.

605
00:56:42,721 --> 00:56:45,182
We kill humans.

606
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:46,990
The Deer God is with us.

607
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,297
Don't give up.

608
00:56:48,317 --> 00:56:49,604
Plant your trees.

609
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,199
Moro's tribe is fighting for you!

610
00:56:52,669 --> 00:56:54,609
Deer God not fight.

611
00:56:54,629 --> 00:56:56,569
We die.

612
00:56:56,714 --> 00:56:58,446
Wolf girl not care.

613
00:56:58,466 --> 00:57:00,198
Wolf girl human.

614
00:57:01,761 --> 00:57:03,346
Monkey!

615
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:04,951
I'll break your neck!

616
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,425
Stop it!

617
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,977
It's all right.

618
00:57:20,196 --> 00:57:22,157
You go ahead.

619
00:57:22,177 --> 00:57:24,138
I'll deal with the human.

620
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,649
What about him?

621
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,693
Can we eat him?

622
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,791
No, you can't.

623
00:57:31,811 --> 00:57:32,979
Now go on.

624
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:41,614
Come here.

625
00:57:41,634 --> 00:57:42,698
Let's be friends.

626
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,879
Help me carry your master.

627
00:59:42,297 --> 00:59:44,153
You're smart.

628
00:59:44,173 --> 00:59:46,029
You know not to set foot on this island.

629
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,293
That human stench.

630
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,627
Go where you will.

631
01:00:00,647 --> 01:00:01,794
You're free.

632
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:36,858
There he is!

633
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:39,611
At last, the Nightwalker!

634
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,947
Quick, come and look.

635
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,826
That's why we've been sitting in these stinking bearskins.

636
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,662
Don't look, you'll go blind!

637
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,915
And you call yourselves hunters?

638
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,835
This decree from the Emperor...

639
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,921
...allows us to subdue the Deer God!

640
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:06,263
Now he's the Nightwalker.

641
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:11,435
When day begins, he becomes a deer again.

642
01:02:11,821 --> 01:02:12,843
He's going in.

643
01:02:12,863 --> 01:02:13,885
There!

644
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:37,970
- Jiko!

645
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:39,179
- I saw them.

646
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:41,691
Over there.

647
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,249
There must be hundreds of them.

648
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,584
They're not from these woods.

649
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,587
They're lords of some other forest.

650
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:11,930
It's Okkoto!

651
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:14,766
He swam across the straits?

652
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:17,060
No other boar has those tusks.

653
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,855
He brought his whole tribe.

654
01:04:23,369 --> 01:04:24,454
He knows we're here.

655
01:04:24,474 --> 01:04:25,559
Run!

656
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,917
Come on, jump!

657
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:35,639
There's no wound.

658
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,567
Yakul...

659
01:06:11,185 --> 01:06:13,333
If you're awake, thank Yakul.

660
01:06:13,353 --> 01:06:15,501
He never left your side.

661
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,265
You know his name?

662
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:25,188
He told me all about you, about your village and its forest.

663
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:29,192
I'll help you, because the Deer God saved your life.

664
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:34,990
I had a dream... a golden deer...

665
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,032
Eat this.

666
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:42,914
Chew.

667
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:16,091
We're here to kill humans and save the forest.

668
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,426
Why are humans here?

669
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,595
She is San, my daughter.

670
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:23,139
There are humans everywhere.

671
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:26,684
Go back to your homeland and kill them there.

672
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:30,396
We kill for the forest of the Deer God.

673
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:33,149
Why is the man here?

674
01:08:33,994 --> 01:08:36,038
The Deer God healed him.

675
01:08:36,058 --> 01:08:38,102
He should leave here alive.

676
01:08:38,332 --> 01:08:40,898
The Deer God saved him?

677
01:08:40,918 --> 01:08:43,484
The Deer God healed a human?

678
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,913
Why did he not save Nago?

679
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:51,000
Does the Deer God not protect all in the forest?

680
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:55,171
The Deer God gives life and takes it away.

681
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:59,217
Have you boars forgotten that?

682
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:03,805
You begrudge us the Deer God's favor.

683
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:05,974
You did nothing to help Nago!

684
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:10,478
He feared death, as do I.

685
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:14,983
I also carry within me a poisoned human stone.

686
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:17,267
Nago fled.

687
01:09:17,287 --> 01:09:19,435
I will stay here and face my death.

688
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,364
Ask the Deer God for help.

689
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:24,701
I have lived long enough, San.

690
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:28,329
The Deer God would probably take my life.

691
01:09:28,716 --> 01:09:30,134
No, Mother!

692
01:09:30,154 --> 01:09:31,572
You protect the Deer God.

693
01:09:32,052 --> 01:09:33,700
You lie!

694
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,368
Nago was beautiful and strong.

695
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:37,005
Our brother would never run.

696
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:40,300
You wolves ate him!

697
01:09:40,853 --> 01:09:42,188
Silence!

698
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,543
You slander my mother!

699
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,806
Hear me, all of you.

700
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:50,685
It was I who killed Nago.

701
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:55,148
He became a demon and attacked our village.

702
01:09:55,701 --> 01:09:57,558
A huge boar.

703
01:09:57,578 --> 01:09:59,435
Here is my proof.

704
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:09,162
I came to this land to ask the Deer God to lift this curse.

705
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:13,958
He healed my wound, but Nago's curse remains.

706
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:19,380
I must suffer until his curse destroys me.

707
01:10:24,355 --> 01:10:26,337
Ah, it's Okkoto.

708
01:10:26,357 --> 01:10:28,339
Finally, someone with some sense.

709
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:34,145
Okkoto, wait!

710
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:36,272
You mustn't eat him.

711
01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:40,580
You are Moro's daughter.

712
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,811
I have heard of you.

713
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:45,823
Your eyes...

714
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,607
Stand back.

715
01:10:47,627 --> 01:10:49,024
I will not eat him.

716
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:50,828
Wolf Princess...

717
01:10:51,507 --> 01:10:53,384
Fear not.

718
01:10:53,404 --> 01:10:55,281
I tell of Nago's end.

719
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:11,933
My thanks to you, young one.

720
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:18,314
It grieves us that our tribe spawned a demon.

721
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:24,153
Lord Okkoto, how I may lift the curse?

722
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:26,656
Leave this forest.

723
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:30,910
If we meet again, I must kill you.

724
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:35,748
You cannot win against the fire stones of the humans.

725
01:11:35,926 --> 01:11:38,617
Look on my tribe, Moro.

726
01:11:38,637 --> 01:11:41,328
We grow small and stupid.

727
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:44,924
Soon we will be nothing more...

728
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,635
...than game for the humans to hunt.

729
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:52,598
If you stake everything on one battle, you'll play into their hands.

730
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:56,269
I seek no help from wolves.

731
01:11:56,854 --> 01:12:03,026
Even if we all fall in battle, we will leave the humans in awe.

732
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,053
The Deer God...

733
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,780
Keep the oxen together!

734
01:12:52,419 --> 01:12:53,337
Hold your fire.

735
01:12:53,357 --> 01:12:54,275
Let them come.

736
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:56,120
Fire!

737
01:13:02,554 --> 01:13:03,222
Reload!

738
01:13:03,242 --> 01:13:03,910
Quick!

739
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:22,522
That damned Eboshi's fighting the wrong enemy.

740
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:25,358
Go on ahead and hide.

741
01:13:46,849 --> 01:13:47,892
It's them!

742
01:13:47,912 --> 01:13:48,955
They've returned.

743
01:13:54,565 --> 01:13:56,129
- Jiko!

744
01:13:56,149 --> 01:13:57,713
- Well done.

745
01:13:58,402 --> 01:14:00,092
We're moving out.

746
01:14:00,112 --> 01:14:01,802
Tell the others.

747
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,442
Hello, Jiko.

748
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:09,944
His Majesty is impatient.

749
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:12,488
This is no time for sport with country samurai.

750
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:16,284
Lord Asano sends them against me.

751
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:18,109
Asano?

752
01:14:18,129 --> 01:14:19,485
He's a powerful man.

753
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:21,914
He wants half my iron.

754
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,125
How greedy of him.

755
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,295
This is no time to fight men.

756
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:30,756
The boars are gathering in the forest.

757
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,634
Give Asano all your iron.

758
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,763
Keep your promise to His Majesty, then smash Asano.

759
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,631
Quick, Lady Eboshi!

760
01:14:39,651 --> 01:14:41,382
Asano's men are coming.

761
01:14:46,533 --> 01:14:47,930
Speak of the devil.

762
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,347
A messenger.

763
01:14:49,536 --> 01:14:50,767
An envoy approaches.

764
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:52,018
Remember your manners.

765
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:56,782
Welcome home!

766
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,746
Aren't you going to receive him?

767
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:10,755
Mistress Eboshi of the Ironworks, you fight well!

768
01:15:11,683 --> 01:15:14,019
I bring a message from my lord.

769
01:15:14,039 --> 01:15:16,375
Open the gate!

770
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:19,305
We can hear you from there.

771
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:22,391
Our lady took this mountain from the boars.

772
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,894
Now it's worth something and you want it.

773
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,312
On your way!

774
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:29,315
You are impudent, woman!

775
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:30,650
Impudent?

776
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:34,237
We've been impudent since the day we were born!

777
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:36,918
You want iron?

778
01:15:36,938 --> 01:15:38,065
Take some!

779
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,168
Eboshi's women are quite impressive!

780
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:52,213
Samurai or monsters, they don't care.

781
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:56,342
They certainly don't lack for courage.

782
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:00,096
What good is this paper?

783
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:03,724
It's helped me get the best hunters and trackers.

784
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:06,686
We're after a god, not just beasts.

785
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,981
Yes, my lady?

786
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:12,858
Do you know who this comes from?

787
01:16:13,537 --> 01:16:15,018
- The Son of Heaven.

788
01:16:15,038 --> 01:16:16,519
- The what?

789
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:19,198
The Emperor.

790
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:23,077
Oh, it's nothing special.

791
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:24,787
Off you go.

792
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:31,085
The more we make iron, the weaker the forest becomes.

793
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:33,588
We lose fewer lives.

794
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:36,591
We've spent too much time and money.

795
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:40,636
We didn't send 40 sharpshooters just for the iron.

796
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,681
At least that's what His Majesty would say.

797
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:49,103
Surely he doesn't believe that the head of a god confers immortality?

798
01:16:49,364 --> 01:16:52,096
I'm not privy to his thoughts.

799
01:16:52,116 --> 01:16:54,848
I prefer it that way.

800
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,403
I'll keep my promise.

801
01:16:57,529 --> 01:17:02,116
Boars are easier to deal with than Moro and her tribe.

802
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:06,871
You can summon that shady bunch hidden under the cliff.

803
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:11,417
You saw them, did you?

804
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:13,878
One more thing...

805
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,672
Did a young man pass through here?

806
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:19,967
A strange youth, riding a red elk.

807
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:21,802
He left.

808
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:43,282
They look frightening.

809
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,066
They're not ordinary hunters.

810
01:17:45,086 --> 01:17:46,692
They're special scouts.

811
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,039
Let us go with you.

812
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,999
Don't trust those men!

813
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,211
We can't help you from here if anything happens!

814
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,254
We know how to shoot.

815
01:17:57,881 --> 01:18:00,883
That's why I need you here.

816
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:04,512
I fear humans more than monsters.

817
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,599
With the Deer God dead, things will become clear.

818
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:13,396
Is the Deer God's head all the Emperor really wants?

819
01:18:14,147 --> 01:18:17,983
We may have to fight men with muskets, too.

820
01:18:18,829 --> 01:18:20,393
Men can't be trusted.

821
01:18:20,413 --> 01:18:21,977
Stay on your toes.

822
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:24,793
Don't worry about Lady Eboshi.

823
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:26,815
I'll protect her with my life.

824
01:18:27,087 --> 01:18:28,214
- I wonder.

825
01:18:28,234 --> 01:18:29,361
- What!

826
01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:31,747
I'd believe that coming from a woman!

827
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,486
Are you suffering?

828
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:49,158
You could simply jump and end the pain, you know.

829
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:52,745
When your strength returns, the curse will torment you.

830
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:55,998
I feel like I've slept for days.

831
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,752
I dreamed San was watching over me.

832
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:06,592
I hoped you would cry out in your sleep, so I could bite off your head.

833
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:08,344
These woods are beautiful.

834
01:20:08,678 --> 01:20:10,763
Are the boars moving yet?

835
01:20:11,149 --> 01:20:13,068
Go back into the cave, boy.

836
01:20:13,088 --> 01:20:15,007
You can't hear it...

837
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:18,270
The forest crying out as the boars move forward.

838
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:24,026
I hear the forest crying and feel the wasting of my body...

839
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,195
and I wait for that woman.

840
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:30,366
I dream of crushing her head in my jaws.

841
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:34,161
Can't humans and the forest live in peace?

842
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:36,372
Can't this be stopped?

843
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,749
The humans are gathering.

844
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:41,752
We're not safe, even here.

845
01:20:42,055 --> 01:20:43,640
And San?

846
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:45,245
Will you force her to die with you?

847
01:20:45,392 --> 01:20:47,311
How like a human.

848
01:20:47,331 --> 01:20:49,250
You think only of yourself.

849
01:20:49,729 --> 01:20:52,732
She is a daughter of our tribe.

850
01:20:52,752 --> 01:20:55,755
If the woods die, so will she.

851
01:20:56,111 --> 01:20:57,300
Set her free!

852
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,509
She's human.

853
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,145
Silence, boy!

854
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:03,232
What can you do for her?

855
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:10,239
The humans who violated the forest threw her in my path as they ran from me.

856
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,742
Now she is neither human nor wolf.

857
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:17,538
My poor, ugly, lovely daughter.

858
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:19,665
Can you save her?

859
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,879
I don't know, but together we can live.

860
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:29,561
How?

861
01:21:29,581 --> 01:21:32,042
Will you join San and fight the humans?

862
01:21:32,606 --> 01:21:33,920
No.

863
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:35,254
That will only breed more hatred.

864
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:40,227
There is nothing you can do.

865
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:43,647
Soon Nago's curse will kill you.

866
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:46,275
Leave this place at sunrise.

867
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:01,540
Can you walk?

868
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:07,046
Yes, thanks to you and the Deer God.

869
01:23:08,118 --> 01:23:09,203
Yakul!

870
01:23:09,223 --> 01:23:10,308
Did you worry?

871
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:17,616
My legs are still weak.

872
01:23:49,451 --> 01:23:50,848
It's too quiet.

873
01:23:50,868 --> 01:23:52,265
Where are the kodama?

874
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:01,410
I can smell the ironworks.

875
01:24:08,553 --> 01:24:10,221
Thank you for guiding me.

876
01:24:10,241 --> 01:24:11,909
I have a favor to ask.

877
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,425
Give this to San.

878
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:25,893
Let's go.

879
01:24:57,602 --> 01:24:58,729
What a stench!

880
01:24:58,749 --> 01:24:59,876
I can't breathe.

881
01:25:00,021 --> 01:25:02,440
That's tracker's smoke.

882
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,879
It will blunt our sense of smell.

883
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:06,058
It's her.

884
01:25:15,745 --> 01:25:17,705
- She knows we're here.

885
01:25:17,725 --> 01:25:19,685
- It's a trap.

886
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:20,697
Trap?

887
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:25,160
They want to lure the boars out of the woods.

888
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:27,204
Everything has been planned.

889
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:29,957
We've got to warn them.

890
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,250
They'll die!

891
01:25:31,876 --> 01:25:34,086
Okkoto is no fool.

892
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:38,715
The boars know it's a trap, but still they'll charge.

893
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,426
They are a proud race.

894
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:46,056
The last one alive will keep charging forward.

895
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:52,646
They're cutting trees.

896
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:54,481
Another provocation.

897
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,528
Mother, this is farewell.

898
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:02,364
The smoke will blind Okkoto.

899
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,408
I'll be his eyes.

900
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:06,702
As you like, San.

901
01:26:07,036 --> 01:26:10,998
But there is a life for you with that boy.

902
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:12,958
I hate humans!

903
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:27,389
From Ashitaka... for me?

904
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:32,853
It's beautiful.

905
01:26:33,396 --> 01:26:35,355
You two go with San.

906
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:38,066
I will stay with the Deer God.

907
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:39,234
Let's go.

908
01:27:00,225 --> 01:27:02,123
The tribe of Moro fights with you!

909
01:27:02,143 --> 01:27:04,041
Where is Okkoto?

910
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,222
Thank you!

911
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,600
It's coming from the ironworks.

912
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:42,190
Let's go.

913
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:47,529
Halt!

914
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:48,822
Samurai!

915
01:28:50,783 --> 01:28:51,908
Halt!

916
01:28:52,785 --> 01:28:54,077
Let me pass!

917
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:12,554
I don't believe it.

918
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:18,685
He's fending them off.

919
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,438
Don't waste your arrows.

920
01:29:45,588 --> 01:29:46,630
Quick!

921
01:29:46,766 --> 01:29:48,184
- You're right, it is him.

922
01:29:48,204 --> 01:29:49,622
- It's not a ghost.

923
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,718
Ashitaka!

924
01:29:52,105 --> 01:29:53,335
Toki!

925
01:29:53,355 --> 01:29:54,585
Are you all right?

926
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:56,306
Of course!

927
01:29:56,474 --> 01:30:00,685
They thought they'd catch us while the men were away.

928
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:02,062
We showed 'em!

929
01:30:02,448 --> 01:30:03,991
- They thought we'd be easy.

930
01:30:04,011 --> 01:30:05,554
- Where's Lady Eboshi?

931
01:30:05,775 --> 01:30:09,986
She took every man and went after the Deer God.

932
01:30:10,113 --> 01:30:12,364
We're trapped here and can't reach her.

933
01:30:12,667 --> 01:30:14,106
The Deer God?

934
01:30:14,126 --> 01:30:15,565
So that's what I heard.

935
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:18,286
Sir, I've still got your bow.

936
01:30:18,454 --> 01:30:20,872
What about his saddle and cloak?

937
01:30:21,008 --> 01:30:21,926
- I forgot.

938
01:30:21,946 --> 01:30:22,864
- You're useless!

939
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:24,793
Koroku, thanks!

940
01:30:25,012 --> 01:30:26,430
I'll bring help.

941
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:27,868
Can you hold on?

942
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:31,174
We'll pour hot iron on them if we have to!

943
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:32,854
- Hurry, Ashitaka!

944
01:30:32,874 --> 01:30:34,418
- Bring Lady Eboshi.

945
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:41,268
Missed!

946
01:30:41,404 --> 01:30:42,384
They're bringing boats.

947
01:30:42,404 --> 01:30:43,384
Hurry!

948
01:30:43,531 --> 01:30:45,408
Summon Lady Eboshi.

949
01:30:45,428 --> 01:30:47,305
We'll fight, too!

950
01:30:49,162 --> 01:30:50,101
I'll be back.

951
01:30:50,121 --> 01:30:51,060
Keep fighting!

952
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,657
We'll be here!

953
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:01,705
Kill that man!

954
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:12,799
They're after us, Yakul!

955
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:57,385
Burning flesh...

956
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:04,726
Yakul!

957
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:45,183
Stay back!

958
01:32:57,738 --> 01:32:59,531
Show me the wound.

959
01:33:01,669 --> 01:33:03,046
Wait here.

960
01:33:03,066 --> 01:33:04,443
I'll be back.

961
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:08,456
Stay, I said!

962
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:21,344
We're almost there.

963
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:07,098
Who goes there?

964
01:34:07,683 --> 01:34:11,227
You're not allowed here.

965
01:34:11,947 --> 01:34:14,325
I'm indebted to these men.

966
01:34:14,345 --> 01:34:16,723
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.

967
01:34:17,036 --> 01:34:18,996
She's not here.

968
01:34:19,016 --> 01:34:20,976
I'll see that she gets it.

969
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:22,687
I will speak to her.

970
01:34:22,707 --> 01:34:23,854
Where is she?

971
01:34:24,033 --> 01:34:27,369
Ashitaka, you made it after all!

972
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:29,871
You've suffered badly.

973
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:31,873
Some men are still buried.

974
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:33,333
It was horrible.

975
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:35,794
The ironworks are under attack.

976
01:34:36,555 --> 01:34:38,641
There's still time.

977
01:34:38,661 --> 01:34:40,747
The women are holding the inner stockade.

978
01:34:40,966 --> 01:34:42,217
This cannot stand!

979
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:44,844
Asano waited until we left.

980
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:46,805
Where's Lady Eboshi?

981
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,724
She went after the Deer God.

982
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:50,840
Call her back.

983
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:51,840
There's no time!

984
01:34:52,363 --> 01:34:54,156
If you're finished, get moving.

985
01:34:54,176 --> 01:34:55,969
Get back to work!

986
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:57,565
And the ironworks?

987
01:34:57,692 --> 01:34:59,317
Now wait a minute!

988
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:02,195
They're ready to sacrifice us all.

989
01:35:02,998 --> 01:35:04,771
- There's no time to lose.

990
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:06,564
- Send Eboshi a message!

991
01:35:06,711 --> 01:35:08,317
She's deep in the woods.

992
01:35:08,337 --> 01:35:09,943
We'll never find her.

993
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:12,956
Send one of your trackers, then.

994
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:16,000
They're using Lady Eboshi.

995
01:35:16,752 --> 01:35:19,421
Were there any wolves with the boars?

996
01:35:20,089 --> 01:35:22,298
Have you seen Princess Mononoke?

997
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:26,052
It was pitch black when they came at us.

998
01:35:26,178 --> 01:35:27,470
She was there.

999
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:31,099
We were on the front line...

1000
01:35:31,308 --> 01:35:32,142
And?

1001
01:35:32,278 --> 01:35:34,364
I don't know.

1002
01:35:34,384 --> 01:35:36,470
All of a sudden, the world turned upside down...

1003
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:40,066
The scouts put us there to lure the boars in.

1004
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:42,235
There were mines underneath us...

1005
01:35:42,361 --> 01:35:44,362
and grenades from above.

1006
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:39,334
Where's San?

1007
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:46,049
Be still, I want to help you.

1008
01:36:49,605 --> 01:36:51,295
A wolf!

1009
01:36:51,315 --> 01:36:53,005
There's a wolf still alive over here.

1010
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:55,099
Sir, what are you...

1011
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:00,355
Sir!

1012
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,857
What are you doing, boy?

1013
01:37:03,734 --> 01:37:07,612
He'll take me to Eboshi.

1014
01:37:07,863 --> 01:37:09,948
So you're with them, are you?

1015
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:11,866
Step aside.

1016
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:16,287
Would you sacrifice these men and their families?

1017
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:18,540
Poison darts!

1018
01:37:24,713 --> 01:37:25,713
Stop!

1019
01:37:32,638 --> 01:37:34,764
Give me a hand!

1020
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,234
He's free!

1021
01:37:57,955 --> 01:38:00,832
Go through the swamp and hide near the lake.

1022
01:38:01,468 --> 01:38:02,866
They have sharpshooters.

1023
01:38:02,886 --> 01:38:04,284
Be careful.

1024
01:38:04,763 --> 01:38:06,035
Take this.

1025
01:38:06,055 --> 01:38:07,327
My last arrow broke.

1026
01:38:10,009 --> 01:38:11,301
Go with them.

1027
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:12,677
Look after him!

1028
01:38:16,859 --> 01:38:17,944
Find San.

1029
01:38:17,964 --> 01:38:19,049
That's where Eboshi is.

1030
01:38:30,956 --> 01:38:32,708
Keep up with the scouts.

1031
01:38:32,728 --> 01:38:34,480
We finish this today!

1032
01:38:37,286 --> 01:38:38,119
Jiko!

1033
01:38:38,297 --> 01:38:39,402
Well?

1034
01:38:39,422 --> 01:38:40,527
How does it look?

1035
01:38:40,799 --> 01:38:43,156
Okkoto's hurt.

1036
01:38:43,176 --> 01:38:45,533
He and the girl are going to the Deer God.

1037
01:38:46,055 --> 01:38:47,786
So they're going to ask him for help.

1038
01:38:47,806 --> 01:38:49,537
Stay with them.

1039
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:52,592
Keep out of sight or he won't appear.

1040
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:54,302
Of course.

1041
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:58,348
Was that boar blood on his face?

1042
01:38:59,109 --> 01:39:00,549
It's a scout trick.

1043
01:39:00,569 --> 01:39:02,009
Revolting, isn't it?

1044
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:13,112
We're almost at the Deer God's pond.

1045
01:39:30,923 --> 01:39:32,173
Something's coming!

1046
01:39:35,312 --> 01:39:36,855
Something's wrong, Okkoto!

1047
01:39:36,875 --> 01:39:38,418
We have to keep moving.

1048
01:39:39,181 --> 01:39:40,765
Something bad is coming.

1049
01:39:41,026 --> 01:39:42,319
I can't smell it.

1050
01:39:42,339 --> 01:39:43,632
There's too much blood.

1051
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:50,066
Apes!

1052
01:39:50,192 --> 01:39:51,567
You did this.

1053
01:39:51,704 --> 01:39:52,997
Your fault.

1054
01:39:53,017 --> 01:39:54,310
Forest die.

1055
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:58,700
Is this how you thank those who fought for your forest?

1056
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:00,868
You bring monsters.

1057
01:40:01,046 --> 01:40:02,423
Not animal!

1058
01:40:02,443 --> 01:40:03,820
Not human!

1059
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:06,541
Neither animal nor human?

1060
01:40:12,933 --> 01:40:13,747
- They're here!

1061
01:40:13,767 --> 01:40:14,581
- Doom!

1062
01:40:14,601 --> 01:40:15,415
Doom!

1063
01:40:34,778 --> 01:40:35,945
Scouts?

1064
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:40,950
They're here!

1065
01:40:42,244 --> 01:40:47,582
My warriors have returned from the land of the dead.

1066
01:40:52,139 --> 01:40:54,537
Forward, my warriors!

1067
01:40:54,557 --> 01:40:56,955
To the Deer God!

1068
01:41:03,525 --> 01:41:05,132
Okkoto, no!

1069
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:06,759
Your warriors haven't come back to life.

1070
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:15,276
The boar skins hide their scent.

1071
01:41:15,527 --> 01:41:16,611
Humans!

1072
01:41:19,541 --> 01:41:21,335
Stop!

1073
01:41:21,355 --> 01:41:23,149
They want us to lead them to the Deer God!

1074
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,624
Come out, Deer God!

1075
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:35,797
If you are lord of this forest, revive my warriors to slay the humans.

1076
01:41:37,518 --> 01:41:38,645
Okkoto!

1077
01:41:38,665 --> 01:41:39,792
Still your heart!

1078
01:41:40,479 --> 01:41:41,515
We're surrounded!

1079
01:41:41,535 --> 01:41:42,571
He's done for.

1080
01:41:42,591 --> 01:41:43,627
Leave him!

1081
01:41:43,899 --> 01:41:45,339
No!

1082
01:41:45,359 --> 01:41:46,799
He'll become a demon!

1083
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:51,145
Tell Mother it's the Deer God the humans want.

1084
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:53,731
She'll know what to do.

1085
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:58,361
We can't let our kind die out!

1086
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:00,571
Go!

1087
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:25,096
I'll kill the first one who moves, and tell the forest what you are.

1088
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:37,483
Ashitaka?

1089
01:42:44,199 --> 01:42:45,241
Get back!

1090
01:42:52,092 --> 01:42:54,136
I burn!

1091
01:42:54,156 --> 01:42:56,200
A flame bursts from within me.

1092
01:42:57,462 --> 01:42:58,880
No!

1093
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:01,268
No, Okkoto!

1094
01:43:01,288 --> 01:43:02,706
Don't turn into a demon!

1095
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,053
Okkoto!

1096
01:43:09,474 --> 01:43:10,600
An answer!

1097
01:43:13,864 --> 01:43:14,782
- What is it?

1098
01:43:14,802 --> 01:43:15,720
- San's in danger!

1099
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:16,772
Let's go!

1100
01:43:45,177 --> 01:43:46,510
It's hot!

1101
01:43:55,572 --> 01:43:56,990
No!

1102
01:43:57,010 --> 01:43:58,428
I don't want to be a demon!

1103
01:43:58,607 --> 01:44:00,024
Okkoto!

1104
01:44:11,588 --> 01:44:12,298
Too slow.

1105
01:44:12,318 --> 01:44:13,028
Get on.

1106
01:44:27,302 --> 01:44:28,427
A wolf!

1107
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:32,640
Eboshi...

1108
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:40,982
Go on ahead!

1109
01:44:42,484 --> 01:44:44,527
Eboshi, listen to me!

1110
01:44:44,913 --> 01:44:46,081
- Cease fire!

1111
01:44:46,101 --> 01:44:47,269
- Ashitaka?

1112
01:44:47,874 --> 01:44:50,315
The ironworks are under attack.

1113
01:44:50,335 --> 01:44:52,776
Forget the Deer God and go back!

1114
01:44:53,036 --> 01:44:54,578
The women need help.

1115
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:57,322
Your men are on their way.

1116
01:44:57,342 --> 01:44:59,324
They're waiting for you.

1117
01:44:59,751 --> 01:45:01,836
What proof do you have?

1118
01:45:02,055 --> 01:45:03,849
None!

1119
01:45:03,869 --> 01:45:05,663
I would have stayed and fought if I could!

1120
01:45:06,341 --> 01:45:09,969
You want me to kill samurai instead of the Deer God?

1121
01:45:10,188 --> 01:45:12,232
No!

1122
01:45:12,252 --> 01:45:14,296
Can't the forest and the ironworks live in peace?

1123
01:45:16,862 --> 01:45:18,447
- Whose side is he on?

1124
01:45:18,467 --> 01:45:20,052
- Let's go back!

1125
01:45:20,699 --> 01:45:23,118
The women can hold their own.

1126
01:45:23,138 --> 01:45:25,557
They have weapons and supplies.

1127
01:45:28,248 --> 01:45:29,479
There's the pond.

1128
01:45:29,499 --> 01:45:30,730
He's close!

1129
01:45:32,252 --> 01:45:33,462
It's now or never.

1130
01:45:33,482 --> 01:45:34,692
Stay alert.

1131
01:45:35,495 --> 01:45:37,163
Do we need her?

1132
01:45:37,382 --> 01:45:38,988
We're hunting a god.

1133
01:45:39,008 --> 01:45:40,614
Let her do the dirty work.

1134
01:46:07,621 --> 01:46:08,393
Moro!

1135
01:46:08,413 --> 01:46:09,185
Are you dead?

1136
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:10,696
San!

1137
01:46:10,822 --> 01:46:12,490
Where are you?

1138
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:14,658
San!

1139
01:46:22,125 --> 01:46:23,417
Ashitaka!

1140
01:46:30,926 --> 01:46:32,009
Okkoto...

1141
01:46:40,268 --> 01:46:41,727
Leave, boy.

1142
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:45,147
If we fight, the god won't come.

1143
01:46:49,621 --> 01:46:51,018
Okkoto!

1144
01:46:51,038 --> 01:46:52,435
Be still!

1145
01:46:56,461 --> 01:46:58,526
Give me Princess Mononoke.

1146
01:46:58,546 --> 01:47:00,611
Where is San?

1147
01:47:01,216 --> 01:47:02,843
San, can you hear me?

1148
01:47:02,863 --> 01:47:04,490
It's me, Ashitaka!

1149
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:11,424
San!

1150
01:47:19,182 --> 01:47:20,516
Silence him!

1151
01:47:25,355 --> 01:47:27,273
Shoot him down!

1152
01:47:51,506 --> 01:47:56,218
San!

1153
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:00,014
Ashitaka!

1154
01:48:04,978 --> 01:48:05,769
San!

1155
01:48:06,438 --> 01:48:07,605
Ashitaka!

1156
01:48:15,238 --> 01:48:21,744
And here I was saving my last strength for that woman.

1157
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:23,454
Close up!

1158
01:48:41,223 --> 01:48:43,641
Stay away from him.

1159
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:45,809
The curse will fall on you.

1160
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:57,071
Have you lost even the power of speech?

1161
01:48:57,999 --> 01:49:00,189
Well done.

1162
01:49:00,209 --> 01:49:02,399
Fall back and tend to the wounded.

1163
01:49:03,995 --> 01:49:06,247
A horrible sight.

1164
01:49:15,215 --> 01:49:16,090
There he is.

1165
01:49:28,603 --> 01:49:30,646
Give me back my daughter!

1166
01:49:53,128 --> 01:49:54,169
Ashitaka...

1167
01:49:54,629 --> 01:49:56,880
Can you save San?

1168
01:50:06,516 --> 01:50:08,017
The Deer God...

1169
01:50:19,154 --> 01:50:20,738
Don't shoot!

1170
01:50:34,429 --> 01:50:36,327
Eboshi!

1171
01:50:36,347 --> 01:50:38,245
Your enemy is not the Deer God!

1172
01:50:39,215 --> 01:50:40,466
Guns can't hurt him...

1173
01:50:40,592 --> 01:50:42,134
Only through the head...

1174
01:50:52,103 --> 01:50:52,978
San!

1175
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:04,031
Don't die!

1176
01:51:31,559 --> 01:51:34,561
They wanted life, but it gave them death.

1177
01:51:54,676 --> 01:51:56,553
- It's the Nightwalker!

1178
01:51:56,573 --> 01:51:58,450
- Watch closely, all of you.

1179
01:51:58,878 --> 01:52:00,921
This is how you kill a god.

1180
01:52:01,339 --> 01:52:03,924
This is also the god of death.

1181
01:52:04,259 --> 01:52:06,135
Stay close behind me.

1182
01:52:23,069 --> 01:52:24,278
Stop!

1183
01:52:27,657 --> 01:52:28,741
Eboshi!

1184
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:43,130
Damn you!

1185
01:52:53,401 --> 01:52:54,653
Got him!

1186
01:52:54,673 --> 01:52:55,925
Get the head!

1187
01:53:34,984 --> 01:53:36,152
Jiko!

1188
01:53:36,172 --> 01:53:37,340
Bring the box!

1189
01:53:38,363 --> 01:53:39,740
The porters are dead!

1190
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:41,137
Quick!

1191
01:53:42,951 --> 01:53:44,828
Don't touch the body!

1192
01:53:44,848 --> 01:53:46,725
It'll suck the life out of you.

1193
01:53:50,542 --> 01:53:51,731
Take it!

1194
01:53:51,751 --> 01:53:52,940
The head is yours.

1195
01:54:01,376 --> 01:54:02,584
Lady Eboshi!

1196
01:54:03,002 --> 01:54:05,712
Moro's head... it moved by itself!

1197
01:54:05,974 --> 01:54:07,830
Come on, hurry!

1198
01:54:07,850 --> 01:54:09,706
Run!

1199
01:54:14,097 --> 01:54:15,764
Run!

1200
01:54:32,490 --> 01:54:33,740
To the island!

1201
01:54:33,918 --> 01:54:35,253
- I can't swim!

1202
01:54:35,273 --> 01:54:36,608
- It's shallow.

1203
01:55:05,158 --> 01:55:06,138
Bring her here.

1204
01:55:06,158 --> 01:55:07,138
I'll kill her!

1205
01:55:07,358 --> 01:55:10,777
Moro's had her revenge.

1206
01:55:11,122 --> 01:55:12,124
- Lady Eboshi!

1207
01:55:12,144 --> 01:55:13,146
- Help me.

1208
01:55:17,285 --> 01:55:19,620
Don't waste your sympathy.

1209
01:55:19,954 --> 01:55:22,414
I promised Toki I'd bring you back.

1210
01:55:28,806 --> 01:55:30,016
It's searching for its head.

1211
01:55:30,036 --> 01:55:31,246
We can't stay here.

1212
01:55:31,633 --> 01:55:32,424
San!

1213
01:55:33,176 --> 01:55:34,217
Help me.

1214
01:55:34,354 --> 01:55:35,647
No!

1215
01:55:35,667 --> 01:55:36,960
You're on their side!

1216
01:55:37,138 --> 01:55:39,222
Take her and go away!

1217
01:55:42,153 --> 01:55:43,280
Keep away!

1218
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:44,427
I hate humans!

1219
01:55:45,406 --> 01:55:47,096
I am human.

1220
01:55:47,116 --> 01:55:48,806
So are you.

1221
01:55:48,942 --> 01:55:49,691
Shut up!

1222
01:55:49,943 --> 01:55:51,610
I'm a wolf!

1223
01:55:53,196 --> 01:55:54,363
Don't touch me!

1224
01:56:00,338 --> 01:56:01,944
I'm sorry.

1225
01:56:01,964 --> 01:56:03,570
I tried to stop it.

1226
01:56:10,765 --> 01:56:12,684
Everything is finished.

1227
01:56:12,704 --> 01:56:14,623
The forest is dead.

1228
01:56:24,278 --> 01:56:25,787
No it's not.

1229
01:56:25,807 --> 01:56:27,316
We're still alive.

1230
01:56:27,336 --> 01:56:28,845
Help me.

1231
01:56:54,559 --> 01:56:55,498
Wait!

1232
01:56:55,518 --> 01:56:56,457
Help us!

1233
01:56:56,676 --> 01:56:59,553
A little danger and they're useless.

1234
01:57:02,765 --> 01:57:04,224
Don't stop!

1235
01:57:10,064 --> 01:57:11,398
The head's moving!

1236
01:57:14,902 --> 01:57:16,611
It's calling him!

1237
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:01,031
That will fix it.

1238
01:58:01,157 --> 01:58:02,115
Thanks.

1239
01:58:02,835 --> 01:58:04,462
- It's too quiet.

1240
01:58:04,482 --> 01:58:06,109
- They're waiting for dawn.

1241
01:58:07,163 --> 01:58:10,290
I wonder if that young man found Eboshi.

1242
01:58:10,510 --> 01:58:12,887
I'm sure he did.

1243
01:58:12,907 --> 01:58:15,284
She should be here soon.

1244
01:58:17,809 --> 01:58:19,769
Look at that face.

1245
01:58:19,789 --> 01:58:21,749
Hey, Koroku!

1246
01:58:21,969 --> 01:58:24,721
Let him sleep for now.

1247
01:58:35,034 --> 01:58:36,244
What is it?

1248
01:58:36,264 --> 01:58:37,474
It sounds unearthly.

1249
01:58:50,331 --> 01:58:51,581
The Nightwalker!

1250
01:59:05,555 --> 01:59:07,305
Hold your positions!

1251
01:59:08,401 --> 01:59:09,840
- It's coming this way.

1252
01:59:09,860 --> 01:59:11,299
- We've got to run.

1253
01:59:11,863 --> 01:59:13,531
We guard the ironworks!

1254
01:59:13,551 --> 01:59:15,219
We promised Lady Eboshi.

1255
01:59:21,914 --> 01:59:22,894
It's him!

1256
01:59:22,914 --> 01:59:23,894
Ashitaka!

1257
01:59:29,203 --> 01:59:30,287
Everyone, escape!

1258
01:59:30,872 --> 01:59:33,915
The Deer God is coming for his head!

1259
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:36,668
Touch that muck and you're dead!

1260
01:59:37,054 --> 01:59:38,472
Go to the lake.

1261
01:59:38,492 --> 01:59:39,910
The water will protect you.

1262
01:59:40,464 --> 01:59:43,717
Lady Eboshi and the men are coming from the other side.

1263
01:59:44,135 --> 01:59:47,053
We must return the head!

1264
01:59:47,305 --> 01:59:48,180
Hurry!

1265
01:59:48,806 --> 01:59:50,056
It's here.

1266
01:59:50,641 --> 01:59:52,058
What do we do?

1267
01:59:52,226 --> 01:59:53,643
Don't panic.

1268
01:59:53,769 --> 01:59:55,228
To the lake!

1269
01:59:55,531 --> 01:59:56,866
Stay calm!

1270
01:59:56,886 --> 01:59:58,221
Help the injured.

1271
02:00:07,867 --> 02:00:09,534
Not that way!

1272
02:00:26,010 --> 02:00:28,094
There goes the roof...

1273
02:00:33,601 --> 02:00:37,437
Once the forge starts to burn, it's all over.

1274
02:00:38,032 --> 02:00:39,249
No, it isn't.

1275
02:00:39,269 --> 02:00:40,486
We're still alive.

1276
02:00:40,506 --> 02:00:41,723
Farther... quickly!

1277
02:00:59,710 --> 02:01:01,002
There they are!

1278
02:01:13,391 --> 02:01:14,266
Go!

1279
02:01:15,393 --> 02:01:16,685
Wait!

1280
02:01:17,446 --> 02:01:19,136
You're still alive?

1281
02:01:19,156 --> 02:01:20,846
That's good.

1282
02:01:21,492 --> 02:01:22,910
I'll return the head.

1283
02:01:22,930 --> 02:01:24,348
Leave it and go.

1284
02:01:24,829 --> 02:01:26,254
Give it back now?

1285
02:01:26,274 --> 02:01:27,699
It's too late.

1286
02:01:27,719 --> 02:01:29,144
The sun's coming up.

1287
02:01:29,333 --> 02:01:31,168
Look!

1288
02:01:31,188 --> 02:01:33,023
A brainless, life-sucking god of death.

1289
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:34,869
He'll vanish with the sun.

1290
02:01:35,131 --> 02:01:36,111
He's coming, Jiko.

1291
02:01:36,131 --> 02:01:37,111
Quick!

1292
02:01:37,248 --> 02:01:42,252
The thirst to possess heaven and earth is what makes us human.

1293
02:01:42,545 --> 02:01:44,087
I don't want to kill you.

1294
02:01:45,339 --> 02:01:46,589
Oh, dear.

1295
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:48,842
Don't look so serious.

1296
02:01:55,683 --> 02:01:56,850
Get going!

1297
02:02:16,537 --> 02:02:17,704
Ashitaka!

1298
02:02:25,713 --> 02:02:26,921
Trapped.

1299
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:30,884
We're surrounded!

1300
02:02:32,146 --> 02:02:33,460
- Sun, come quickly!

1301
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:34,794
- Open it!

1302
02:02:34,940 --> 02:02:36,025
Don't you understand?

1303
02:02:36,045 --> 02:02:37,130
It's too late.

1304
02:02:37,558 --> 02:02:39,726
Ashitaka, talking with humans is useless.

1305
02:02:40,269 --> 02:02:41,978
Human hands must return it.

1306
02:02:44,023 --> 02:02:45,732
I warned you.

1307
02:03:00,748 --> 02:03:02,415
O Deer God...

1308
02:03:02,666 --> 02:03:04,417
We return your head!

1309
02:03:04,919 --> 02:03:06,753
Be at peace!

1310
02:03:17,765 --> 02:03:19,933
Here it comes!

1311
02:03:50,933 --> 02:03:52,122
- It stopped.

1312
02:03:52,142 --> 02:03:53,331
- There they are!

1313
02:04:06,647 --> 02:04:07,897
Lady Eboshi!

1314
02:04:08,232 --> 02:04:10,150
Careful, she's hurt.

1315
02:04:38,345 --> 02:04:40,472
It's falling!

1316
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:48,480
Hang on tight!

1317
02:05:55,422 --> 02:05:59,342
I didn't know the Deer God made flowers bloom.

1318
02:06:30,457 --> 02:06:32,250
San, look!

1319
02:07:02,865 --> 02:07:06,117
Even restored, these are not the Deer God's woods.

1320
02:07:06,702 --> 02:07:08,745
The Deer God is dead.

1321
02:07:09,256 --> 02:07:10,904
He can't die.

1322
02:07:10,924 --> 02:07:12,572
He is life itself.

1323
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:15,001
He is both life and death.

1324
02:07:15,919 --> 02:07:17,754
He is telling us we should live.

1325
02:07:26,315 --> 02:07:28,088
I love you, Ashitaka.

1326
02:07:28,108 --> 02:07:29,881
But I'll never forgive the human race.

1327
02:07:30,309 --> 02:07:34,228
Then live in the forest, and I'll live at the ironworks.

1328
02:07:34,855 --> 02:07:36,230
Together, we'll live.

1329
02:07:36,815 --> 02:07:39,192
Yakul and I will visit you.

1330
02:07:51,215 --> 02:07:53,363
Can you believe it?

1331
02:07:53,383 --> 02:07:55,531
Carried to safety by a wolf.

1332
02:07:56,387 --> 02:07:58,014
Someone bring Ashitaka.

1333
02:07:58,034 --> 02:07:59,661
I want to thank him.

1334
02:08:00,391 --> 02:08:02,393
We'll start over.

1335
02:08:02,413 --> 02:08:04,415
We'll build a good village here.

1336
02:08:05,145 --> 02:08:07,043
I give up.

1337
02:08:07,063 --> 02:08:08,961
You can't win against fools.

1338
02:08:33,580 --> 02:13:20,032
