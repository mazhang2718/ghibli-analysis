00:00:07,240 --> 00:02:12,298
Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television, Hakuhodo present Only Yesterday Executive Producers Yasuyoshi TOKUMA Yoshio SASAKI and Ritsuo ISOBE Based on "Omoide Poroporo" by Hotaru OKAMOTO and Yuko TONE Voices Miki IMAI Toshiro YANAGIBA Yoko HONNA Music by Masaru HOSHI Theme song performed by Harumi MIYAKO Producer Toshio SUZUKI General Producer Hayao MIYAZAKI Screenplay written & directed by Isao TAKAHATA With ten days off, I figured you'd go abroad.

2
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,094
But you're off to Yamagata, right?

3
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,190
Yes.

4
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,532
Broke up with your boyfriend?

5
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,465
I just prefer the countryside.

6
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:22,178
- See ya!

7
00:02:22,198 --> 00:02:22,792
- Bye!

8
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,267
Let's go play!

9
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,935
Bye now!

10
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,774
Later!

11
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,248
Did you get good grades?

12
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:31,919
No.

13
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:33,432
But I don't care.

14
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,383
How come?

15
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,650
As soon as I get home, we're traveling to Grandma's.

16
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,055
So I won't get yelled at for ages.

17
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,731
Lucky you!

18
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:43,312
Are you going away too?

19
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,869
Yeah, to Nagano.

20
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:46,319
How about you, Taeko?

21
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,330
I'm not sure.

22
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,068
My Dad bought a summer place.

23
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,828
Wow... that's great!

24
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,708
Such a bad grade in math again.

25
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,311
But I got a "B" in science.

26
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,340
Are we going away for the holidays?

27
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,882
Not really.

28
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,619
Take me someplace.

29
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,441
I'll take you to a movie.

30
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:12,671
Find out what's playing.

31
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:14,295
Not that.

32
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:15,808
I mean to the country...

33
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:16,827
The country?

34
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,296
Like Grandma's country house.

35
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,889
Grandma lives with us.

36
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,173
- Grandpa's then...

37
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:23,356
- He's dead.

38
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,565
We don't have relatives in the country, so don't ask.

39
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,613
My family had lived in Tokyo for generations.

40
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,775
I envied friends who had family in the countryside.

41
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:43,308
It's too late to book.

42
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:44,838
All hotels will be full.

43
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,156
But I really want to go...

44
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,589
What about "Onoya"?

45
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,800
We're regulars.

46
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,848
They'd have a room for us.

47
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,127
Where's that?

48
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:56,954
Good idea.

49
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:58,683
Taeko's never been there.

50
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,965
That's right.

51
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,837
Is it in the mountains... by the sea?

52
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,836
It's in Atami.

53
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,069
Atami?

54
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,808
You get to ride the bullet train.

55
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,907
Sure, you ll love it.

56
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,679
Atami...

57
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,553
Lots of different hot springs...

58
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,886
There's a huge Roman Bath.

59
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:28,798
And others, like the Swan Bath and the Violet Bath.

60
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,698
The beautiful Violet Bath!

61
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,032
The Violet Bath...

62
00:04:33,182 --> 00:04:34,294
Oh yes.

63
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:35,426
It's fantastic.

64
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,372
You love hot springs, right?

65
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:41,843
Since father's working, you four go.

66
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,340
What?!

67
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,250
Us?

68
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,787
Go too?!

69
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,363
I'm amazed you show up every morning.

70
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,162
Everyone else has left town.

71
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,768
Aren't you going anywhere?

72
00:05:08,084 --> 00:05:08,764
- Yes, I am.

73
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:09,464
- Where?

74
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,633
Atami.

75
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,464
Atami?

76
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:14,028
What's in Atami?

77
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,944
Hot springs.

78
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,376
It's good timing.

79
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,480
We're going away next week.

80
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,150
No-one will be around for ages.

81
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:32,853
Hello.

82
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:33,785
Okajima residence.

83
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,289
Nanako?

84
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:36,688
It's Taeko.

85
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:39,040
I leave today.

86
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,287
Any message for your husband's family?

87
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:44,061
Not really.

88
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:46,291
Just buy them something.

89
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,245
Say it's from us and I'll pay you back.

90
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:51,057
Don't worry about it.

91
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:52,775
How's Mom?

92
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,409
She's out today.

93
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:58,887
She was mad you turned down that guy's proposal.

94
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,856
"At 27, that's the best offer she's going to get!"

95
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,556
It's all she talks about.

96
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:07,589
She's got a point.

97
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:09,523
You're not young anymore...

98
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:10,829
Oh, yeah?

99
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,427
Definitely.

100
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,938
You've got to settle down eventually.

101
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,535
By the way, did you really work in the fields last year?

102
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:21,466
Yes, harvesting rice.

103
00:06:21,486 --> 00:06:23,297
This year, I'm picking safflower.

104
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,440
Safflower?

105
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,577
Thanks to you, I finally have family in the countryside.

106
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,157
So, I'm making the most of it!

107
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,256
Give me a break!

108
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:43,191
Rather than stay in that old house, why not treat yourself to a fancy hotel for once?

109
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,395
Maybe you'd meet a nice boy.

110
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:47,875
No way.

111
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:50,122
You mean a hotel like "Onoya"?

112
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,642
"Onoya"?

113
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,872
Not that again!

114
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,150
You've got to get over it.

115
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,312
Let go of that baggage from the past!

116
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:16,693
My sisters, of course, would never go to a place like atami.

117
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,669
Grandma...

118
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,571
Almost done?

119
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,341
Let's go to another bath.

120
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,846
We just went.

121
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,576
Only to the Swan Bath.

122
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:44,960
Bored to tears, I went alone to the Brothers Grimm Bath the Mermaid Bath, the Lemon Bath, and the Violet Bath, one after the other.

123
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,089
It's enormous!

124
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,125
When I got to the Roman Bath, my head was spinning.

125
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,831
It's amazing...

126
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,546
And I fainted.

127
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,116
And with that, my trip was over.

128
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,989
Followed by endless weeks of vacation.

129
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:33,704
The other day, my sisters and I were reminiscing.

130
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:42,048
We couldn't stop laughing as the memories came flooding back.

131
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,153
Had one before?

132
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,956
No, it's my first time.

133
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,091
I'm the one who asked for it.

134
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,426
Yeah, we know.

135
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,797
Where did you buy it?

136
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,267
Senbikiya in Ginza.

137
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,837
Must have been expensive.

138
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,034
How do we eat it?

139
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,369
Slice it into rings.

140
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,943
But how?

141
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,379
I don't know.

142
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,778
Didn't you ask in the store?

143
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,782
We'll eat it next Sunday.

144
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,292
Why not now?!

145
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,953
We don't know how.

146
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,632
I'll have a banana.

147
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,362
Me too.

148
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,174
Strange fruit they have in those hot countries.

149
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,481
I'm home!

150
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,817
I know how to eat the pineapple!

151
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,215
Really?

152
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,390
I'll take that.

153
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,423
Mind your fingers.

154
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,826
Wouldn't a carving knife be best?

155
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,001
What a nice smell.

156
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,313
It smells so good.

157
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,191
I see.

158
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:29,996
Get plates.

159
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:30,741
Quick.

160
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,127
Okay.

161
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,196
Let us eat.

162
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,686
It's hard.

163
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,725
It's not very good.

164
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,389
Not so sweet.

165
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,559
Nothing like the canned stuff.

166
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,503
Live long enough and you see lots of different things.

167
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:19,967
- You can have mine.

168
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:21,133
- Mine too.

169
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,573
It's delicious...

170
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,348
Don't force yourself.

171
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,045
You'll get a stomachache.

172
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,263
What a let down.

173
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,132
Bananas taste much better.

174
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,466
You're so right.

175
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,701
Bananas are still the king of fruits.

176
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,071
I ll have one now.

177
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:55,503
The king of fruit is...

178
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,872
the banana, after all.

179
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:07,848
The year I fainted at the baths and had my first pineapple...

180
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,625
the Beatles came to Japan, started the rock 'n'roll band and electric guitar craze.

181
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,931
My sister Nanako, a freshman in art school, was up on all the trends.

182
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,103
Yeah, the Beatles'lyrics are great.

183
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:34,908
When she wore a mini-skirt, she'd cover her bottom going up the stairs.

184
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:43,313
My clever sister, Yaeko, was crazy about some Takarazuka actress.

185
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,753
Yaeko...

186
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,786
I told you to knock!

187
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:57,467
My sisters' memories are mainly of fashion and pop trends.

188
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,830
For them, 1966 is the height of nostalgia.

189
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,770
Whereas I was only ten years old.

190
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,546
My favorite band had yet to debut....

191
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:16,280
My only memories are the back and forth between school and home.

192
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,356
...mine was pinned on the wall!

193
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,618
That's nice.

194
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:25,095
And it might be entered in an essay contest.

195
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,791
So, teacher kept it.

196
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:29,957
- I'd be so happy...

197
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:31,657
- You didn't finish lunch again.

198
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,836
Why do you hide the pickles inside the bread?

199
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,840
'Cause I hate them.

200
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:38,730
I've got to throw it away.

201
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,528
What a waste.

202
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,112
Such a picky eater!

203
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:50,115
I'd rather you were a good eater than a good essay writer.

204
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,839
How can you drink that stuff?

205
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,351
Milk's okay.

206
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,302
It's onions I hate.

207
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,077
I'm leaving carrots so I've got no choice.

208
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:24,514
Who decided we can only leave one thing?

209
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:25,749
Shall I drink it?

210
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,086
Would you?

211
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,418
You'll eat my onions next time?

212
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:44,014
- Carrots?

213
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:45,163
- We're allowed one thing!

214
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,418
Two bowls is gross.

215
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,847
People who run in the corridor...

216
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:05,056
...when the hall monitor says stop, should be punished.

217
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,591
How are you gonna do that?

218
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,566
They shouldn't do it.

219
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,861
That's right.

220
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,937
You might bump into someone.

221
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,373
If I bumped into you I'd bounce a mile!

222
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,603
Get lost!

223
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,176
Running is no big deal.

224
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,375
I agree!

225
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:27,274
- Let's change the rule.

226
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:28,974
- But we already decided.

227
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,713
Raise your hand if you want to speak.

228
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:33,259
- Here!

229
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,271
- Miss Tani.

230
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:42,457
The hall monitor should chase the offender, catch them and punish them.

231
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:44,626
Mr.

232
00:16:44,646 --> 00:16:45,326
Suzuki.

233
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:50,236
Then the hall monitor should be punished for running too.

234
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:51,049
He's right!

235
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:51,766
He's right!

236
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,734
Way to go!

237
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:54,913
He's right.

238
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,004
Miss Tani.

239
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:02,380
The hall monitor shouldn't be punished because...

240
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:08,019
...it's like a policeman chasing a speeding car.

241
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,494
Any objections?

242
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,131
It makes sense...

243
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,968
No more running.

244
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:27,878
So, the hall monitor can chase offenders.

245
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,482
Any other issues?

246
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,117
Miss Tani.

247
00:17:34,797 --> 00:17:35,539
- Her again.

248
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,301
- Busybody.

249
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,753
Be quiet.

250
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,256
Some people don't finish lunch.

251
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:45,457
I just read an article on the Vietnam War.

252
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,427
There are many unfortunate people overseas.

253
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,093
We're very lucky.

254
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,103
Lucky to have you near me!

255
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,744
We should be grateful for our food.

256
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:06,583
We're allowed to leave one thing on our plates, but I think it's wrong!

257
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,952
Goody two-shoes.

258
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:14,611
- It can't hurt to leave one thing.

259
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:16,841
- Let's all leave milk...

260
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:18,533
- Give it to someone else...

261
00:18:18,553 --> 00:18:20,114
- Of course.

262
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:22,270
- People hide leftovers in bread.

263
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,318
- That's cheating!

264
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,470
I hate school food.

265
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,273
If you want to speak, raise your hand!

266
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,533
What a revolting situation.

267
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:47,714
That night in bed, after chatting to my sisters more memories from fifth grade came rushing back.

268
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:53,084
Our pet dog... .

269
00:18:53,104 --> 00:18:55,416
School sports day...

270
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,862
being scared by gross horror comics....

271
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,901
longing for an electric pencil-sharpener...

272
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:08,737
So many little details, one after the other...

273
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:16,310
playing in my head like a movie, almost overpowering me.

274
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,084
Is there a Miss Okajima here?

275
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:25,752
That's her.

276
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,040
Hirota in our class says he likes you.

277
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,044
Let's go.

278
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,922
We'll say we told you.

279
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,324
Told you.

280
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,832
Where is it?

281
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,960
Over there.

282
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,635
Shuji Hirota and Taeko Oka jima lt's true!

283
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,241
What's he like?

284
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:14,149
- No idea.

285
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:14,963
- Me, neither.

286
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,571
Taeko, you sure you don't know him?

287
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,379
No... of course not... not at all.

288
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,558
Which one is Hirota?

289
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:28,918
It's the girls from Room 5.

290
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,120
Hirota, they're looking for you.

291
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,488
I'm here!

292
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,227
Don't write silly things on the wall.

293
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,769
Taeko told us to tell you.

294
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,932
I didn't write anything.

295
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,739
You said you liked Okajima in Room 5.

296
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,108
You did.

297
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,738
So, we wrote it for you.

298
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,987
I love you so much....

299
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,888
But you're so far away....

300
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,358
Like gazing up at...

301
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,689
Goodbye.

302
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:07,026
A far distant star.

303
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,831
Taeko!

304
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,836
We just went to see Hirota.

305
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,870
We told him not to write things on walls.

306
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,343
Tsuneko!

307
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,939
Ah, no running.

308
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,616
Aren't you glad?

309
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:51,509
5th Grade: Room 4 Over here.

310
00:21:51,953 --> 00:21:53,332
See?

311
00:21:53,352 --> 00:21:54,731
That's him.

312
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:02,793
What?

313
00:22:02,813 --> 00:22:04,977
Hirota likes Taeko?

314
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,979
He's amazing.

315
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:08,378
A real star.

316
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,324
You mean baseball?

317
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,761
Only Tono can hit his pitches.

318
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,196
Really?

319
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:19,259
Our team plays his in the next game.

320
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:29,040
Go, go, Hirota!

321
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,617
Go for it, Tono!

322
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,648
Hit it, Tono!

323
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,578
Kill it!

324
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,892
Go for it, Hirota!

325
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,856
Taeko's watching you!

326
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,897
Hit it, Tono!

327
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,052
Way to go, Hirota!

328
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,117
Strike him out!

329
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,487
Don't you dare cheer their side!

330
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,652
Of course not!

331
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:20,595
Go, go, Tono!

332
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:37,610
Hiro, Hiro, Hirota!

333
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,679
Hit it!

334
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,010
One leg stance!

335
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:57,563
Wow!

336
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,796
Way to go, Hirota!

337
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,646
I knew nothing about baseball.

338
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,478
But even I could tell he was superb.

339
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,494
Go, go, Hirota!

340
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,760
What's up, Taeko?

341
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:34,065
Between the cold and the excitement, I ran to the bathroom five times.

342
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,829
Over here, over here!

343
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,438
Game!

344
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,243
Room 4 wins.

345
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,016
Thank you for the game.

346
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,121
You were great Hirota!

347
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,352
Good job.

348
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,360
You were amazing!

349
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,662
It was all your fault.

350
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:00,822
How come?

351
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,365
You don't know anything.

352
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:06,132
If Tono couldn't hit him, how could we?

353
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,364
That's right.

354
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,173
You missed the throw and three runs scored.

355
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,074
That's not true.

356
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,209
Coach said he'd buy us ice cream.

357
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:18,170
- Really?

358
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,035
- Great!

359
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,610
Hirota, you should go see her.

360
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,382
Yeah, you should.

361
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,949
I'm going home.

362
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,190
What's the matter, Taeko?

363
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,967
Look, she left.

364
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:27,781
Um...

365
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,286
...that stuff...

366
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:42,830
...on the wall...

367
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,566
Rainy day or...

368
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,833
cloudy or sunny day...

369
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,872
which do you like?

370
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:09,455
Cloudy.

371
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,795
Me too!

372
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:56,659
Rainy day or cloudy or sunny day.

373
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,160
Which do you like?

374
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,999
Me, too.

375
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:27,865
I didn't intend the ten year-old me to come on this trip.

376
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:35,536
But somehow, once she showed up she wouldn't leave me alone.

377
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,965
But why me in the 5th grade?

378
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:16,437
Second hour, all boys play baseball, all girls to the gym.

379
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:17,344
How come?

380
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,938
Baseball, great!

381
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:34,627
Today I'm going to talk about something very important.

382
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:44,369
You'll leave grade school, then junior school then high school.

383
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:47,911
Then become grown ups and have babies.

384
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:52,005
A woman's body prepares to have babies.

385
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,919
Did you know?

386
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,019
Really?

387
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:09,900
Mom told me when I was in fourth grade, since I'm an early-developer.

388
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:10,899
Early-developer?

389
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,230
That's right.

390
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:17,133
She said tall girls or big girls get their periods early.

391
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:22,643
I bet those other girls already have theirs.

392
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:29,691
- Are you gonna buy them?

393
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:30,539
- I am.

394
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,883
I knew it.

395
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,147
You'll buy them, too, right?

396
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,793
Well... yeah.

397
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,227
I think you should.

398
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:44,163
Nurse said we all need them eventually.

399
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,634
That's true.

400
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:02,111
The girls are buying underpants in the infirmary.

401
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,754
Did you know?

402
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:08,848
No.

403
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,928
But why?

404
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,257
How come you're buying underpants?

405
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,696
It's because...

406
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:17,893
Umm...

407
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,100
Why is the school selling underpants?

408
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,762
Are they for swimming?

409
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,202
You told Nakayama?

410
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,241
Why did you do that!?

411
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,144
You shouldn't tell boys.

412
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,979
It's supposed to be our secret.

413
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:41,990
It's because she likes him...

414
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,822
Did he ask you?

415
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,668
What's going on?

416
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,067
She told Nakayama about periods.

417
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,999
No!

418
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,203
He'll tell everyone.

419
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,675
I said to keep it secret.

420
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,406
You trust him?

421
00:33:06,728 --> 00:33:08,472
- Oh no...

422
00:33:08,492 --> 00:33:10,236
- Boys are disgusting.

423
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,685
Now they'll be looking up our skirts.

424
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:17,886
Pervert!

425
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:23,700
Looking up skirts was all the rage and periods became an obsession.

426
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,269
You got your period!

427
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,635
Cut it out!

428
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,666
Second period break.

429
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:33,641
Idiot.

430
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:34,837
Ouch.

431
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:35,913
Come here!

432
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,713
You've got a period.

433
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,444
No, I don't!

434
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,718
It's all Rie's fault.

435
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,221
I'm sorry.

436
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,489
What for?

437
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,031
For telling Nakayama.

438
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,600
It doesn't matter.

439
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:00,936
The nurse said it's very important.

440
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,169
I know.

441
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:06,302
I started when I was in fourth grade.

442
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,639
Really?

443
00:34:09,023 --> 00:34:10,080
That's why I skip P.

444
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,157
E.

445
00:34:11,177 --> 00:34:12,234
Sometimes.

446
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,329
You skip P.

447
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:14,118
E.

448
00:34:14,138 --> 00:34:14,907
With a period?

449
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:18,079
Mom said I should.

450
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:23,885
He even said he felt sorry for us.

451
00:34:24,372 --> 00:34:25,433
You told him about skipping P.

452
00:34:25,453 --> 00:34:26,514
E.?

453
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:31,593
He promised not to tell the others.

454
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:33,304
So, then they'll think all girls who skip P.

455
00:34:33,324 --> 00:34:34,916
E.

456
00:34:34,936 --> 00:34:36,528
Have periods!

457
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:37,967
You think so?

458
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,100
Of course!

459
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,191
Please excuse Taeko from P.

460
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:45,412
E.

461
00:34:45,432 --> 00:34:46,633
Because of her cold.

462
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,059
I'm not missing P.

463
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:53,838
E.

464
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:57,758
Your cold will get worse.

465
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,591
Then I'll stay home.

466
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:00,702
No.

467
00:35:00,722 --> 00:35:01,617
You don't have a fever.

468
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:02,534
Then I'll do P.

469
00:35:02,554 --> 00:35:03,279
E.

470
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,959
Fine, go ahead.

471
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,900
Don't blame me if it gets worse.

472
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:13,367
See you later.

473
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,182
Since when was she so fond of P.

474
00:35:16,202 --> 00:35:17,729
E.?

475
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,189
You're bright red.

476
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,723
She's right.

477
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,224
Are you okay?

478
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,288
I have a cold.

479
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,058
You have a fever.

480
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:32,767
You should skip P.

481
00:35:32,787 --> 00:35:33,381
E.

482
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,022
Yeah, you should.

483
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,760
I'll go tell the teacher.

484
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,093
No, don't.

485
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,430
Why not?

486
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,063
Mom already wrote a note.

487
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,237
There's no problem then.

488
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,470
Out of the way!

489
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,405
Ouch!

490
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:57,376
I'm missing P.

491
00:35:57,396 --> 00:35:58,241
E.

492
00:35:58,261 --> 00:35:59,106
Too.

493
00:35:59,126 --> 00:35:59,971
Just like you.

494
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,992
Lucky them.

495
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,301
I wish I could play, too.

496
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,470
Do you...

497
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,311
...are you having a period?

498
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,772
Yes.

499
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,740
I'm not.

500
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,940
I have a cold.

501
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:29,407
I know.

502
00:36:29,427 --> 00:36:30,772
You're sick.

503
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:32,243
Just sick.

504
00:36:32,263 --> 00:36:33,608
That's all.

505
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,752
A period isn't a sickness.

506
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,901
I could still play...

507
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,906
I'm gonna catch a period!

508
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,438
Don't touch it, don't touch it!

509
00:36:53,955 --> 00:36:55,300
That was close.

510
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,665
Almost caught it...

511
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,314
Over here, over here!

512
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,013
"Catch a period"!

513
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,354
What a silly thing to say.

514
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,894
It's no laughing matter!

515
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,869
Taeko?

516
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,878
It's the period pair!

517
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,344
No, we're not!

518
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,482
Stupid boys.

519
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,322
You're so calm about it.

520
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:48,592
Mom said it's nothing to be ashamed of.

521
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,201
I guess so, but...

522
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:59,966
Like it or not, a butterfly must first...

523
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:05,111
live as a caterpillar before it can fly away.

524
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:22,959
Maybe I remember those days because I was going through the caterpillar stage.

525
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:31,174
Something definitely changed when I started working.

526
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:38,742
at work and at play we girls were livelier and more spirited than guys.

527
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,583
It was like we'd finally found our wings.

528
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:50,891
But looking back now, maybe we were just flexing them pointlessly.

529
00:38:55,966 --> 00:39:05,104
Perhaps the fifth grade me was tagging along with a message for me to reflect and rethink my life.

530
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:16,619
Anyway, I decided to sleep the rest of the way.

531
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:04,833
Ouch!

532
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,878
Excuse me, has the Tokyo train gone?

533
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,977
Was that your train?

534
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,141
No...

535
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,921
Taeko Okajima, right?

536
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,218
Yes, that's correct...

537
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,126
Thank goodness.

538
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:35,763
The car's this way.

539
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,728
Excuse me, but who are you?

540
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,866
You don't remember?

541
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,734
Of course you don't.

542
00:40:45,419 --> 00:40:47,179
I'm Toshio.

543
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,959
Kazuo s second cousin.

544
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,507
Oh, I see...

545
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,753
What's so funny?

546
00:41:04,405 --> 00:41:05,619
Nothing.

547
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:06,853
Sorry.

548
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,964
I thought you were trying to steal my bag.

549
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,361
That's terrible.

550
00:41:15,381 --> 00:41:17,762
Didn't I ask your name?

551
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:20,128
Yes, you did.

552
00:41:20,148 --> 00:41:22,358
I just thought... sorry...

553
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,206
I beg your pardon.

554
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,648
No problem.

555
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,284
Where's Kazuo?

556
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:39,359
He asked me last night to come pick you up It's been raining?

557
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:42,193
Yeah, but it'll clear today.

558
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:50,700
I should've used my Dad's car but I like mine better.

559
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,143
It's a little tight.

560
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,287
May I leave it on?

561
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:14,887
Sure.

562
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,853
This is unusual music.

563
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,859
It's a Hungarian group.

564
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,333
Hungarian?

565
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,000
You know a lot about it?

566
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:57,344
A little.

567
00:42:57,364 --> 00:42:58,425
It's farmer's music.

568
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,237
I like it because I'm a farmer.

569
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,508
Cool.

570
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,403
Right?

571
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:31,802
Remember last year's party at the farmhouse?

572
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:37,605
A bunch of guys turned up, right?

573
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,672
Maybe you don't remember.

574
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:45,955
They came to check out the girl from Tokyo.

575
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,024
I was one of them.

576
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,588
Watch out, jerk!

577
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:05,361
I heard you're picking safflower.

578
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:08,092
Do you dye fabric?

579
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,737
Just curious.

580
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:13,569
Safflower's kind of unusual.

581
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:16,300
Well, maybe not for you.

582
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:24,491
It's known as a famous local product but hardly anyone grows it.

583
00:44:24,772 --> 00:44:27,033
- Wasn't it big in the old days?

584
00:44:27,053 --> 00:44:29,314
- For the merchants, sure.

585
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:34,361
They got rich, but for farmers, it was just another crop.

586
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,475
Do you know: In time whose skin will it grace, this crimson flower.

587
00:44:42,589 --> 00:44:44,599
The famous Basho poem?

588
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:46,629
I read it before coming.

589
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,315
Is that so?

590
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,579
I only learned it last night.

591
00:44:54,725 --> 00:45:03,395
I also read that the flower-pickers couldn't afford to wear the rouge they made.

592
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,875
Is that where you had the barbeque?

593
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:18,171
There'll be another this year, too.

594
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:33,689
Are market reforms making agriculture difficult?

595
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,662
Absolutely.

596
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:41,334
As things go, Japanese farming might just collapse, all of sudden, one day.

597
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:49,177
But then again, anything worth struggling for will be hard work.

598
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:51,770
Isn't it the same in the city?

599
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:53,174
Yes.

600
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:57,450
But fewer people live for their work.

601
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:00,313
What about you?

602
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,451
Me?

603
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:09,727
I don't live for my job but I don't hate it either.

604
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:14,866
I could farm twenty-four hours a day.

605
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:18,399
It's fascinating to raise living things.

606
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,467
You have livestock?

607
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:27,763
Not that.

608
00:46:27,783 --> 00:46:30,721
We've got some animals, but I'm talking about rice, apples, cherries.

609
00:46:30,741 --> 00:46:33,679
They're all living things.

610
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:41,923
If we take good care of them, I feel like they'll do their best for us.

611
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,764
Listen to me preach.

612
00:46:48,182 --> 00:46:49,845
Not at all.

613
00:46:49,865 --> 00:46:51,528
I get what you mean.

614
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:55,237
To tell the truth, I used to work in an office.

615
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:58,872
I only just started farming.

616
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:02,017
Is that right?

617
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:05,145
That's why I'm so enthusiastic.

618
00:47:05,165 --> 00:47:07,614
It's very important.

619
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:12,755
I quit work and joined my friend's organic farm.

620
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:16,390
People said I'm nuts, but I don't regret it.

621
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,961
Organic farm?

622
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:25,070
"Grown with no artificial chemicals whatsoever."

623
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:29,404
Just blood, sweat and tears!

624
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:34,177
We use all natural stuff, no pesticides or anything.

625
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:42,025
I've seen the labels: "No chemicals used" But it's not just that.

626
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,561
We bring out the plant's life force.

627
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:50,395
It's cool... like lending nature a hand.

628
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:56,103
Sounds easy, but it's damn hard work.

629
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,512
I was told to take you straight to the fields.

630
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,608
Yes, I'm starting right away.

631
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,244
Not going to rest?

632
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:16,292
Don't you pick the flowers early while the thorns are still soft?

633
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,883
That's right, but...

634
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:21,362
I'm trying to become an early-riser.

635
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,526
That's why I took the night train.

636
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:27,365
You're certainly eager.

637
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:56,495
There it is!

638
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,754
'Morning, everyone!

639
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,298
Great to have you back, Taeko.

640
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,236
Thanks for having me.

641
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:15,775
Grandma, you re looking well.

642
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,311
Welcome back dear.

643
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,507
Aren't you tired?

644
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,008
No, not at all.

645
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:25,217
We made your bed just in case.

646
00:50:25,399 --> 00:50:26,943
That's okay.

647
00:50:26,963 --> 00:50:28,507
Look, I'm raring to go!

648
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:32,789
Wearing work pants too!

649
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,665
That's all I brought.

650
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:41,927
Young people here don't wear them any more.

651
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:45,437
You look like the real thing Taeko.

652
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,667
That's right.

653
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:11,961
Taeko!

654
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,060
Don't!

655
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:24,636
And so began my second taste of country life.

656
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:39,418
How could this yellow flower produce such a bright red?

657
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,533
They told me a sad tale from the old days.

658
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:52,773
The girls didn't have gloves, and their bare hands would get pricked by the thorns.

659
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:57,212
It was their blood that made the red so deep.

660
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:07,212
I could imagine the resentment they must've felt toward the fancy city girls.

661
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:13,462
To make a handful of rouge took nearly 500 lbs of petals.

662
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:19,695
This rouge was literally worth its weight in gold.

663
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:51,517
The petals are washed, trodden, then exposed to the air and the sun.

664
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:55,724
As the petals oxidize, they gradually turn red.

665
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:05,201
After a few more days, fermentation turns them bright red and they become sticky.

666
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:17,712
Pounded, wrung into balls and sun-dried, they finally become the basic ingredient of rouge.

667
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:26,228
The liquid from the pressing wasn't wasted either.

668
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:33,002
The red pigment in the yellow broth was used to dye fabric.

669
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,593
Let's go dye our cloth.

670
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,998
Safflower do your best.

671
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,702
Cheer me up with your pretty color.

672
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:49,617
For those village girls, with no chance of make-up or kimonos, Safflower dye brought color into their drab lives.

673
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:58,925
The yellow pigment dissolves in water leaving clothes a light pink.

674
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,020
So pretty!

675
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:12,535
Machines now take away some of the work, but the petal's still need picking every day.

676
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:44,265
Rouge cakes soon mould, and the flowers wait for no one.

677
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:50,676
No sooner are you done picking, than they bloom again.

678
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:59,145
When the rains come, work continues into the early hours.

679
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:09,799
Each day flew by, Pleasantly tired, I thought about the flower-pickers of old.

680
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:20,675
If I could've worked like this as a child, my school essays would've been really interesting.

681
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,454
Mom, I need 5,000 yen.

682
00:56:38,571 --> 00:56:39,831
5,000 yen?

683
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:41,111
I can't give you that.

684
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,792
You said you'd buy me new sneakers.

685
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,131
Are they that much?

686
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:49,036
Nonsense.

687
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,299
They're Pumas.

688
00:56:50,917 --> 00:56:52,097
- Pumas?

689
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,297
- It's a brand.

690
00:56:55,388 --> 00:56:57,769
I'm not sure.

691
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:00,170
There must be cheaper ones.

692
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:02,308
How about the ones you've got?

693
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,853
Nobody wears them now.

694
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,114
Everyone's getting Pumas.

695
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:09,418
Who's everyone?

696
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:13,587
Kako, Megu, Yachan, Nonchan.

697
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,755
That's only four people.

698
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:19,297
Everyone's wearing them!

699
00:57:19,412 --> 00:57:21,156
No.

700
00:57:21,176 --> 00:57:22,920
You never do your chores.

701
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:27,476
Did you ask for a dress for your Barbie Doll?

702
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:32,544
Didn't you promise to ask only at Christmas and your birthday?

703
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,281
You always spoil her.

704
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:38,213
Is that right, Taeko?

705
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:42,280
All of a sudden, the ten year-old me was back.

706
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,424
But...

707
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:49,421
Yaeko got a kimono and it wasn't even her graduation.

708
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,131
It's for tea-ceremony.

709
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:57,496
You keep asking for lots of little stuff, we get one or two big things.

710
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,402
Right?

711
00:57:58,508 --> 00:57:59,736
Yep.

712
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,008
Stop that.

713
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,982
Always picky about food.

714
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,253
Dad loves the onions, right?

715
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:18,786
Anyway, that kimono will be yours in the end.

716
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:21,026
Always hand-me-downs.

717
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,951
- Some people don't get anything.

718
00:58:22,971 --> 00:58:24,782
- Exactly.

719
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:27,927
Then give me that enamel purse.

720
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:29,561
Didn't you give it to her yet?

721
00:58:29,682 --> 00:58:31,778
You're too old for that.

722
00:58:31,798 --> 00:58:33,894
Give it to her.

723
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,012
I don't want it.

724
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,314
Keep the stupid purse.

725
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:51,158
Then I won't give it to you.

726
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,553
I'm not buying you a new one.

727
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:54,493
Fine.

728
00:58:55,441 --> 00:58:57,201
Good.

729
00:58:57,221 --> 00:58:58,981
I actually really like it.

730
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,996
I hate it.

731
00:59:05,118 --> 00:59:06,679
Ready for dinner.

732
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:08,260
Take this away.

733
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,812
See, has to be thrown away.

734
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,882
What a waste.

735
00:59:14,294 --> 00:59:15,457
Don't throw it away!

736
00:59:15,477 --> 00:59:16,640
Please Mother.

737
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,015
It's your fault.

738
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,118
Finish it yourself next time.

739
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:25,350
You three are so selfish.

740
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,404
Father, buy me an enamel purse.

741
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,076
Yaeko won't give me hers.

742
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,046
You said you didn't want it.

743
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,814
Yeah, but...

744
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,583
You said it, you have to do it.

745
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,493
Hurry up and get ready.

746
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:09,769
I'll wear these!

747
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:15,238
Why is Yaeko coming?

748
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:21,173
You said it was just the three of us.

749
01:00:22,028 --> 01:00:24,192
Because I finished my homework.

750
01:00:24,212 --> 01:00:26,376
Is that a problem?

751
01:00:26,966 --> 01:00:28,476
It's Chinese food.

752
01:00:28,496 --> 01:00:30,006
The more the merrier.

753
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,923
Grandma's not coming.

754
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,725
She doesn't eat oily food.

755
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,466
If you don't want to come, stay here.

756
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,959
We're going Taeko.

757
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,797
Come on slowpoke.

758
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:14,066
I don't have a purse.

759
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:19,206
Lend her that enamel one.

760
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:44,930
Here.

761
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:47,796
Ouch.

762
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:49,837
Let's go.

763
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,537
I'm not going.

764
01:01:51,651 --> 01:01:53,013
Okay.

765
01:01:53,033 --> 01:01:54,395
Let's go Mother.

766
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:57,244
Stay with Grandma then.

767
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,745
Not coming Taeko?

768
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,416
No I'm not.

769
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:26,838
We're off then.

770
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:38,144
I'm coming too!

771
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,465
No shoes!

772
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,264
Father please.

773
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,165
A button came off.

774
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:41,106
We didn't go out, of course.

775
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:46,119
My face was swollen and a cold towel didn't stop the stinging.

776
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:52,258
That night I couldn't sleep wondering why it was always me.

777
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:57,825
Figuring I must've been adopted I cried myself to sleep.

778
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:01,799
Was it the first time he hit you?

779
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:05,431
Yes, the first and only time.

780
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:11,773
Dad slaps me often... well, sometimes.

781
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,907
Maybe that's easier.

782
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:18,783
When it's only once, you can't stop thinking why.

783
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:24,117
It's hard to imagine you a selfish brat.

784
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:27,151
A spoiled brat.

785
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:30,198
I wasn't just fussy about onions, either.

786
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:35,165
Now I don't feel like I'm that bad.

787
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:37,171
Wait a second!

788
01:04:37,283 --> 01:04:39,664
Your poor Mom.

789
01:04:39,684 --> 01:04:42,065
I shouldn't encourage you.

790
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,978
I'm giving up on the Pumas.

791
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:52,384
Good girl.

792
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:56,783
Maybe I'll slip you some pocket money.

793
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,190
Hooray!

794
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:21,710
Hey!

795
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,377
100 yen each.

796
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:32,657
Taeko...

797
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,990
Tomorrow...

798
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,699
Let's go for a drive to Zao.

799
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:38,855
- Zao?

800
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:39,720
- Yes.

801
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:42,797
You went to Yamadera last year, right?

802
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:44,997
The family said it was okay.

803
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,061
The views at Zao were beautiful.

804
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:18,737
But Zao had become famous and touristy.

805
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,011
How come you re not married?

806
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:30,279
Do you find that strange?

807
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,954
Well, no, not really.

808
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:36,053
Lots of women work now.

809
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:39,650
Most of my friends are single.

810
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,625
Oh, is that right?

811
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,096
That's right.

812
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:44,697
I see.

813
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,192
It's true.

814
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:48,127
Right.

815
01:06:48,381 --> 01:06:49,424
Really.

816
01:06:49,444 --> 01:06:50,487
It's very common.

817
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,446
Toshio?

818
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:02,378
In elementary school, could you do fractions?

819
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:09,082
When they said reverse the numerator and denominator, could you do it?

820
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:12,024
I don't remember.

821
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:15,253
I wasn't bad at math though.

822
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,729
I see.

823
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:18,159
Lucky you.

824
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:21,430
I bet you don't remember 'cause it was easy.

825
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:23,126
Maybe.

826
01:07:23,146 --> 01:07:24,525
Why do you ask?

827
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:30,538
It seems that people who could do it went on to have easy lives.

828
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:41,145
One girl, completely average ...not even good at math, always could do it perfect right away.

829
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:47,453
She grew up really normal and now has two kids.

830
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,933
I was no good at it.

831
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,238
Not smart enough to know when to quit.

832
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:15,848
Room 5, Taeko Okajima. 25 points Before the test...

833
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:21,755
...we had art class.

834
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:26,633
And... um... we did blow pictures.

835
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,395
Blow pictures?

836
01:08:29,415 --> 01:08:31,363
Yes.

837
01:08:31,383 --> 01:08:33,331
We drop paint on the paper...

838
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,606
and blow patterns in it.

839
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:40,113
And?

840
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:45,519
You blow like this, really hard, right?

841
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,419
Yes?

842
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,611
So, I got a headache.

843
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:53,342
From blowing so hard.

844
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:55,858
That's why you did so badly?

845
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,763
That's right.

846
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:01,462
I see.

847
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:09,939
Do you know the answers now?

848
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,476
The correct answers?

849
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:14,910
Well...

850
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:18,050
Have Yaeko help you with them.

851
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,846
Yaeko?!

852
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,353
That's right.

853
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:24,121
Or Nanako, whichever.

854
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,259
I'll ask Nanako.

855
01:09:50,596 --> 01:09:52,908
Nanako's not back yet.

856
01:09:52,928 --> 01:09:55,240
Can I wait til after dinner?

857
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:07,162
I'll ask Yaeko...

858
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,578
Mother!

859
01:10:26,365 --> 01:10:27,295
Mother!

860
01:10:27,315 --> 01:10:28,245
Mother!

861
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:31,992
What is this?!

862
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:33,992
How on earth...?

863
01:10:34,106 --> 01:10:36,082
Please teach her.

864
01:10:36,102 --> 01:10:38,078
She doesn't seem to get it.

865
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:43,201
But this is beyond belief!

866
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:44,966
That's why I'm asking you...

867
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,974
Is she alright in the head?

868
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,101
Just help her.

869
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:52,239
Normally this is easy.

870
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,279
But that child's not normal!

871
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:13,091
Taeko, your sister's going to help.

872
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:19,030
You had a headache from blowing, didn't you?

873
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,706
Sit.

874
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,609
Say your times table from the top.

875
01:11:30,729 --> 01:11:32,308
I know that.

876
01:11:32,328 --> 01:11:33,907
I'm in fif th grade already!

877
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,354
Then why so many mistakes?!

878
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:40,053
It's dividing fractions.

879
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:51,169
Just flip the top and the bottom and multiply.

880
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:53,741
They taught you that, right?

881
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,502
Then why do you get it wrong?

882
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:00,908
Yaeko, one step at a time.

883
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,482
What's dividing a fraction by a fraction anyway?

884
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:19,595
Two-thirds of an apple divided by a quarter means...

885
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:26,166
how would this divide between four people, right?

886
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:34,881
So, it's one, two, three, four, five, six...

887
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:37,110
one-sixth each, right?

888
01:12:39,264 --> 01:12:40,661
No, no, no, no.

889
01:12:40,681 --> 01:12:42,078
That's multiplication.

890
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:45,858
How come it's less when you multiply?

891
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:50,263
Two-thirds of an apple divided by a quarter...

892
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:55,058
Anyway!

893
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:59,105
Forget about apples...

894
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:03,702
just remember to inverse and multiply.

895
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:14,380
Is her sister in Takarazuka?

896
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:14,833
No, S.

897
01:13:14,853 --> 01:13:15,186
K.

898
01:13:15,206 --> 01:13:15,539
D.

899
01:13:16,602 --> 01:13:18,311
- She got "D" in math.

900
01:13:18,331 --> 01:13:20,040
- "D"?

901
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:23,256
Yes, and just barely.

902
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:29,295
If she got half right, it'd be worth scolding her.

903
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,134
Right.

904
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:34,901
Should you get her IQ checked?

905
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:37,706
They said it was fine when she started.

906
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:39,474
Maybe she turned dumb?

907
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:42,379
Remember she fell downstairs as a baby?

908
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:45,214
Right, in her walker!

909
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:47,354
I thought she was dead.

910
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:49,390
It was just a bump.

911
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:50,958
It's affecting her now.

912
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:52,720
That's it!

913
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:55,620
Nonsense.

914
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,821
She's just no good at math.

915
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,629
She chats too much in class.

916
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:05,297
If she'd just listen,; even an idiot can do it.

917
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:09,707
It's only two more years until Junior High.

918
01:14:09,822 --> 01:14:14,269
Two-thirds of this apple, divided by a quarter...

919
01:14:14,289 --> 01:14:18,736
I can't even picture it.

920
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:25,989
Two-thirds of this, into a quarter makes it...

921
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:36,870
Even now, dividing fractions is difficult.

922
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:46,806
We farmers give up too easily.

923
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:52,146
We just yield to the flow and follow what they do in the cities.

924
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:55,155
Let's rethink the real meaning of prosperity.

925
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:59,250
Return to the old ways of farming.

926
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:02,121
Wow...

927
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:07,092
So, that explains the organic farming?

928
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:14,066
I'm just quoting my friend.

929
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,010
But I agree with it.

930
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,681
It's great the way you hold onto your memories of math class.

931
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:26,117
It wasn't meant to impress you.

932
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:34,760
People say you work in a great place but I could never give myself up to it completely.

933
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:41,268
I really admire your devotion to farming.

934
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:45,404
You re being sarcastic?

935
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,272
Of course not!

936
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,902
There aren't many people like you.

937
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:57,952
Farming's in total decline, right?

938
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:02,617
So we can't just carry on as normal.

939
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:05,488
We've got to think about the future.

940
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:12,663
We help each other out, cheer one another along, otherwise we can't keep it up.

941
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,198
Taeko do you ski?

942
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:24,443
I've been with friends a few times.

943
01:16:24,556 --> 01:16:26,566
Come next winter.

944
01:16:26,586 --> 01:16:28,596
I'll teach you.

945
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:30,947
Are you good?

946
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:35,713
No, but I'm an instructor there.

947
01:16:35,901 --> 01:16:37,480
An instructor?

948
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,079
You must be great.

949
01:16:39,338 --> 01:16:40,951
All my friends are too.

950
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:42,584
It's nothing.

951
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:11,219
At last, we're in the middle of nowhere.

952
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,153
"Nowhere" huh?

953
01:17:14,272 --> 01:17:15,816
Sorry.

954
01:17:15,836 --> 01:17:17,380
I didn't mean it like that.

955
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,325
Interesting point though.

956
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:29,401
City people see the trees and rivers and are grateful for "nature".

957
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:34,882
But what you see here is all made by man.

958
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:36,876
By man?

959
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:38,519
Farmers.

960
01:17:43,201 --> 01:17:44,165
- That wood?

961
01:17:44,185 --> 01:17:45,149
- Yes.

962
01:17:45,804 --> 01:17:46,682
- Those trees?

963
01:17:46,702 --> 01:17:47,580
- Yes.

964
01:17:47,973 --> 01:17:48,983
- That stream?

965
01:17:49,003 --> 01:17:50,013
- Yes.

966
01:17:50,732 --> 01:18:01,640
Every bit has its history, not just the fields and rice paddies, someone's Great-Great Grandpa planted it, or cleared it, gathered firewood or picked mushrooms there.

967
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:04,041
I see.

968
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,544
Mankind battles nature and receives from it.

969
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:12,643
They evolve together, and create this scenery.

970
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:17,317
So without man, this wouldn't exist?

971
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:23,091
Farmers can't exist without nature.

972
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:31,463
So they've always taken great care to give her a helping hand in return.

973
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:37,535
A collaboration between man and nature...

974
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:40,646
That's the heart of country life.

975
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:45,750
That's why I feel so at home.

976
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:48,887
I didn't grow up here, but somehow always felt...

977
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:53,620
my soul was at home here.

978
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:58,828
So that's it...

979
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,274
My back aches.

980
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:55,088
What's so great about organic farming?

981
01:19:56,334 --> 01:19:58,663
Only the theory.

982
01:19:58,683 --> 01:20:01,012
Like I said...

983
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:04,621
giving nature a hand is hard work.

984
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:08,126
Things haven't changed in a hundred years.

985
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:12,873
No, even "organic" rice uses weed-killer.

986
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:17,877
There's not enough labor to weed by hand.

987
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,140
You're really working hard.

988
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:26,384
How about some tea?

989
01:20:26,788 --> 01:20:28,517
Fantastic.

990
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,288
I felt like a break.

991
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:43,934
Toshio let me try a variety of things...

992
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:49,341
...until I felt I knew all about country life.

993
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,032
That's great...

994
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:41,414
"Behold, the crows fly home.

995
01:21:41,434 --> 01:21:43,678
First one..."

996
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:49,198
At last I can say this in the right setting.

997
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:56,002
It was my line in a school play.

998
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,306
I was "Village Child A".

999
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,948
Oh, I see.

1000
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:05,446
I only ever had small roles too.

1001
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:06,781
And you Naoko?

1002
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:12,224
Only lead roles, since there are so few of us.

1003
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:17,230
These days people leave and go to the cities.

1004
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:21,769
And now there are fewer kids.

1005
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:24,374
I see.

1006
01:22:24,394 --> 01:22:26,888
But getting the big roles must be fun.

1007
01:22:27,085 --> 01:22:28,942
Not really.

1008
01:22:28,962 --> 01:22:30,819
I prefer sports.

1009
01:22:30,839 --> 01:22:32,696
I'm a pretty fast runner.

1010
01:22:33,158 --> 01:22:34,902
Good for you.

1011
01:22:34,922 --> 01:22:36,666
I was always mediocre.

1012
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:44,324
The sports version of "Village Child A" Still, I'll never forget that line as long as I live.

1013
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:48,986
It was going to make me a star.

1014
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:50,064
A star?

1015
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:51,154
Yes.

1016
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:52,425
What kind of star?

1017
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:53,865
That tiny role?

1018
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:55,358
Yes.

1019
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:58,130
Even though you weren't the lead?

1020
01:22:58,506 --> 01:22:59,268
Yes.

1021
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:01,638
Because I was the most enthusiastic.

1022
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:04,868
Cause you were the cutest?

1023
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:07,506
No, not that!

1024
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:10,879
I rehearsed endlessly in front of the mirror.

1025
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:14,280
Even for "Village Child A"...

1026
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:20,361
The line was so short, I felt something missing.

1027
01:23:20,638 --> 01:23:23,019
"Behold, the crows fly home.

1028
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:25,420
First one..."

1029
01:23:25,543 --> 01:23:26,689
I know.

1030
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:27,855
You made up more!

1031
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:29,668
Exactly.

1032
01:23:31,473 --> 01:23:37,070
Look up there, the crows fly home.

1033
01:23:38,656 --> 01:23:39,717
- First one...

1034
01:23:39,737 --> 01:23:40,798
- Then two...

1035
01:23:40,925 --> 01:23:42,037
- Then three...

1036
01:23:42,057 --> 01:23:43,169
- Then four...

1037
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:46,355
Farewell dear crows.

1038
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:48,101
You take care now.

1039
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,819
And your teacher loved it.

1040
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:54,724
Just the opposite.

1041
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:57,222
Very good everyone.

1042
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:03,103
But let's stick to the script.

1043
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:16,842
after all that.

1044
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:21,047
It wasn't a good line, so I didn't mind.

1045
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:24,721
I wasn't discouraged at all.

1046
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:30,054
I realized that I could act even when there were no lines.

1047
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:38,199
Behold, the crows fly home.

1048
01:24:43,221 --> 01:24:44,316
- First one.

1049
01:24:44,336 --> 01:24:45,431
- Then two.

1050
01:24:45,557 --> 01:24:46,652
- Then three.

1051
01:24:46,672 --> 01:24:47,767
- Then four.

1052
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:10,932
That was all.

1053
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:16,637
It was worth the effort. "Village Child A" was a hit.

1054
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:18,905
Believe it or not.

1055
01:25:19,591 --> 01:25:22,689
People asked if I'd had lessons.

1056
01:25:22,709 --> 01:25:25,807
Teachers praised me...

1057
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:29,586
Then something amazing happened.

1058
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:34,594
Anyone home?

1059
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:35,555
Coming.

1060
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:41,033
...and then the dynamite blew up right in my face!

1061
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,728
...right in my face!

1062
01:25:43,448 --> 01:25:44,173
What?

1063
01:25:44,193 --> 01:25:44,918
Our Taeko?

1064
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:54,643
We need a girl to star in our college play.

1065
01:25:56,484 --> 01:26:02,480
As a service to the community, please let your daughter perform.

1066
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:04,021
A star!

1067
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:07,723
We'd rehearse Saturday afternoons.

1068
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:10,690
We wouldn't take too long.

1069
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:13,596
Well, but...

1070
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:17,235
Of course we'd bring her straight home.

1071
01:26:17,772 --> 01:26:19,501
I'll be in a real play.

1072
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:23,703
Not with a bunch of kids but with real grown-ups!

1073
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:25,439
I'll be a star!

1074
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:41,325
Oh, oh, oh, oh what a wonderful day Cock-a-doodle-doo!

1075
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:56,009
Mother!

1076
01:26:56,955 --> 01:26:57,583
So?

1077
01:26:57,603 --> 01:26:58,231
So?

1078
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:02,177
A nice boy from the university wants you in their drama.

1079
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:05,911
You were so good in the school play.

1080
01:27:06,297 --> 01:27:07,011
And?

1081
01:27:07,031 --> 01:27:07,745
And?

1082
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:12,923
He practically begged me!

1083
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,199
Wow that's great!

1084
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:24,567
At least you're good at something.

1085
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:27,402
She writes good essays too.

1086
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:32,411
She's certainly better at that than she is at math.

1087
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:33,701
That's right.

1088
01:27:33,721 --> 01:27:34,532
That's right.

1089
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:39,916
I was lead in "The Poor Sparrow" but no one came for me.

1090
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:41,951
You see, you see!

1091
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,255
Are you going to do it?

1092
01:28:07,815 --> 01:28:11,012
This could lead to a career.

1093
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,050
Join the Takarazuka Theater.

1094
01:28:14,155 --> 01:28:17,556
Start rehearsing now, it's perfect timing.

1095
01:28:18,826 --> 01:28:20,726
Acting is out.

1096
01:28:22,063 --> 01:28:24,623
Show business people are no good.

1097
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,267
"Show business"... don't exaggerate...

1098
01:28:28,379 --> 01:28:29,593
That's right.

1099
01:28:29,613 --> 01:28:30,827
It's...

1100
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:32,269
I said no.

1101
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:33,833
Dinner.

1102
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:56,720
Father's so stubborn.

1103
01:28:56,964 --> 01:29:00,764
Why did you have to mention a career?

1104
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:02,439
- Can I bathe first?

1105
01:29:02,459 --> 01:29:04,020
- Sure.

1106
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:06,835
Or Takarazuka...?

1107
01:29:07,485 --> 01:29:09,229
Or show business?

1108
01:29:09,249 --> 01:29:10,993
You know Dad...

1109
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:15,512
Why did you say that Nanako?

1110
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:17,646
That's enough.

1111
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:31,656
Poor boy, poor boy, Don't you feel sorry for me?

1112
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:35,063
We won't take much of her time.

1113
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:37,702
I know but...

1114
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,970
I beg you.

1115
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:45,575
She's rather shy...

1116
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:49,914
the timid type...

1117
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:56,517
Sorry you came so far for nothing.

1118
01:29:56,624 --> 01:30:01,823
Poor boy, poor boy...

1119
01:30:01,939 --> 01:30:04,268
....

1120
01:30:04,288 --> 01:30:06,617
Such a long way from home...

1121
01:30:07,101 --> 01:30:25,950
Poor boy Aoki's going to play the part instead.

1122
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:27,580
I see.

1123
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:32,757
She's boasting to everyone.

1124
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:33,894
I see.

1125
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:41,893
Today her Mom met her at school to get her changed into a fancy dress.

1126
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:45,230
A frilly thing out to here...

1127
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:52,440
Don't tell anyone you got the first offer.

1128
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:58,483
Because that would hurt Aoki very much.

1129
01:31:03,491 --> 01:31:04,583
Do you understand?

1130
01:31:07,929 --> 01:31:08,827
Do you understand?

1131
01:31:39,403 --> 01:31:47,570
Breaking through the waves Shooting through the clouds Where is it heading, Hyokkori Pumpkin Island?

1132
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:55,757
Where will it take us?

1133
01:32:00,581 --> 01:32:24,103
Something special waits for us, just over the horizon There 'll be hard times, there 'll be sad times, but we'll never lose heart We hate to cry, so let's laugh instead Let's go!

1134
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:29,472
Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!

1135
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:49,795
Poor you.

1136
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:56,135
I joined the drama group in high school.

1137
01:32:56,571 --> 01:33:00,701
I couldn't forget what had happened.

1138
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:02,040
And then?

1139
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:06,177
It was a lot of fun, acting and all...

1140
01:33:07,291 --> 01:33:09,751
but it wasn't for me.

1141
01:33:09,771 --> 01:33:12,231
As for becoming a star...

1142
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:14,446
that was a joke.

1143
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:15,954
But...

1144
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:22,525
I guess Dads are the same all over.

1145
01:33:24,465 --> 01:33:28,595
When I was in high school, I so wanted to live in Tokyo.

1146
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:36,538
I even wrote to my cousin about schools there.

1147
01:33:37,478 --> 01:33:39,207
Did you really?

1148
01:33:40,524 --> 01:33:44,204
I gave up.

1149
01:33:44,224 --> 01:33:47,904
But it annoyed me to hear other guys bragging about life in Tokyo.

1150
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,114
Not anymore though.

1151
01:33:51,134 --> 01:33:53,048
I respect my dad...

1152
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,219
He's an expert farmer.

1153
01:33:57,398 --> 01:34:00,060
But I know how you felt.

1154
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:02,761
Mine's just a funny story.

1155
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:04,997
No it's the same, I understand.

1156
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:14,078
But we'll never lose heart, we hate to cry, so let's laugh instead.

1157
01:34:14,615 --> 01:34:16,742
I also watched Hyokkori Pumpkin Island.

1158
01:34:17,118 --> 01:34:18,016
Really?

1159
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:20,621
Machine Gun Dandy was so cool.

1160
01:34:20,721 --> 01:34:22,552
He was my hero!

1161
01:34:23,557 --> 01:34:25,184
Of course.

1162
01:34:25,292 --> 01:34:28,853
Those songs were full of encouragement.

1163
01:34:28,963 --> 01:34:31,557
What was that other one...?

1164
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:49,277
"If today's no good, you'll have tomorrow" "If tomorrow's no good, you'll have the next day" "If that's no good, there'll be another" "There's always a tomorrow" What a weird song!

1165
01:34:51,686 --> 01:35:00,551
That song, about putting things off, Toshio took in a positive, affirmative way.

1166
01:35:01,328 --> 01:35:04,957
I liked his approach to life.

1167
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,778
You're going tomorrow?

1168
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:28,514
Thank you for having me for so long.

1169
01:35:28,622 --> 01:35:30,556
Thank you, my dear.

1170
01:35:36,831 --> 01:35:40,358
Do you like it here?

1171
01:35:40,478 --> 01:35:42,659
Very much.

1172
01:35:42,679 --> 01:35:44,860
I feel so at home.

1173
01:35:44,972 --> 01:35:48,464
Glad to hear it.

1174
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:52,106
I've lived here all my life.

1175
01:35:52,523 --> 01:35:55,353
Been to Tokyo just once.

1176
01:35:55,373 --> 01:35:58,203
For your sister's wedding.

1177
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:01,345
You think it's better than Tokyo?

1178
01:36:01,722 --> 01:36:03,656
Without a doubt.

1179
01:36:03,968 --> 01:36:06,747
Tokyo's packed with cars, buildings...

1180
01:36:06,767 --> 01:36:09,546
People shouldn't live like that.

1181
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:12,961
This is a different world.

1182
01:36:13,067 --> 01:36:17,333
You really like it here then?

1183
01:36:17,448 --> 01:36:19,578
Yes.

1184
01:36:19,598 --> 01:36:21,728
The nice surroundings, the kind people...

1185
01:36:25,246 --> 01:36:26,873
Taeko.

1186
01:36:27,725 --> 01:36:29,536
Why don't you live here?

1187
01:36:29,556 --> 01:36:31,367
With Toshio?

1188
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:44,960
Since his brother moved to Tokyo, why don't you stay here and marry Toshio?

1189
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:46,362
Granny!

1190
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:49,766
Mother... you've gone too far!

1191
01:36:49,904 --> 01:36:52,372
Taeko's shocked.

1192
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:55,840
Please think it over.

1193
01:36:56,654 --> 01:36:57,697
Don't pay any attention.

1194
01:36:57,717 --> 01:36:58,760
She's joking.

1195
01:36:59,446 --> 01:37:01,209
Joking, right, Granny?

1196
01:37:01,325 --> 01:37:02,636
No.

1197
01:37:02,656 --> 01:37:03,967
I'm serious.

1198
01:37:04,084 --> 01:37:06,746
Don't deny you wouldn't like it.

1199
01:37:06,854 --> 01:37:11,086
It's not a matter of what we'd like...

1200
01:37:11,192 --> 01:37:13,956
Of course we'd love it.

1201
01:37:14,061 --> 01:37:19,556
But Taeko's a city person.

1202
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:20,691
Of course.

1203
01:37:20,801 --> 01:37:29,376
But she loves it here, she works so hard on the land, it's a joy to watch.

1204
01:37:29,543 --> 01:37:33,877
There'd be nothing better than her marrying Toshio.

1205
01:37:33,991 --> 01:37:35,951
You're being rude.

1206
01:37:35,971 --> 01:37:37,931
You're embarrasing her.

1207
01:37:38,629 --> 01:37:41,243
She's got a decent job in Tokyo.

1208
01:37:41,263 --> 01:37:43,877
Besides, she's older than him.

1209
01:37:43,991 --> 01:37:47,984
There are jobs in Yamagata too.

1210
01:37:49,463 --> 01:37:52,694
Please don't be angry.

1211
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:57,527
Most of the young wives work these days, so...

1212
01:37:57,638 --> 01:38:00,937
What're you talking about?

1213
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:06,210
She's only been here twice on holiday.

1214
01:38:06,447 --> 01:38:09,007
Suddenly bringing this up... you're upsetting her.

1215
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:11,209
So you're against it?

1216
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:13,589
I didn't say that.

1217
01:38:13,609 --> 01:38:15,870
I said let's be realistic.

1218
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:20,359
We don't even know how Toshio feels.

1219
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:23,430
One look at him and it's obvious.

1220
01:38:23,530 --> 01:38:29,298
Don't dismiss it before we've asked her.

1221
01:38:30,004 --> 01:38:31,596
Taeko!

1222
01:38:37,244 --> 01:38:38,973
Let her be.

1223
01:38:41,492 --> 01:38:43,719
See what you did.

1224
01:38:43,739 --> 01:38:45,966
You can't rush these things.

1225
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:49,780
I don't think I was wrong.

1226
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:09,033
I'd never even thought of being a farmer's wife.

1227
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:15,773
I was strangely moved, even imagining it might be possible.

1228
01:39:17,051 --> 01:39:23,813
If only I could've replied: "I'd love to... ." like in a movie.

1229
01:39:24,925 --> 01:39:26,483
But I couldn't.

1230
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:34,626
Suddenly my love of the country, and my play-farming, seemed so phony.

1231
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:43,776
Declaring my love for country life based on a ten day vacation, now felt so embarrassing.

1232
01:39:45,446 --> 01:39:48,074
Then with no warning....

1233
01:39:49,316 --> 01:39:51,910
everyone seeing right through me.

1234
01:39:53,487 --> 01:39:55,250
It was unbearable.

1235
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:03,853
I ain't shaking hands with you.

1236
01:40:06,967 --> 01:40:09,800
That shirt he wore today....

1237
01:40:09,903 --> 01:40:10,631
What about it?

1238
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:13,468
Tanaka 's old shirt.

1239
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:14,937
Don't tell anyone.

1240
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:20,742
When it's his turn to feed the ducks, he takes the bread home.

1241
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:24,215
Did you see his hands?

1242
01:40:24,318 --> 01:40:26,115
Glad he's not sitting next to me.

1243
01:40:26,787 --> 01:40:28,254
Poor Taeko.

1244
01:40:28,355 --> 01:40:30,789
Have him switch places.

1245
01:40:30,891 --> 01:40:34,486
He should sit with the boys.

1246
01:40:34,595 --> 01:40:36,153
Right Taeko?

1247
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:40,125
I don't mind.

1248
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:42,597
You shouldn't talk like that.

1249
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:44,428
You don't mind?

1250
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:46,165
Don't be a goody-goody.

1251
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:49,609
Don't you dare tell anyone what we said.

1252
01:40:54,348 --> 01:40:55,940
I'll beat you up!

1253
01:41:03,323 --> 01:41:04,585
Don't go!

1254
01:41:17,504 --> 01:41:19,233
What are you doing out here?

1255
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:21,494
Nothing.

1256
01:41:21,514 --> 01:41:23,058
Taking a walk.

1257
01:41:23,187 --> 01:41:25,431
You're getting wet.

1258
01:41:25,451 --> 01:41:27,695
Quick, get in.

1259
01:41:44,164 --> 01:41:45,893
A little souvenir.

1260
01:41:46,834 --> 01:41:48,392
Some of Mom's pickles.

1261
01:41:55,275 --> 01:41:57,539
Please don't go back yet.

1262
01:41:57,644 --> 01:41:58,975
Why not?

1263
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:02,276
Just drive... anywhere.

1264
01:42:02,816 --> 01:42:04,283
Something wrong?

1265
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:09,656
I knew a boy named Abe.

1266
01:42:11,268 --> 01:42:13,364
He came from another school.

1267
01:42:13,384 --> 01:42:15,480
He sat next to me.

1268
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:22,425
He once said, "I ain't shaking hands with you."

1269
01:42:47,471 --> 01:42:50,404
His family was poor.

1270
01:42:50,424 --> 01:42:53,357
He never had sports gear.

1271
01:42:54,268 --> 01:42:58,932
Always picking his nose or wiping it on his sleeve...

1272
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:08,345
And if I complained or even dared frown at him, he'd threaten to hit me.

1273
01:43:09,993 --> 01:43:13,672
I hated it.

1274
01:43:13,692 --> 01:43:17,371
I longed for the end of the term, so we could change seats.

1275
01:43:18,959 --> 01:43:28,264
I hated holding hands in dance class, hated having to lend him my homework.

1276
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:36,138
The girls gossiped and called him names.

1277
01:43:37,544 --> 01:43:41,947
But I wouldn't join in.

1278
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:47,217
I thought it was terrible to talk behind his back.

1279
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:50,281
But one day...

1280
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:55,787
He was transferred in the middle of the term.

1281
01:43:56,830 --> 01:44:01,529
The teacher made us all shake hands and say goodbye.

1282
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:06,301
A feeling of disgust swept the room.

1283
01:44:08,842 --> 01:44:12,972
His hands were filthy.

1284
01:44:14,948 --> 01:44:22,746
Walking around, shaking hands with us, he looked so nervous.

1285
01:44:25,459 --> 01:44:30,226
Back at his own desk, only I was left.

1286
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:41,831
When I held out my hand he said, "I ain't shaking hands with you."

1287
01:44:44,945 --> 01:44:47,345
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

1288
01:44:55,555 --> 01:44:59,218
I hated him the most.

1289
01:45:01,228 --> 01:45:04,493
He knew that.

1290
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:08,165
That's why he didn't shake my hand.

1291
01:45:15,709 --> 01:45:17,836
What happened at the farmhouse?

1292
01:45:18,512 --> 01:45:23,211
Ever since I was little...

1293
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:27,245
I just pretend to be nice.

1294
01:45:28,255 --> 01:45:29,722
Nothing's changed.

1295
01:45:40,844 --> 01:45:42,622
You're strange, today.

1296
01:45:42,642 --> 01:45:44,420
Not the usual you.

1297
01:45:47,274 --> 01:45:49,572
I don't know what happened, but...

1298
01:45:49,743 --> 01:45:53,577
It's nothing to do with that.

1299
01:45:57,784 --> 01:45:59,251
I'm sorry.

1300
01:46:00,654 --> 01:46:05,819
I just feel bad about what happened.

1301
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:12,662
I think that boy was stupid.

1302
01:46:12,999 --> 01:46:17,834
Maybe he didn't shake your hand because he liked you.

1303
01:46:17,938 --> 01:46:22,500
No, he liked the class president.

1304
01:46:22,642 --> 01:46:24,610
He was always acting tough with me.

1305
01:46:24,711 --> 01:46:35,084
Hands in pockets, spitting, swearing, swaggering along, ...showing off.

1306
01:46:35,188 --> 01:46:36,712
Exactly.

1307
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,146
I know how he feels.

1308
01:46:40,166 --> 01:46:43,312
When I was little, I used to bully the girl I liked.

1309
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:45,227
That's not it.

1310
01:46:45,332 --> 01:46:49,769
He shook hands with everyone but me.

1311
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:53,103
There's the problem.

1312
01:46:54,007 --> 01:46:56,771
Girls never understand how boys feel.

1313
01:46:57,511 --> 01:46:59,411
As if you know...

1314
01:46:59,846 --> 01:47:02,041
Let me guess, then...

1315
01:47:02,849 --> 01:47:06,182
He wasn't that tough.

1316
01:47:06,730 --> 01:47:09,395
He couldn't bully any boys.

1317
01:47:09,415 --> 01:47:12,080
He had no friends.

1318
01:47:14,795 --> 01:47:19,664
You sat next to him, an easy target.

1319
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:23,292
He needed you to be tough with.

1320
01:47:23,403 --> 01:47:27,339
No way he wanted to shake hands with everyone.

1321
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:32,845
He could only prove how tough he was with you.

1322
01:47:58,338 --> 01:48:00,363
Don't be filthy!

1323
01:48:44,718 --> 01:48:52,555
I felt so guilty and so sorry for him that I began copying him.

1324
01:48:54,728 --> 01:48:56,628
Too late though, huh?

1325
01:48:56,830 --> 01:49:02,834
I couldn't take back the pain I caused him.

1326
01:49:11,645 --> 01:49:14,637
It's stopped raining.

1327
01:49:15,282 --> 01:49:16,909
Oh, yes.

1328
01:49:21,688 --> 01:49:23,280
The moon's out.

1329
01:49:33,633 --> 01:49:37,501
Sometimes at night you see raccoons here.

1330
01:49:39,773 --> 01:49:41,001
Shall we go back?

1331
01:49:41,107 --> 01:49:45,203
They must be worried about me.

1332
01:49:48,381 --> 01:49:51,976
This'll be the talk of the town.

1333
01:49:52,462 --> 01:49:54,222
I'm sorry.

1334
01:49:54,242 --> 01:49:56,002
You've been so kind.

1335
01:49:56,856 --> 01:49:59,586
I wonder what happened at the house, though?

1336
01:49:59,693 --> 01:50:04,494
Please, for my sake, don't ask anyone.

1337
01:50:08,201 --> 01:50:10,431
Shall I play that music?

1338
01:50:49,175 --> 01:50:58,448
I began to think of my feelings for him, and of his feelings for me, for the very first time.

1339
01:51:02,422 --> 01:51:08,691
How come he seemed to sort out my mixed-up thoughts?

1340
01:51:09,429 --> 01:51:13,991
How come I let him get so close?

1341
01:51:15,535 --> 01:51:19,596
Somehow he seemed older than me.

1342
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:27,006
He was the one I wanted to shake hands with.

1343
01:51:29,716 --> 01:51:31,308
Just shake hands?

1344
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:05,550
What was this feeling?

1345
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:11,357
My mind raced as I sat beside him.

1346
01:52:38,351 --> 01:52:40,410
Have you got everything?

1347
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,249
Yes, I'm fine.

1348
01:52:42,455 --> 01:52:44,650
We'll see you in the winter.

1349
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:48,626
I'll do my farming homework.

1350
01:52:48,728 --> 01:52:50,992
What about skiing?

1351
01:52:51,397 --> 01:52:53,763
That just takes practice.

1352
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:57,497
Consider what I said, Taeko.

1353
01:52:57,771 --> 01:52:59,068
What's that?

1354
01:52:59,172 --> 01:52:59,900
What?

1355
01:53:00,306 --> 01:53:04,106
That's our secret.

1356
01:53:04,744 --> 01:53:08,043
Something was strange yesterday.

1357
01:53:08,158 --> 01:53:11,289
Sorry.

1358
01:53:11,309 --> 01:53:14,440
Next time I'll be fine, I'll leave the ten year-old me, at home.

1359
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:29,496
Wait for me!

1360
01:53:30,737 --> 01:53:32,568
Take care Naoko.

1361
01:53:41,881 --> 01:53:43,246
Goodbye.

1362
01:54:23,523 --> 01:54:37,494
Some say love, it is a river that drowns the tender reed.

1363
01:54:39,272 --> 01:54:53,911
Some say love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed.

1364
01:54:55,321 --> 01:55:09,929
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need.

1365
01:55:11,437 --> 01:55:26,541
I say love, it is a flower, and you its only seed.

1366
01:55:31,524 --> 01:55:45,967
It's the heart, afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance.

1367
01:55:46,806 --> 01:56:01,277
It's the dream, afraid of waking, that never takes a chance.

1368
01:56:02,155 --> 01:56:09,118
It's the one who won't be taken.

1369
01:56:10,330 --> 01:56:17,293
Who cannot seem to give.

1370
01:56:18,371 --> 01:56:34,081
And the soul, afraid of dyin', that never learns to live.

1371
01:56:38,057 --> 01:57:23,660
When the night has been too Ionely and the road has been too long, And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong, Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows.

1372
01:57:25,171 --> 01:57:42,247
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love, in the Spring becomes the Rose.

1373
01:58:18,524 --> 01:58:38,834
