00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,523
Good morning.

3
00:03:14,543 --> 00:03:15,858
Is Sora up yet?

4
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:17,911
Still in front of the mirror.

5
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:20,288
Morning.

6
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:25,752
Night shift again?

7
00:03:26,294 --> 00:03:27,921
And tonight too.

8
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:30,882
Shall I save dinner for you?

9
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:32,884
Yes, thanks.

10
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:35,178
That's real service.

11
00:03:35,897 --> 00:03:37,482
- The hospital's short-handed.

12
00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:39,087
- I got a hole in my sock!

13
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:41,267
Leave it by the sewing machine.

14
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:42,936
More holes?

15
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:45,438
My socks keep shrinking.

16
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,190
This is for you.

17
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:50,109
Pack me a jumbo lunch.

18
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:52,737
Don't you eat enough already?

19
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:54,896
- Here Riku, have my fried egg.

20
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,564
- All right!

21
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:58,191
You need it more, Dr.

22
00:03:58,211 --> 00:03:59,526
Hokuto.

23
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,956
Who's the doctor here?

24
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,752
You drown everything in soy sauce.

25
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:08,951
- I like it that way.

26
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:09,993
- Me too.

27
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:16,135
Breakfast is ready, Hiro.

28
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:19,806
Good morning, Hana.

29
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:21,432
Good morning.

30
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:29,732
You can share your mother's.

31
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:31,141
Thanks.

32
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:33,778
Can I make you some tea?

33
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:35,989
No thanks, I've had some.

34
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:40,910
Good morning.

35
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:46,406
Thanks.

36
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,340
Please go ahead, everyone.

37
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:56,009
Let's eat!

38
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,670
You're late.

39
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,516
I can't get my hair right.

40
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:06,519
You look very pretty.

41
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,139
I'm starving.

42
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:12,702
Evening rounds again, Dr.

43
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:13,932
Hokuto?

44
00:06:14,212 --> 00:06:15,421
See you tomorrow.

45
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:16,788
Bye.

46
00:06:40,863 --> 00:06:42,365
Good morning, Tomoko.

47
00:06:44,242 --> 00:06:45,576
Need a lift?

48
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:47,193
- Thanks, I'll walk.

49
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:48,611
- Suit yourself.

50
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:50,724
- Can you hang the laundry?

51
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,003
- Of course.

52
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:53,282
See you this afternoon.

53
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:54,919
Bye, then.

54
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:19,184
KONAN ACADEMY There she is.

55
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:22,321
Look what's in the school paper.

56
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:24,251
There's a poem about you.

57
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:26,065
Who else raises flags every morning?

58
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:32,676
'Fair girl, why do you send Your thoughts to the sky?' 'The wind carries them aloft To mingle with the crows. ' 'Trimmed with blue, Your flags fly again today. ' See?

59
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:38,745
It must be about you.

60
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:40,130
I guess.

61
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:42,425
So it's about you.

62
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:45,344
Try a note in a bottle next time.

63
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:48,514
Back off Math Club creep!

64
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:51,225
He practically lives at the clubhouse.

65
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:54,520
All rise!

66
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:01,810
- We grabbed a table.

67
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,145
- See you there.

68
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,369
Nobuko, over here!

69
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:12,591
- I'm famished.

70
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:13,863
- What, curry udon again?

71
00:08:14,258 --> 00:08:15,559
Why not?

72
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,880
I like it.

73
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,201
Anyway, you're one to talk.

74
00:08:18,387 --> 00:08:19,118
So?

75
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:19,869
I like bread.

76
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:22,048
Umi's lunches look so good.

77
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,383
You should try making your own.

78
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,221
I could, I just don't have enough time.

79
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:34,060
What are those guys up to now?

80
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,417
All right, drop the banners.

81
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:04,423
LATIN QUARTER ANTI-DEMOLITION LEAGUE Go.

82
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:39,333
Go for it!

83
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,130
Look this way, you guys.

84
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:51,470
That was cool.

85
00:09:52,388 --> 00:09:53,598
Are you okay?

86
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:55,965
So stupid...

87
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:03,368
- I'm home.

88
00:10:03,388 --> 00:10:04,640
- Welcome back.

89
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:06,830
- Thanks, Tomoko.

90
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,227
- My pleasure.

91
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:12,992
That should do it.

92
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:15,494
Today's fish was really cheap.

93
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,528
Thanks.

94
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:18,946
I think I'll deep fry it.

95
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:21,959
I have to see Grandmother.

96
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:30,603
Grandmother?

97
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:31,249
It's me.

98
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:32,928
Come in.

99
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:47,329
In the black again this month.

100
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:49,185
You're managing things beautifully.

101
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:54,075
Only because you're covering Tomoko's wages for us.

102
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:55,618
It's nothing.

103
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:59,830
I'd have hired her anyway, even without the boarders.

104
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:02,875
But isn't this too much work for you?

105
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:06,712
I worry sometimes.

106
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:11,050
It doesn't feel so lonely with everyone here.

107
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,333
I know.

108
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:13,167
But still...

109
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:18,224
It makes me so sad, watching you raise those flags every day.

110
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:22,520
No one knows how much you miss your father.

111
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:25,481
I hope you find someone wonderful soon.

112
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:28,526
Then you won't need those flags anymore.

113
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:31,241
- Mrs.

114
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,131
Matsuzaki?

115
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:33,021
- Come in.

116
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:36,701
I'm finished for the day.

117
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:38,536
Thank you, Tomoko.

118
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:43,541
I should get dinner going.

119
00:12:50,357 --> 00:12:52,485
That was quite a stunt.

120
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:54,195
No kidding.

121
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:58,657
Some of the girls are even starting a fan club.

122
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:00,326
What's his name?

123
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:01,880
Shun Kazama.

124
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,277
He's a live wire.

125
00:13:03,464 --> 00:13:05,071
- The electrician's son?

126
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:06,698
- Hiro, you're so dense.

127
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:57,049
'Fair girl, why do you send Your thoughts to the sky?' Thus the Principality of Wallachia was hemmed in...

128
00:13:57,216 --> 00:14:02,888
by the Ottoman Turks and Russia, and its territory was coveted by both.

129
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:15,733
SAVE OUR CLUBHOUSE FROM DEMOLITION Umi!

130
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:16,600
Sora?

131
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,476
What's going on?

132
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:22,032
I bought this for 30 yen.

133
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:26,745
30 yen just for that?

134
00:14:26,964 --> 00:14:28,571
Isn't he cool?

135
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:30,198
I've got to have his autograph.

136
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:32,512
Please come with me.

137
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:34,577
I've never been inside the clubhouse.

138
00:14:34,763 --> 00:14:35,911
Neither have I.

139
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:37,079
I'm not going in there.

140
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:38,121
- Please!

141
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:39,038
- No way.

142
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:44,263
Come on, just this once.

143
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:45,755
Come on...

144
00:14:49,268 --> 00:15:13,374
DON'T DEMOLISH OUR CLUBHOUSE Read)/-7 Excuse me?

145
00:15:13,385 --> 00:15:15,659
- Today's spots are very distinct!

146
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,953
- And they form a straight line.

147
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:20,341
A textbook magnetic field.

148
00:15:20,507 --> 00:15:21,707
Excuse me.

149
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:22,759
What?

150
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,638
We're looking for the school newspaper office.

151
00:15:25,804 --> 00:15:28,641
Third floor, same room as the Archaeology Club.

152
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:30,258
Thanks.

153
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:49,286
Don't they ever clean this place?

154
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:11,517
Hey.

155
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:14,478
Hi, we're looking for the Archaeology Club.

156
00:16:14,697 --> 00:16:16,345
Upstairs.

157
00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:18,013
Look for the Lit Club sign.

158
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:19,525
Thanks.

159
00:16:31,286 --> 00:16:32,830
At last, inquiring minds!

160
00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:35,541
The Philosophy Club wants you.

161
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:38,617
New members!

162
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:40,035
How long has it been?

163
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:42,923
My struggle was not in vain.

164
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:47,845
We're just heading for the Archaeology Lit Club, actually.

165
00:16:48,022 --> 00:16:49,941
Now don't be shy.

166
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:51,880
Shall we discuss existentialism?

167
00:16:52,182 --> 00:16:54,560
Or perhaps you prefer Nietzsche?

168
00:16:58,073 --> 00:16:59,471
Chem Club!

169
00:16:59,491 --> 00:17:00,889
How dare you disturb our contemplation?

170
00:17:01,118 --> 00:17:02,933
Better run, you guys.

171
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:04,768
You'll be there all day.

172
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:08,282
Show some respect, you second-rate alchemists.

173
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:10,316
At least we do experiments.

174
00:17:10,336 --> 00:17:12,235
Your ideas can't even be proved.

175
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:17,434
'New poets!

176
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:22,300
Draw energy from clouds, light, storms... ' 'Show us the direction humanity should take... ' 'A Copernicus for a new age, to set us free... ' CQ!

177
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,166
CQ!

178
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,762
This is a high school student from Japan.

179
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:58,656
LITERATURE CLUB LATIN QUARTER WEEKLY This is it.

180
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:03,628
Matsuzaki.

181
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:04,963
Yamazaki...

182
00:18:05,182 --> 00:18:06,642
Hey,Shun!

183
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:08,122
Couple of VIPs to see you.

184
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:15,714
Welcome to the Lit Club.

185
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:17,549
Or was it the Archaeology Club?

186
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:22,022
Don't tell me you're here about that rag we publish.

187
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:23,701
Knock it off, Mizunuma.

188
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:25,223
Come in and close the...

189
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:31,406
They'll shut us down!

190
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,795
We're down to two members.

191
00:18:33,815 --> 00:18:36,027
The Archaeology Club is doomed.

192
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:42,668
Can you sign this?

193
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:45,337
Do it for her, hero.

194
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:57,516
Thank you!

195
00:18:57,766 --> 00:18:58,966
Your hand...

196
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:01,573
Just a cat scratch.

197
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:03,513
This isn't from the jump.

198
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:06,275
A cat...?

199
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,362
Wait, could you cut some stencils for Shun?

200
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:15,450
We're all pretty busy with the anti-demolition campaign.

201
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:16,994
You're the little sister?

202
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:19,371
Yes, I'm Sora Matsuzaki.

203
00:19:19,673 --> 00:19:21,425
You help them, Umi.

204
00:19:21,445 --> 00:19:23,197
My handwriting is terrible.

205
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,887
You're joking.

206
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:26,284
Why should I...

207
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:28,338
PHYSICS MIDTERM FORECAST!

208
00:19:28,724 --> 00:19:30,039
You're a junior.

209
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,374
Got Suzuki for physics?

210
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:33,516
Suzuki?

211
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:34,116
Yes.

212
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:35,971
Then you need this.

213
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,850
Mizunuma's exam forecasts are usually spot on.

214
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:41,967
But not guaranteed.

215
00:19:41,987 --> 00:19:43,927
Bring your own luck to the test.

216
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:47,983
See you at six.

217
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:50,527
Shall we go?

218
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:52,144
Oh, yes!

219
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:59,578
Miss Matsuzaki, I'd better see you out.

220
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:02,039
Our resident philosopher might ambush you.

221
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:03,749
Oh, thank you!

222
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,770
From here to the end.

223
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:40,410
We've got to do something.

224
00:20:40,661 --> 00:20:44,039
Yes, for the honor of those who went before us!

225
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:30,794
Meeting, Shun.

226
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:33,161
Care to join us, Matsuzaki?

227
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:35,163
It's the anti-demolition meeting.

228
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:37,092
Is it that late?

229
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:38,459
I finished.

230
00:21:38,802 --> 00:21:41,096
Thanks, that really helps.

231
00:21:42,306 --> 00:21:44,016
Meeting!

232
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:47,071
All hands on deck.

233
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:49,719
Time for today's meeting.

234
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:44,650
I'm home.  Hi, Umi.

235
00:22:44,753 --> 00:22:45,970
I'm running late.

236
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,207
Let's do curry.

237
00:22:47,227 --> 00:22:48,444
Can you cut the vegetables?

238
00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:50,082
Sure.

239
00:23:08,485 --> 00:23:09,653
- I'm back.

240
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:10,841
- We were waiting.

241
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:12,970
Riku, I need some pork.

242
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,889
Can you run down for me?

243
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:17,401
What, right now?

244
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:19,602
Sora?

245
00:23:20,153 --> 00:23:22,614
But the program just started.

246
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,409
You didn't ask Tomoko to get some?

247
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:28,078
I used it for lunches.

248
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:37,254
Start the rice in 10 minutes, okay?

249
00:23:38,713 --> 00:23:40,298
Okay.

250
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:55,137
Shopping?

251
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:56,472
Sort of.

252
00:23:58,285 --> 00:23:59,537
Hop on.

253
00:23:59,557 --> 00:24:00,809
Bottom of the hill, right?

254
00:24:01,621 --> 00:24:03,624
Don't worry, my hand's okay.

255
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:05,647
I can use the brake just fine.

256
00:24:21,506 --> 00:24:23,258
How was your meeting?

257
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:25,177
Still going strong.

258
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,804
But I've got curfew.

259
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,851
Did you finish printing the paper?

260
00:24:33,153 --> 00:24:35,156
You must be kidding.

261
00:24:35,176 --> 00:24:37,179
I'll do it tomorrow before school.

262
00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:42,413
Listen, Shun.

263
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:43,685
Can I ask you something?

264
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:47,741
That poem in the paper...

265
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:57,532
- You were saying?

266
00:24:57,552 --> 00:24:59,075
- No, it's okay.

267
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:12,881
Thanks.

268
00:25:15,477 --> 00:25:17,729
400 grams of sliced pork.

269
00:25:18,522 --> 00:25:19,731
Two to go.

270
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:21,848
- Here you go. 240 yen.

271
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:23,391
- Thanks.

272
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,740
Come again.

273
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:31,233
Thanks.

274
00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:33,235
Dig in.

275
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:37,749
I need energy to get home.

276
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,918
Where's your house?

277
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,597
- By the harbor.

278
00:25:41,617 --> 00:25:42,744
- Gosh, that's far.

279
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:47,541
See you.

280
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:50,762
Thank you!

281
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:03,650
This is nice.

282
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:26,464
Can I come in?

283
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:30,343
Don't you feel well?

284
00:26:35,265 --> 00:26:36,725
Go on ahead, Sora.

285
00:26:37,434 --> 00:26:38,810
I'm coming in.

286
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:52,741
Wow...

287
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:04,347
I shouldn't paint at night.

288
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:06,162
The colors are all wrong.

289
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:09,007
It's beautiful.

290
00:27:10,634 --> 00:27:11,834
What's this?

291
00:27:15,815 --> 00:27:17,651
That tug goes by a lot.

292
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:19,507
I think it's answering your flags.

293
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,021
Guess you can't see the tug from there.

294
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,025
Answering my message?

295
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:37,035
I need food.

296
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,048
Good morning.

297
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:02,613
All printed up.

298
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:03,718
Your handwriting's great.

299
00:28:04,854 --> 00:28:06,231
Thanks.

300
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:08,900
Listen...

301
00:28:14,197 --> 00:28:16,408
Can I help with anything else?

302
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:18,066
Of course.

303
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:22,831
But I can't stay late.

304
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:25,281
I'll give you some stencils.

305
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:27,241
You can transfer copy at home.

306
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:31,245
There's a debate after school.

307
00:28:31,265 --> 00:28:33,205
Why don't you come?

308
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:36,177
Sorry, I'm busy today.

309
00:28:37,303 --> 00:28:38,513
Bye.

310
00:28:45,562 --> 00:28:46,762
Umi, wait!

311
00:28:47,063 --> 00:28:48,263
Let's get ice cream.

312
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:49,607
No club meeting?

313
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:52,402
It was canceled for the debate.

314
00:28:52,662 --> 00:28:54,373
Sorry, Tomoko's off today.

315
00:28:54,393 --> 00:28:56,104
I have to be back early.

316
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,284
Come on everybody, the debate's starting.

317
00:28:59,617 --> 00:29:03,621
RESOLVED: THE LATIN QUARTER SHOULD BE PRESERVED!

318
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:05,874
Good, hold it right there.

319
00:29:08,543 --> 00:29:09,961
This'll get rough.

320
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:16,068
Afternoon.

321
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,472
Heading home?

322
00:29:17,492 --> 00:29:18,876
Got some nice flounder fillets.

323
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:20,972
Okay, I'll take some.

324
00:29:22,442 --> 00:29:24,111
- Your mom back yet?

325
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:25,800
- Not yet.

326
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:27,645
I'll come back later!

327
00:29:27,854 --> 00:29:29,054
What's going on?

328
00:29:34,537 --> 00:29:36,915
We've had peace for nearly 20 years.

329
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:39,313
The Olympics are coming soon.

330
00:29:40,335 --> 00:29:42,817
It's a whole new era.

331
00:29:42,837 --> 00:29:45,319
Japan is changing radically.

332
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:50,168
We must build a new society on the ruins of the old.

333
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:54,172
Tearing down the Latin Quarter...

334
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:57,801
and building a new clubhouse is a historical necessity.

335
00:29:58,176 --> 00:29:59,761
And the students want it.

336
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:01,169
Umi!

337
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:02,713
What's happening?

338
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:04,599
I don't know exactly.

339
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,270
We surveyed the students about the new clubhouse.

340
00:30:09,437 --> 00:30:13,858
80 percent of the student body want to rebuild.

341
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:17,946
I believe we must accept the board's plan!

342
00:30:21,324 --> 00:30:23,701
You're like the old men who run this country...

343
00:30:23,993 --> 00:30:26,663
just blindly following the crowd.

344
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:28,154
Silence!

345
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:29,155
I have the floor.

346
00:30:29,592 --> 00:30:31,720
Who cares about percentages when you're wrong?

347
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,868
Blockheads!

348
00:30:34,462 --> 00:30:35,964
Wait your turn!

349
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:40,844
Is this the tyranny of the majority?

350
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:43,721
You can't grasp the meaning of democracy.

351
00:30:52,282 --> 00:30:53,742
Want to demolish something?

352
00:30:53,762 --> 00:30:55,222
Demolish your own heads.

353
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,901
I have the floor!

354
00:30:57,026 --> 00:31:01,114
Destroy the old and you destroy our memory of the past.

355
00:31:01,364 --> 00:31:05,410
Don't you care about the people who lived and died before us?

356
00:31:05,618 --> 00:31:07,412
There's no future for people...

357
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:11,040
who worship the future and forget the past.

358
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:15,253
Democracy doesn't mean you can ignore the minority.

359
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,672
Throw the anarchists out!

360
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:20,591
Scrum!

361
00:31:20,592 --> 00:31:22,093
Eject them!

362
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:25,471
Stand fast, men!

363
00:31:25,648 --> 00:31:26,775
Get off the stage.

364
00:31:26,795 --> 00:31:27,922
You're history!

365
00:31:49,078 --> 00:32:47,011
A white flower was blooming That day long ago, in my homeland far away When at last we parted You looked away And didn't say a word I remember your long braids And the sadness in my heart As that white flower bloomed And the sadness in my heart As that white flower bloomed So what did you think?

366
00:32:47,146 --> 00:32:48,816
It was amazing.

367
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:50,506
Everybody's so passionate.

368
00:32:50,807 --> 00:32:52,475
Debates are always like that.

369
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:55,353
Most everyone thinks the clubhouse should go.

370
00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:57,522
Mizunuma's fighting a losing battle.

371
00:32:58,022 --> 00:32:59,440
You think?

372
00:33:12,787 --> 00:33:15,415
Maybe you could clean the place up.

373
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,544
It's old, but it's such a nice building.

374
00:33:19,846 --> 00:33:22,224
Make it like new again.

375
00:33:22,244 --> 00:33:24,622
Invite the girls to come see it.

376
00:33:25,184 --> 00:33:26,645
- Then they'll get it.

377
00:33:26,665 --> 00:33:28,126
- Maybe you're right.

378
00:33:28,678 --> 00:33:32,223
But the guys think all that dust is part of history.

379
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:35,351
The physics midterm forecast was a big hit.

380
00:33:35,768 --> 00:33:38,396
Everybody's waiting for the math forecast.

381
00:33:38,771 --> 00:33:40,023
Me too.

382
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:49,064
Thanks.

383
00:33:49,084 --> 00:33:50,149
You've been a big help.

384
00:33:51,502 --> 00:33:52,483
- See you soon.

385
00:33:52,503 --> 00:33:53,484
- So long.

386
00:33:58,301 --> 00:33:58,927
Umi!

387
00:33:58,947 --> 00:33:59,573
Thanks.

388
00:34:09,886 --> 00:34:11,846
Oh no... the fish!

389
00:34:15,276 --> 00:34:17,926
...then everyone started singing.

390
00:34:17,946 --> 00:34:20,596
The teachers were totally fooled.

391
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:29,781
It sounds like nothing's changed since I graduated.

392
00:34:29,947 --> 00:34:33,785
Your president Mizunuma is my classmate's little brother.

393
00:34:34,504 --> 00:34:36,138
- Was his brother a genius too?

394
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,792
- Sister.

395
00:34:37,812 --> 00:34:39,446
She's an astrophysicist.

396
00:34:39,749 --> 00:34:40,665
Wow...

397
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:43,294
What's all the excitement in here?

398
00:34:43,471 --> 00:34:44,702
- Great idea.

399
00:34:44,722 --> 00:34:45,953
- This is the best.

400
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:47,632
I'll slice some cheese.

401
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:48,894
- Can I taste it?

402
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:49,999
- Sorry, too young.

403
00:34:50,384 --> 00:34:53,471
Umi, why don't we invite some Konan graduates...

404
00:34:53,638 --> 00:34:55,181
to my farewell party?

405
00:34:56,015 --> 00:34:57,215
Who?

406
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,977
You know... the guys.

407
00:35:01,938 --> 00:35:03,314
Guys?

408
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:25,920
Hey.

409
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:32,093
H-O-K-U-T...

410
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:33,626
Hokuto.

411
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:36,472
You read signal flags?

412
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:43,604
The gate's open.

413
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,930
Coming.

414
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:02,623
Why not get married and start a practice right here?

415
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:04,542
We'd have to move out!

416
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:06,711
You'll be married by then.

417
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:08,629
I'd better start looking.

418
00:36:08,754 --> 00:36:11,257
Bet you find a real nice guy.

419
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:12,717
You're the best.

420
00:36:13,144 --> 00:36:15,084
- The trustees are the problem.

421
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:17,044
- The principal's a good guy.

422
00:36:17,231 --> 00:36:18,963
- He goes where the wind blows.

423
00:36:18,983 --> 00:36:20,715
- The chairman's an old fox.

424
00:36:21,058 --> 00:36:24,812
When's the principal going to quit?

425
00:36:25,062 --> 00:36:28,733
I think we can handle them, but we need a strategy.

426
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,905
Even with a strategy, what can we actually do?

427
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:36,490
We need more glasses.

428
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:38,191
I'll wash some.

429
00:36:38,211 --> 00:36:39,651
Here, take this out.

430
00:36:43,998 --> 00:36:46,000
The sushi's here.

431
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:47,951
Finally!

432
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:50,661
This building is 60 years old.

433
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:52,913
It used to be a hospital.

434
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:04,936
My great-grandfather loved cats.

435
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:10,441
Compared to the clubhouse, it looks like it was built yesterday.

436
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,736
You really take good care of it.

437
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:18,741
So I guess your dad must've been a doctor too?

438
00:37:18,908 --> 00:37:21,577
No, he was a ship captain.

439
00:37:24,455 --> 00:37:39,762
From this Valley They say you are going We will miss your bright eyes And sweet smile For they say You are faking the sunshine So your mom married a sailor.

440
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:43,057
Grandma and Grandpa were totally against it.

441
00:37:43,224 --> 00:37:44,809
They tried to stop her.

442
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:48,980
So Mom ran away and they eloped.

443
00:37:49,115 --> 00:37:51,035
I bet that took guts.

444
00:37:51,055 --> 00:37:52,975
I heard your mom's a professor.

445
00:37:55,454 --> 00:37:56,873
And the signal flags...

446
00:37:56,893 --> 00:37:58,312
Your dad taught you?

447
00:38:03,953 --> 00:38:06,789
Yes, when I was little.

448
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:15,965
He said they helped him find his way back to us.

449
00:38:16,173 --> 00:38:18,301
So I raised them every day.

450
00:38:20,094 --> 00:38:24,974
I'd raise them from the balcony until his ship docked again.

451
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:28,227
I never missed a day.

452
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,191
Then his ship sank in the Korean War.

453
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:36,027
And that was that.

454
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:39,488
But I never stopped raising those flags.

455
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,831
After I moved here, I wouldn't stop crying.

456
00:38:49,123 --> 00:38:51,500
There was nowhere to raise Dad's flags.

457
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:54,003
So Grandpa built me that flagpole.

458
00:39:09,268 --> 00:39:10,519
I'll open the curtains.

459
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:16,484
This used to be Grandpa's office.

460
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:18,903
Now it's my mom's study.

461
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:21,030
It looks like a library.

462
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:24,367
This is your family?

463
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:26,067
Yes.

464
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:28,111
Your father?

465
00:39:30,383 --> 00:39:31,948
That's Grandpa.

466
00:39:31,968 --> 00:39:33,533
My dad's right there.

467
00:39:37,765 --> 00:39:39,392
Isn't he handsome?

468
00:39:39,412 --> 00:39:41,039
That's when they got married.

469
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:44,720
This is the picture I really like.

470
00:39:55,398 --> 00:39:57,233
Yuichiro Sawamura...?

471
00:39:57,618 --> 00:39:59,267
That's my dad.

472
00:39:59,287 --> 00:40:00,936
Matsuzaki is my mom's name.

473
00:40:01,737 --> 00:40:03,989
Come on, it's speech time.

474
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,909
We better go down.

475
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:58,127
I'm back.

476
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:07,669
You're late.

477
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:11,140
You'll worry your mother.

478
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:22,892
- Shun, what about dinner?

479
00:41:22,912 --> 00:41:24,811
- I already ate.

480
00:41:30,169 --> 00:41:32,526
He swings...

481
00:41:32,546 --> 00:41:34,903
Nagashima strikes out!

482
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:55,518
ONODERA SAWAMURA TACHIBANA Yuichiro Sawamura...

483
00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:18,374
Thanks for coming.

484
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:20,533
What's going on?

485
00:42:27,226 --> 00:42:28,978
Welcome, volunteers.

486
00:42:28,998 --> 00:42:30,750
The Latin Quarter is all yours.

487
00:42:31,554 --> 00:42:35,057
You have our deepest thanks...

488
00:42:35,307 --> 00:42:38,894
for helping us to preserve this magnificent cultural landmark.

489
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,018
Remember, men.

490
00:42:47,038 --> 00:42:48,937
The heavy lifting is up to you.

491
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,940
Let's do it!

492
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:11,218
My shrine to Reason!

493
00:43:11,437 --> 00:43:12,939
- No exceptions, that's the rule.

494
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:14,461
- Okay, ready.

495
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:15,931
Here we go.

496
00:43:29,612 --> 00:43:31,614
Be careful, will you?

497
00:43:37,953 --> 00:43:39,455
Hey, watch it!

498
00:43:59,485 --> 00:44:01,259
1st Year Math... 2nd Year Math...

499
00:44:01,279 --> 00:44:03,053
These are old exams.

500
00:44:03,979 --> 00:44:05,856
We use those for forecasts.

501
00:44:06,325 --> 00:44:07,695
Here's Dr.

502
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:09,085
Hokuto's math final.

503
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,475
She got a perfect score.

504
00:44:20,297 --> 00:44:21,883
Take over for me.

505
00:44:21,903 --> 00:44:23,489
We need everything moved.

506
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:25,668
I'll give you a hand.

507
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:30,005
Heads up, Matsuzaki.

508
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:36,011
Mizunuma said to pitch anything we're not sure we need.

509
00:44:43,352 --> 00:44:44,645
It's so filthy.

510
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:46,772
Didn't you guys ever clean?

511
00:44:47,022 --> 00:44:49,400
Not since I've been here.

512
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:53,028
We better bring the badminton girls tomorrow.

513
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:55,531
Please do.

514
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:28,605
Sora, I'm going now.

515
00:45:28,897 --> 00:45:30,097
Okay.

516
00:45:30,232 --> 00:45:32,735
I'll be home by dinner.

517
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:53,130
Did something happen?

518
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:56,592
Not a thing.

519
00:45:58,427 --> 00:45:59,928
See you tomorrow.

520
00:46:55,234 --> 00:46:57,820
Dad, can I ask you something?

521
00:46:59,331 --> 00:47:00,479
I'm working.

522
00:47:00,499 --> 00:47:01,647
Make it short.

523
00:47:03,252 --> 00:47:05,463
Yuichiro Sawamura.

524
00:47:05,483 --> 00:47:07,694
He's my real father, right?

525
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:14,336
We've been over that.

526
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:18,882
You're my son.

527
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,883
It was blowing hard the night Sawamura brought you.

528
00:48:02,551 --> 00:48:07,222
He had his Family Register with him.

529
00:48:19,693 --> 00:48:22,571
We'd just lost a child of our own.

530
00:48:24,156 --> 00:48:27,409
Next thing I knew, your mother was nursing you.

531
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:29,411
She wouldn't let you go.

532
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:36,752
Sawamura was a good sailor.

533
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,506
His supply ship sank during a battle in the Korean War.

534
00:48:42,132 --> 00:48:44,593
Until the end, he helped us out.

535
00:48:46,887 --> 00:48:49,890
You remind me of him more every day.

536
00:48:50,557 --> 00:48:52,517
But you're still our son.

537
00:48:54,603 --> 00:48:56,939
Thanks, Dad.

538
00:49:21,755 --> 00:49:23,298
Is it out there?

539
00:49:23,507 --> 00:49:24,800
Not yet.

540
00:49:36,144 --> 00:49:38,313
Guess it's not coming by today.

541
00:50:14,016 --> 00:50:18,395
THE LATIN QUARTER REBORN!

542
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:30,699
May I...?

543
00:50:30,866 --> 00:50:32,743
Come in, Umi.

544
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,708
You're really leaving.

545
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:41,710
Thanks for all your help.

546
00:50:42,095 --> 00:50:44,139
- I wish I could see you off.

547
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:46,203
- Go on, I'll be fine.

548
00:50:47,382 --> 00:50:48,582
We'll miss you.

549
00:50:49,603 --> 00:50:51,439
I'll drop by now and then.

550
00:50:51,459 --> 00:50:53,295
You'd better get to school.

551
00:50:57,726 --> 00:50:59,603
Good luck with Shun.

552
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:06,777
Take care.

553
00:51:22,584 --> 00:51:25,754
Extra, extra!

554
00:51:26,922 --> 00:51:30,717
Extra edition of The Latin Quarter Weekly.

555
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:32,803
We'll need your help today.

556
00:51:32,938 --> 00:51:34,440
Latin Quarter gets a facelift!

557
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,962
Extra, extra!

558
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:39,810
I'll be there again today.

559
00:51:40,153 --> 00:51:41,280
Hi.

560
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,427
You're working hard.

561
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:45,232
Hey, see you there, okay?

562
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,442
Here, Matsuzaki.

563
00:51:50,956 --> 00:51:52,855
Extra, extra!

564
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:54,774
Get your Latin Quarter.

565
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:57,744
Extra!

566
00:52:06,128 --> 00:52:07,504
Next label, please.

567
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:16,138
He's so brave.

568
00:52:25,157 --> 00:52:26,221
- This is great.

569
00:52:26,241 --> 00:52:27,305
- Let's go look.

570
00:53:08,481 --> 00:53:10,901
If you don't like me, just say so.

571
00:53:22,422 --> 00:53:23,987
Yuichiro Sawamura.

572
00:53:24,007 --> 00:53:25,572
He's my real father.

573
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:29,878
It's like some cheap melodrama.

574
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:34,382
I don't understand.

575
00:53:34,768 --> 00:53:36,500
Dad told me years ago.

576
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,252
I even checked at City Hall.

577
00:53:38,595 --> 00:53:39,795
But then...

578
00:53:41,097 --> 00:53:43,266
We're brother and sister.

579
00:53:47,437 --> 00:53:49,189
What should we do?

580
00:53:49,606 --> 00:53:53,276
We forget whatever it was we felt about each other.

581
00:53:57,113 --> 00:53:59,783
We'll just be friends, like before.

582
00:54:24,516 --> 00:54:27,686
Sora, did something happen to Umi at school?

583
00:54:28,436 --> 00:54:31,690
No, at least I don't think so.

584
00:54:32,107 --> 00:54:33,692
Are you sure?

585
00:54:33,942 --> 00:54:36,778
That dinner tonight was pretty strange.

586
00:54:36,903 --> 00:54:38,822
And she was soaked.

587
00:54:39,499 --> 00:54:42,065
Something must've happened.

588
00:54:42,085 --> 00:54:44,651
She's never come home that late.

589
00:54:53,003 --> 00:54:55,171
Umi, the bath's ready.

590
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:57,674
Not tonight.

591
00:54:59,175 --> 00:55:00,677
Don't you feel well?

592
00:55:47,557 --> 00:55:49,392
Umi...

593
00:55:50,393 --> 00:55:51,593
Umi...

594
00:55:53,396 --> 00:55:54,596
Umi...

595
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:44,729
Good morning, Umi.

596
00:56:44,749 --> 00:56:46,147
Did you sleep well?

597
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,295
Mom?

598
00:56:48,315 --> 00:56:49,650
When did you come back?

599
00:56:50,463 --> 00:56:52,112
Don't be silly.

600
00:56:52,132 --> 00:56:53,781
I've been here all along.

601
00:56:55,635 --> 00:56:57,534
Umi, I'm hoisting the flags.

602
00:56:57,554 --> 00:56:59,453
Come give me a hand.

603
00:57:14,477 --> 00:57:15,812
Dad...?

604
00:57:18,148 --> 00:57:20,692
I'll be home for a long time.

605
00:57:33,496 --> 00:57:35,999
You're such a big girl now.

606
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,232
Need more supplies?

607
00:59:13,252 --> 00:59:14,504
Just ask this guy.

608
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:16,140
He's in construction.

609
00:59:16,276 --> 00:59:17,688
- Come on, no more freebies.

610
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:19,120
- Why not?

611
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,552
Business is good.

612
00:59:20,853 --> 00:59:22,480
HOPE YOU guys win.

613
00:59:22,605 --> 00:59:24,232
Thank you.

614
00:59:25,108 --> 00:59:26,149
Unbelievable.

615
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,280
We owe this to Dr.

616
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:28,420
Hokuto.

617
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,560
No, even more to Umi.

618
00:59:30,363 --> 00:59:32,740
She's our goddess of good luck.

619
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:38,913
Hi guys- This is practically a construction site.

620
00:59:46,629 --> 00:59:48,131
What are you doing?

621
00:59:49,382 --> 00:59:51,801
Give me that for a sec.

622
00:59:52,051 --> 00:59:55,597
Let me show you how the pros do it.

623
01:00:05,315 --> 01:00:06,608
Incredible!

624
01:00:06,733 --> 01:00:09,444
My dad's a plasterer.

625
01:00:09,736 --> 01:00:11,446
Beautiful...

626
01:00:11,863 --> 01:00:13,114
What's that?

627
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:14,490
The wall, I mean.

628
01:00:14,741 --> 01:00:16,117
WHAT?

629
01:00:22,332 --> 01:00:23,532
Hey.

630
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:25,793
That's it for today.

631
01:00:27,555 --> 01:00:29,245
Thanks for staying late.

632
01:00:29,265 --> 01:00:30,955
You don't have to go back?

633
01:00:31,351 --> 01:00:33,395
Sora's covering for me.

634
01:00:33,415 --> 01:00:35,459
Can I help out with anything?

635
01:00:40,016 --> 01:00:41,809
Could you do this?

636
01:00:46,356 --> 01:00:48,024
Can I have two days?

637
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:51,194
That'll really help, thanks.

638
01:00:51,371 --> 01:00:52,498
- See you.

639
01:00:52,518 --> 01:00:53,645
- So long.

640
01:01:21,557 --> 01:01:27,457
VISIT THE NEW LATIN QUARTER!

641
01:01:33,736 --> 01:01:39,575
MAJORITY OF GIRLS OPPOSE DEMOLITION!

642
01:01:46,082 --> 01:01:51,587
MIDTERM RESULTS ANNOUNCED, TEST FORECAST VINDICATED!

643
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:03,433
MAJORITY OF ALL STUDENTS OPPOSE DEMOLITION!

644
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:16,779
Ready, everybody?

645
01:02:44,432 --> 01:02:46,309
Umi, don't go.

646
01:02:46,976 --> 01:02:48,936
Shun, it's bad news.

647
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:52,190
The board just voted to tear us down.

648
01:02:55,902 --> 01:02:58,154
The principal won't listen to reason.

649
01:02:58,321 --> 01:02:59,822
All our hard work!

650
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:02,022
- They won't even come?

651
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:04,065
- Then they'd have to back down.

652
01:03:04,327 --> 01:03:05,527
Right!

653
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:08,289
Mob the principal's office!

654
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:10,875
Let's go straight to the chairman.

655
01:03:11,677 --> 01:03:13,659
Of the Tokumaru Foundation?

656
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:15,661
He's pretty hard to see.

657
01:03:15,848 --> 01:03:17,497
You guys go see him.

658
01:03:17,517 --> 01:03:19,166
Tell him how it is.

659
01:03:19,342 --> 01:03:21,344
Yes, please go.

660
01:03:22,553 --> 01:03:24,847
Mizunuma, we've got to go to Tokyo.

661
01:03:27,767 --> 01:03:28,967
Please!

662
01:03:31,697 --> 01:03:33,429
It's worth a shot.

663
01:03:33,449 --> 01:03:35,181
Umi, we need you too.

664
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:38,569
Tell him, Umi!

665
01:03:48,162 --> 01:03:51,207
Umi, good luck tomorrow.

666
01:04:08,516 --> 01:04:09,892
Good morning.

667
01:04:11,227 --> 01:04:12,562
Did you skip class?

668
01:04:12,895 --> 01:04:15,857
No, I told them yesterday I'd be absent.

669
01:04:16,399 --> 01:04:19,235
Then we'd better get going.

670
01:04:33,749 --> 01:05:06,782
FOR A SUCCESSFUL OLYMPICS, MAKE TOKYO BEAUTIFUL Let's give it our best shot.

671
01:05:08,367 --> 01:05:11,829
Yes, that's what they say.

672
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:14,123
No appointment?

673
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,552
We're appealing directly to Mr.

674
01:05:15,572 --> 01:05:16,824
Tokumaru.

675
01:05:17,293 --> 01:05:19,629
Something about a direct appeal.

676
01:05:19,962 --> 01:05:22,798
Yes, students from Konan Academy.

677
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:24,967
Three of them.

678
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:27,470
All right.

679
01:05:29,055 --> 01:05:33,142
Take the elevator to the fourth floor and wait there.

680
01:05:33,976 --> 01:05:35,176
Fourth floor.

681
01:05:35,488 --> 01:05:36,907
Don't forget to sign in.

682
01:05:36,927 --> 01:05:38,346
One name is fine.

683
01:05:48,491 --> 01:05:50,284
Are you the Konan students?

684
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:51,860
Yes.

685
01:05:52,995 --> 01:05:54,997
The president's very busy.

686
01:05:55,206 --> 01:05:58,668
I can't guarantee he'll have time for you.

687
01:05:59,085 --> 01:06:00,419
We're sorry to disturb him.

688
01:06:00,544 --> 01:06:04,674
We didn't think he'd agree to an appointment.

689
01:06:06,217 --> 01:06:10,096
You may just be wasting your time...

690
01:06:10,262 --> 01:06:12,682
but please wait here if you like.

691
01:06:13,724 --> 01:06:15,351
We'll Wait!

692
01:06:16,185 --> 01:06:18,980
Oh come on, Kimura has the best pastries.

693
01:06:19,105 --> 01:06:20,690
Nakamura's hard to beat.

694
01:06:20,866 --> 01:06:22,765
I can't believe you'd say that.

695
01:06:22,785 --> 01:06:24,684
You don't know your pastries.

696
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:31,399
Thank you.

697
01:06:59,395 --> 01:07:02,440
It's as plain as the nose on your face.

698
01:07:14,577 --> 01:07:17,246
Come on in, kids.

699
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:23,586
Excuse us.

700
01:07:29,133 --> 01:07:30,760
Have a seat.

701
01:07:30,926 --> 01:07:32,928
Be with you in a minute.

702
01:07:33,564 --> 01:07:35,733
So you see how it is.

703
01:07:35,753 --> 01:07:37,922
Yes, give him my regards.

704
01:07:45,775 --> 01:07:47,276
Sit.

705
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:50,279
Now, why aren't you kids in school?

706
01:07:50,446 --> 01:07:52,281
We escaped.

707
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:54,190
Escaped?

708
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:55,942
I did that a lot myself.

709
01:07:56,786 --> 01:07:59,622
You're here about your clubhouse, I suppose.

710
01:07:59,789 --> 01:08:04,627
Yes, we'd like to ask you to come and inspect it yourself.

711
01:08:04,794 --> 01:08:06,629
You're welcome any time.

712
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:10,257
What year are you?

713
01:08:10,893 --> 01:08:12,312
I'm a junior.

714
01:08:12,332 --> 01:08:13,751
Umi Matsuzaki.

715
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:16,263
I help out with the school paper.

716
01:08:17,807 --> 01:08:20,351
What do you care about that old shack?

717
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,812
We all love it.

718
01:08:23,197 --> 01:08:25,409
We spent hours making it look new.

719
01:08:25,429 --> 01:08:27,641
Please see for yourself.

720
01:08:29,944 --> 01:08:31,821
You cleaned it up?

721
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:34,990
What does your father do?

722
01:08:36,117 --> 01:08:39,245
He was a ship captain in the Korean War.

723
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:41,831
His ship hit a mine.

724
01:09:14,905 --> 01:09:16,532
A supply ship?

725
01:09:16,824 --> 01:09:18,024
Yes.

726
01:09:19,243 --> 01:09:20,536
I see.

727
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:25,541
It must've been hard for your mother, raising you alone.

728
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:28,043
She did a fine job.

729
01:09:29,378 --> 01:09:30,578
Thank you.

730
01:09:31,755 --> 01:09:34,049
All right, I'll go.

731
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:39,221
Thank you!

732
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:43,058
It's me.

733
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:44,592
What's on tomorrow?

734
01:09:45,686 --> 01:09:47,730
Let's see, that's in the evening.

735
01:09:48,898 --> 01:09:50,566
Move the rest to Friday.

736
01:09:52,411 --> 01:09:53,559
It's settled.

737
01:09:53,579 --> 01:09:54,727
Tomorrow afternoon.

738
01:09:54,904 --> 01:09:58,949
I'll contact your principal and do an official inspection tour.

739
01:10:04,006 --> 01:10:05,780
- Some grownups are pretty cool.

740
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,574
- Don't count your chickens.

741
01:10:09,335 --> 01:10:10,753
I'm glad we came.

742
01:10:13,098 --> 01:10:14,997
I have to swing by my uncle's place.

743
01:10:15,017 --> 01:10:16,916
See you tomorrow.

744
01:10:53,796 --> 01:10:56,632
What are you doing after graduation?

745
01:10:56,809 --> 01:10:58,624
I can't afford much tuition.

746
01:10:58,644 --> 01:11:00,459
I'll apply to a national university.

747
01:11:01,136 --> 01:11:02,805
What about the Weekly?

748
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:06,475
I'll find somebody to take over after things are settled.

749
01:11:06,809 --> 01:11:08,102
What about you?

750
01:11:10,062 --> 01:11:11,647
I haven't decided.

751
01:11:12,189 --> 01:11:14,984
I'd like to be a doctor, though.

752
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:26,620
Are you the one who wrote that poem?

753
01:11:28,289 --> 01:11:32,001
I saw you raising your flags every morning from my dad's tug.

754
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:36,672
I can't see the tug passing by from the garden.

755
01:11:37,339 --> 01:11:41,510
That's why I never noticed you were answering me.

756
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:54,982
Shun?

757
01:11:57,609 --> 01:12:00,195
Listen, I...

758
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:06,076
Those flags were a message to my dad.

759
01:12:06,211 --> 01:12:08,381
I think he sent you to me.

760
01:12:08,401 --> 01:12:10,571
That's what I want to believe.

761
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:17,588
I'm in love with you, Shun.

762
01:12:18,047 --> 01:12:19,247
Umi...

763
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:22,217
Even if we're related, even if you're my brother...

764
01:12:22,384 --> 01:12:24,219
my feelings will never change.

765
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:35,689
I feel the same about you.

766
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:57,586
I'm back.

767
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,000
Let's try it.

768
01:13:04,093 --> 01:13:05,293
Mom!

769
01:13:06,053 --> 01:13:07,638
Umi, I'm home.

770
01:13:08,148 --> 01:13:09,609
Finally!

771
01:13:09,629 --> 01:13:11,090
How was America?

772
01:13:11,225 --> 01:13:14,103
I was busy learning every day.

773
01:13:14,728 --> 01:13:16,772
Any boyfriends yet, Sora?

774
01:13:16,897 --> 01:13:18,232
Not yet.

775
01:13:18,357 --> 01:13:20,776
This is great stuff, Mom.

776
01:13:21,068 --> 01:13:22,486
It's called jerky.

777
01:13:22,903 --> 01:13:23,945
Is it pork?

778
01:13:23,946 --> 01:13:26,949
Hiro, it says beef on the package.

779
01:13:38,293 --> 01:13:39,628
Mom?

780
01:13:42,881 --> 01:13:44,925
You're up pretty late.

781
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:51,432
I wanted to ask you something.

782
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,308
Ask away, then.

783
01:13:58,772 --> 01:14:00,482
I'm wide awake.

784
01:14:00,858 --> 01:14:03,986
Sorting through these books woke me up even more.

785
01:14:04,413 --> 01:14:06,165
There's this boy at school.

786
01:14:06,185 --> 01:14:07,937
His name is Shun Kazama.

787
01:14:11,201 --> 01:14:13,328
He came for the farewell party.

788
01:14:13,505 --> 01:14:15,404
I showed him Dad's picture.

789
01:14:15,424 --> 01:14:17,323
He had the same photo.

790
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:20,836
He says his real father is Yuichiro Sawamura.

791
01:14:40,147 --> 01:14:41,356
This one?

792
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:51,533
I'm afraid this is all a little bit complicated.

793
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:56,497
I told you about how your father and I eloped.

794
01:14:57,664 --> 01:14:59,583
You remember, don't you?

795
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:04,046
Our first place was that second-floor apartment.

796
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,591
Yuichiro was away a lot.

797
01:15:07,758 --> 01:15:12,888
I was pregnant with you and working on my degree.

798
01:15:13,732 --> 01:15:15,881
I loved school so much.

799
01:15:15,901 --> 01:15:18,050
I was determined to do well.

800
01:15:34,535 --> 01:15:35,735
Yuichi...

801
01:15:36,703 --> 01:15:39,081
Yuichiro, whose baby is that?

802
01:15:39,925 --> 01:15:41,240
It's Tachibana's boy.

803
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:42,575
He's ours now.

804
01:15:44,586 --> 01:15:49,091
Tachibana was killed in an accident on a repatriation ship.

805
01:15:49,476 --> 01:15:51,166
His wife died giving birth.

806
01:15:51,186 --> 01:15:52,876
The Bomb killed their relatives.

807
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:58,100
If we don't register him as ours, he'll end up in an orphanage.

808
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:06,108
Yuichiro registered the baby as his son and brought him home.

809
01:16:06,451 --> 01:16:08,517
The war had just ended.

810
01:16:08,537 --> 01:16:10,603
It was happening everywhere.

811
01:16:11,915 --> 01:16:14,397
But I was already pregnant.

812
01:16:14,417 --> 01:16:16,899
There was no way I could raise him.

813
01:16:17,286 --> 01:16:21,915
Yuichiro's friend lost a child, so we gave the baby up.

814
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:25,919
Is he doing well?

815
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:30,632
I'm so glad.

816
01:16:31,435 --> 01:16:33,688
Your father was so good-hearted.

817
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:35,961
Maybe just a little impulsive.

818
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:40,142
Without his help, I couldn't have finished school.

819
01:16:41,226 --> 01:16:46,815
But what if Shun was really Dad's son?

820
01:16:47,941 --> 01:16:50,152
If he was really Yuichiro's son?

821
01:16:50,777 --> 01:16:52,321
I'd like to meet him.

822
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:54,823
Does he look like this picture?

823
01:17:06,043 --> 01:17:07,336
Umi...

824
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:43,246
See you tonight.

825
01:17:43,955 --> 01:17:45,540
Have a nice day.

826
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:50,772
Welcome to the Latin Quarter.

827
01:19:05,912 --> 01:19:20,343
LATIN QUARTER WELCOMES CHAIRMAN TOKUMARU I never realized this building was so impressive.

828
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,137
Thank you, sir.

829
01:19:23,805 --> 01:19:26,141
What are you studying?

830
01:19:26,276 --> 01:19:28,175
Sir!

831
01:19:28,195 --> 01:19:30,094
The Astronomy Club has studied sunspots for 10 years.

832
01:19:30,405 --> 01:19:32,345
10 years?

833
01:19:32,365 --> 01:19:34,305
And what did you discover?

834
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:38,820
The sun is very old, and our lifespan is short.

835
01:19:38,945 --> 01:19:40,280
No discoveries so far!

836
01:19:40,739 --> 01:19:42,783
Excellent answer.

837
01:19:49,498 --> 01:19:51,666
The Philosophy Club?

838
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:55,086
Wouldn't you like a brand new clubhouse?

839
01:19:56,379 --> 01:19:58,840
What about your junior members?

840
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:03,345
Sir, we philosophers can be content with just a barrel.

841
01:20:03,647 --> 01:20:04,566
Diogenes!

842
01:20:04,586 --> 01:20:05,505
Very good.

843
01:20:09,768 --> 01:20:13,355
Principal, your students are really quite impressive.

844
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:17,526
Shun Kazama?

845
01:20:24,825 --> 01:20:26,201
Hello, Dad?

846
01:20:26,409 --> 01:20:28,870
The third man in the photo is here.

847
01:20:29,162 --> 01:20:31,206
He can tell you about your father.

848
01:20:32,624 --> 01:20:35,836
His ship leaves at four o'clock.

849
01:20:36,137 --> 01:20:37,744
He won't be back for months.

850
01:20:37,764 --> 01:20:39,371
Get down here!

851
01:20:50,225 --> 01:21:52,954
Should the world sink Beneath the indigo waves Stand fast, sink not Beneath that horizon Stand fast against the flood Like a great range of mountains With pinnacles thrust high Into the Winds of the future Should the World sink Beneath the indigo waves Stand fast, sink not Beneath that horizon My friends, you have shown me the Latin Quarter's true value.

852
01:21:53,079 --> 01:21:57,125
How can we educate the young without protecting our culture?

853
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:03,632
I'll just find a different site for the new building.

854
01:22:05,467 --> 01:22:08,136
All right!

855
01:22:08,678 --> 01:22:10,805
Umi, you did it.

856
01:22:11,097 --> 01:22:12,641
We all did it.

857
01:22:12,901 --> 01:22:14,174
Awesome!

858
01:22:14,194 --> 01:22:15,467
Magnificent!

859
01:22:21,816 --> 01:22:24,319
On to the next experiment.

860
01:22:25,528 --> 01:22:27,822
Umi, we owe this to you.

861
01:22:28,823 --> 01:22:31,326
But I didn't do anything special.

862
01:22:31,618 --> 01:22:34,079
Fixing things up was your idea.

863
01:22:34,245 --> 01:22:35,329
She's right.

864
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:37,499
Thank you, Umi.

865
01:22:39,636 --> 01:22:40,492
Good for you.

866
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,368
Umi.

867
01:22:42,754 --> 01:22:43,954
Umi!

868
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:50,845
The perfect couple.

869
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:55,100
Please excuse them, sir.

870
01:22:55,225 --> 01:22:58,353
Something very important is happening to both of them.

871
01:22:58,645 --> 01:23:00,397
They have to hurry.

872
01:23:01,032 --> 01:23:02,847
Escape.

873
01:23:02,867 --> 01:23:04,682
It's great to be young.

874
01:23:09,155 --> 01:23:10,365
Shun!

875
01:23:10,907 --> 01:23:12,867
Give us a ride.

876
01:23:13,618 --> 01:23:15,036
Umi?

877
01:23:24,087 --> 01:23:27,716
Don't worry Umi, I'll get you there in time.

878
01:23:39,102 --> 01:23:40,562
We'd better run.

879
01:23:40,687 --> 01:23:42,063
Thanks!

880
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:45,400
Good luck, Umi.

881
01:23:52,834 --> 01:23:54,191
Come on, Shun.

882
01:23:54,211 --> 01:23:55,568
Hurry!

883
01:23:56,786 --> 01:23:57,986
Thanks.

884
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,152
That's my dad's tug.

885
01:24:56,179 --> 01:24:58,306
Here they are, captain.

886
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:09,943
Push our departure back 15 minutes.

887
01:25:14,489 --> 01:25:17,992
So you're Tachibana's boy.

888
01:25:19,452 --> 01:25:21,996
And you must be Sawamura's daughter.

889
01:25:22,288 --> 01:25:23,665
Both fine-looking youngsters.

890
01:25:39,472 --> 01:25:41,182
It's Shun, right?

891
01:25:41,933 --> 01:25:44,686
Your father was Hiroshi Tachibana.

892
01:25:44,978 --> 01:25:47,856
Front row, fourth from the right.

893
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:50,859
You can see Sawamura next to him.

894
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:54,028
We three were close friends.

895
01:25:55,238 --> 01:25:57,866
Take the seat of honor, Tachibana.

896
01:25:57,991 --> 01:25:58,991
Why me?

897
01:25:59,002 --> 01:26:00,087
You're our leader.

898
01:26:00,107 --> 01:26:01,192
You belong there.

899
01:26:01,452 --> 01:26:03,872
All right, let's do it.

900
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:09,210
Just don't die before me, okay?

901
01:26:10,086 --> 01:26:11,713
Same goes for you.

902
01:26:12,172 --> 01:26:13,590
Here we go.

903
01:26:26,019 --> 01:26:30,565
I was away at sea when your parents passed on.

904
01:26:30,857 --> 01:26:34,235
Otherwise I'd have done exactly what Sawamura did.

905
01:26:35,528 --> 01:26:40,074
Meeting you two is like seeing my old friends again.

906
01:26:40,376 --> 01:26:41,941
Thank you both.

907
01:26:41,961 --> 01:26:43,526
I've never been so happy.

908
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:30,644
A cross the shining sea, A ship disappears in the sunlight Its horn trails a note of farewell If I walk down that gentle slope Will I feel a breeze the color of summer?

909
01:27:31,668 --> 01:28:12,750
My love is a melody I sing it high and low My love is a seagull That soars and swoops If I call out to you at twilight Will I see you there my sweet?

910
01:28:45,199 --> 01:29:11,912
Swaying branches along the path Leave farewell shadows on the ground A weather vane rooster, an old chapel Will I see a city Steeped in summer hues?

911
01:29:12,852 --> 01:29:52,953
Yesterday's love is my fears They dry and vanish with time Tomorrow's love is a refrain Words without end If we meet at twilight Will you hold me in your arms?

912
