19
00:09:06,622 --> 00:10:25,677
That's right Ghosts don't come out on days like this When you walk into a dark room from outside your eyes dim and so the dust bunnies come out Oh, I see Come here, dust bunnies Come out, come out wherever you are Let's get to work See if you can find how to get upstairs Get up there and open all the windows Sure I'm coming, too Toilet Not here Nothing here Nothing Nothing here Nothing Nothing Nothing Nothing Mei, it's here It's pitch black Dust bunnies Another acorn Come out, dust bunnies Are you there, Mr.

24
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,597
Are they like goblins or something?
