1
00:05:18,051 --> 00:07:24,718
PONYO ON THE CLIFF Sosuke, come right back up, OK?

2
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:25,803
OK!

3
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:07,488
It's a goldfish!

4
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,086
I can't get it out.

5
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:40,646
That was weird.

6
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,954
It looks kind of dead.

7
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:02,346
It licked me!

8
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:03,326
It's alive!

9
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:08,215
Sosuke, we have to go!

10
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,478
- Lisa, a goldfish!

11
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:11,916
- Sosuke!

12
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,231
This wind is crazy.

13
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,859
Sosuke, I'm starting the car now!

14
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:37,286
Have you found her?

15
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:44,367
What?

16
00:10:44,387 --> 00:10:45,952
She was captured by a human?

17
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:50,122
This is bad.

18
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:51,372
This is very bad.

19
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,411
Is it already dead?

20
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:28,587
It's alive!

21
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,890
Sosuke.

22
00:11:40,402 --> 00:11:43,196
- We're gonna be late!

23
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:46,010
- Lisa, the goldfish is alive!

24
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:47,826
- A goldfish?

25
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:49,556
- It was right down by the rocks.

26
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:50,692
Yeah?

27
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:19,179
I don't know who you are, but please don't spray pesticide around here!

28
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:22,986
Oh, no.

29
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:24,299
This is not pesticide.

30
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:27,646
I brought this water from deep sea to prevent extreme dry skin...

31
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,762
Whatever.

32
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:29,804
As long as it's not pesticide.

33
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:31,817
Excuse us.

34
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,275
This is bad.

35
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:42,400
This is very bad.

36
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:46,086
That guy was a freak show.

37
00:12:46,106 --> 00:12:47,268
Just kidding.

38
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:48,450
Never say such a thing, Sosuke.

39
00:12:48,553 --> 00:12:50,138
- We never judge others by their looks.

40
00:12:50,158 --> 00:12:51,743
- I don't say such things.

41
00:12:51,848 --> 00:12:53,329
- Are you taking that to pre-school?

42
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:54,830
- Yeah.

43
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:57,833
- Your teachers don't tell you not to?

44
00:12:57,853 --> 00:13:00,501
- Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

45
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,055
She's cute.

46
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:10,814
A ship must be coming in today.

47
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,610
Sosuke, eat your breakfast.

48
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:18,572
I wonder if she would eat this.

49
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:20,407
Want some?

50
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:23,025
Hey!

51
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:24,025
My cut is all gone!

52
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:29,875
Lisa, I think I'll call her Ponyo.

53
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:32,577
She came to me.

54
00:13:32,597 --> 00:13:34,162
Besides, she might be magic.

55
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:37,382
Ponyo licked my cut and it healed right away.

56
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:48,977
Do you wanna eat ham?

57
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,828
Lisa, Ponyo really likes to eat ham.

58
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,580
Just like me.

59
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:37,725
- Oh, dear...

60
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:38,934
Oh, dear...

61
00:14:38,954 --> 00:14:40,143
- Come on, Lisa, hurry!

62
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:50,029
Filthy.

63
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:51,113
It's so filthy!

64
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,960
Good morning!

65
00:15:01,644 --> 00:15:03,021
Ponyo, look.

66
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,418
You can see our house.

67
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:26,830
- We'll park here.

68
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,386
OK?

69
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:27,942
- Yeah.

70
00:15:28,046 --> 00:15:29,173
- Have a nice day.

71
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:30,320
- See you later.

72
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:32,780
Morning!

73
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,572
Sorry for being late!

74
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:34,823
- Get Noriko's wheelchair?

75
00:15:34,843 --> 00:15:35,990
- Sure.

76
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,768
Good morning, Sosuke.

77
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:54,259
I'm busy right now, Yoshie.

78
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,676
I'll talk to you later.

79
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:57,200
- Oh, my...

80
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,638
- Sosuke, dear.

81
00:15:58,743 --> 00:16:00,036
- Toki, I'll catch you later.

82
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:01,349
- My goodness...

83
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,702
I wonder if my teacher will say no.

84
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:13,455
I got it.

85
00:16:17,762 --> 00:16:19,097
You'll wait here.

86
00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:20,452
I'll be back soon.

87
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,217
I hope cats won't come around here.

88
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:37,532
Stay put.

89
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:39,429
I'll be right back.

90
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,168
See you later.

91
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:49,273
Hello there, Toshi.

92
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:52,610
She has a little fever, but she's active.

93
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,111
She should be OK.

94
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:55,098
- Right, sweetie?

95
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:56,001
- Oh, thank you.

96
00:16:56,021 --> 00:16:56,904
Bye-bye.

97
00:16:57,593 --> 00:16:59,033
- Good morning, Teacher.

98
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:00,493
- Good morning, Sosuke.

99
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,878
How are you, Sosuke?

100
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:08,458
- Sosuke!

101
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:09,583
- Kumiko!

102
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:10,711
Look!

103
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:11,753
Isn't this dress pretty?

104
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:12,795
My mom bought it for me.

105
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,890
Is that so?

106
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,897
- Hey, Sosuke, wanna go play?

107
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:17,204
- I can't.

108
00:17:17,224 --> 00:17:18,511
I'm busy right now.

109
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:20,241
- What are you doing here?

110
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:21,888
- Like I said, I'm busy.

111
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:23,536
- You're acting weird, Sosuke.

112
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:25,099
- Yeah, weird.

113
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,340
Ponyo!

114
00:17:55,183 --> 00:17:56,183
Sosuke!

115
00:17:56,944 --> 00:17:58,071
- Oh, Kumiko.

116
00:17:58,091 --> 00:17:59,218
- What is that?

117
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,897
You're not supposed to bring stuff to school.

118
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,774
These brushes are not school's.

119
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:06,401
They're on the senior center property, so it's OK.

120
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,903
Let me see!

121
00:18:08,863 --> 00:18:10,113
Oh, a goldfish!

122
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:11,668
She's not just a goldfish.

123
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:12,815
She's Ponyo.

124
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:14,108
Ponyo?

125
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:15,317
I wanna see!

126
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,496
If I show her, you won't tell anyone?

127
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,080
No, I won't.

128
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:21,865
Look.

129
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:22,740
Isn't she cute?

130
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:30,416
She's weird.

131
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:31,625
She's fat, too.

132
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:32,834
My goldfish is cuter.

133
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:57,484
That one was Kumiko's fault.

134
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,652
You should Never judge others by their looks.

135
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:05,377
Let's get you some more water.

136
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,109
Ponyo!

137
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:37,117
I'm relieved.

138
00:19:42,258 --> 00:19:44,886
That's strange...

139
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:47,534
I hear Sosuke's voice.

140
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:52,966
But he's supposed to be in school right now.

141
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,653
- So it must be only in my head.

142
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:56,266
- Look, Yoshie.

143
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:57,879
I'm right over here.

144
00:19:59,108 --> 00:20:00,735
Oh, my...

145
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:02,382
Sosuke is here.

146
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,271
Do I have something nice?

147
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:07,345
- Yes, you do.

148
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:08,345
- Bingo!

149
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:12,152
All right then, what color is it?

150
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,562
- Red!

151
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:16,604
- Red!

152
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:17,782
That's right!

153
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:20,880
- How did you both guess that?

154
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,694
- Come on, show us!

155
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:23,788
OK.

156
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:28,284
- Pretty!

157
00:20:28,304 --> 00:20:29,869
- Cute.

158
00:20:29,972 --> 00:20:31,161
Her name is Ponyo.

159
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:32,370
She likes to eat ham.

160
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,382
And she can do magic!

161
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:39,304
A cut on my thumb disappeared because Ponyo licked it.

162
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:45,226
Maybe she could lick our legs.

163
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:49,522
I wish I could run fast, once again, like you, Sosuke.

164
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:51,557
Well, I'd have to ask Ponyo.

165
00:20:51,577 --> 00:20:53,517
I can't speak for her.

166
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:55,373
- Let me take a look, too.

167
00:20:55,393 --> 00:20:57,145
- Sure, Toki.

168
00:20:59,877 --> 00:21:01,254
Oh, no!

169
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:02,651
It's a fish with a human face!

170
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:04,987
Hurry up!

171
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:06,238
Put it back in the ocean.

172
00:21:06,258 --> 00:21:07,489
Don't you realize it'll cause a tsunami?

173
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,669
Here you go again, Toki, worrying about a tsunami.

174
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:14,589
When fish with faces come out to the beach, tsunamis will come.

175
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,424
That's what they always say.

176
00:21:19,021 --> 00:21:20,586
Tsunami!

177
00:21:20,606 --> 00:21:22,171
Tsunami is here!

178
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:25,350
Tsunami is here!

179
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,185
Tsunami...

180
00:21:30,783 --> 00:21:32,765
- Toki, what's the matter?

181
00:21:32,785 --> 00:21:34,767
- My clothes are all ruined!

182
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:55,463
Sosuke!

183
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,353
Sosuke!

184
00:21:59,373 --> 00:22:01,667
Come back here and apologize to Toki!

185
00:22:11,157 --> 00:22:13,139
Don't worry, Ponyo.

186
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:15,141
No matter what, I will protect you.

187
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:23,199
Sosuke!

188
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:28,538
Ponyo!

189
00:22:31,302 --> 00:22:32,429
Ponyo.

190
00:22:32,449 --> 00:22:33,576
Sosuke.

191
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,756
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

192
00:22:43,856 --> 00:22:45,963
- I will love you, too.

193
00:22:45,983 --> 00:22:48,090
- Ponyo loves Sosuke!

194
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:30,308
Ponyo!

195
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:33,031
Ponyo!

196
00:23:33,051 --> 00:23:34,136
Ponyo!

197
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:36,481
Ponyo!

198
00:23:38,994 --> 00:23:40,329
Ponyo!

199
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:41,684
Ponyo!

200
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,572
Sosuke!

201
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:49,318
Ponyo!

202
00:23:49,338 --> 00:23:52,655
Ponyo!

203
00:23:53,874 --> 00:23:54,874
Ponyo!

204
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:52,599
Listen, Sosuke, there's such a thing as destiny.

205
00:24:52,683 --> 00:24:55,226
You can't change one's destiny no matter how tough it is.

206
00:24:55,978 --> 00:25:00,064
I think Ponyo went back to the ocean because she was meant to live there.

207
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,735
Anyway, hopefully that pesticide guy is gone.

208
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:06,738
Can I have a lick?

209
00:25:07,448 --> 00:25:09,199
Hurry, it's starting to melt.

210
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:13,745
It's yummy!

211
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:20,130
Come on.

212
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,311
Cheer up!

213
00:25:21,331 --> 00:25:22,492
Koichi is finally coming home today.

214
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:26,132
He'll be disappointed if you are all bummed out.

215
00:25:52,576 --> 00:25:54,869
Don't go down to the water anymore today.

216
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:55,954
OK.

217
00:26:22,231 --> 00:26:23,648
Sosuke.

218
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,442
Time to come in now.

219
00:26:26,902 --> 00:26:31,155
If I leave the pail here, Ponyo will know where we live when she comes back.

220
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,294
That's true.

221
00:26:33,314 --> 00:26:34,941
Do that if you want to, Sosuke.

222
00:26:35,035 --> 00:26:36,369
Yeah.

223
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:50,436
Sosuke, can you get that?

224
00:26:50,456 --> 00:26:52,041
It must be Koichi.

225
00:26:54,815 --> 00:26:55,810
Hello?

226
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,825
Yep.

227
00:26:56,845 --> 00:26:57,840
It's me.

228
00:26:58,694 --> 00:26:59,633
Yeah.

229
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:00,592
I'm doing fine.

230
00:27:00,696 --> 00:27:02,969
I can't come home tonight.

231
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:05,262
Help me with the signal when I pass offshore.

232
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:06,264
OK.

233
00:27:06,284 --> 00:27:07,181
I'll let you talk to Lisa.

234
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:09,893
Koichi?

235
00:27:09,913 --> 00:27:10,727
Yeah.

236
00:27:11,582 --> 00:27:12,729
What?!

237
00:27:12,749 --> 00:27:13,896
That's not fair...

238
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:15,063
Just say no!

239
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:19,162
Go ahead, abandon your wife and child up here on a cliff all alone.

240
00:27:19,256 --> 00:27:19,841
I give up!

241
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:20,446
Whatever!

242
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:27,327
Come on, Sosuke.

243
00:27:27,347 --> 00:27:28,453
Let's eat out tonight.

244
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,299
I wanna eat at home.

245
00:27:59,922 --> 00:28:01,264
That's Koichi.

246
00:28:01,284 --> 00:28:02,626
Lisa, it's Koichi's ship!

247
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:03,988
Turn off the lights!

248
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:29,681
That's Sosuke, what a genius!

249
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:31,641
He's only five years old!

250
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:33,903
Your wife must be pretty mad.

251
00:28:38,293 --> 00:28:38,899
S...

252
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:39,525
O...

253
00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:40,151
R...

254
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:40,777
R...

255
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:41,403
Y.

256
00:28:41,423 --> 00:28:42,029
Lisa, he's saying he's sorry.

257
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:43,147
B...

258
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:44,183
U...

259
00:28:44,203 --> 00:28:45,219
G...

260
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:46,255
O...

261
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:47,291
F...

262
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:48,327
F...

263
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:50,369
B-U-G O-F-F.

264
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:52,121
B-U-G O-F-F.

265
00:28:57,386 --> 00:28:59,137
Lisa, he says he loves you.

266
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:02,390
He says, "Lots and lots."

267
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:11,681
BUG OFF BUG OFF BUG OFF BUG OFF Wow!

268
00:29:11,701 --> 00:29:17,895
Isn't that pretty?

269
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:54,483
PRAYING FOR SAFE SAILING THANKS GOOD NIGHT Don't cry, Lisa.

270
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:56,330
I won't cry, either.

271
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,185
So...

272
00:29:58,488 --> 00:30:01,991
I promised Ponyo I'd protect her.

273
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:09,415
I wonder if she's crying now.

274
00:30:12,804 --> 00:30:14,244
All right.

275
00:30:14,264 --> 00:30:15,704
I'm gonna cheer up!

276
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:22,136
Happy as can be Don't you worry, Sosuke.

277
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:26,682
You did your best and Ponyo will be just fine.

278
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:28,726
OK.

279
00:30:30,155 --> 00:30:31,949
Now, let's eat dinner!

280
00:30:31,969 --> 00:30:33,763
We'll finish Koichi's portion, too!

281
00:30:43,617 --> 00:30:45,284
What have I done?

282
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:49,830
It was my fault that I had brought you to show you the work at the farm.

283
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:56,337
Have I not taught you over and over how the humans dirty up water and air?

284
00:30:56,431 --> 00:30:57,954
Come on, now.

285
00:30:57,974 --> 00:30:59,497
Eat.

286
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:01,040
Can't you hear me, Brunhilde?

287
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,928
I want ham!

288
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:08,652
Ham?

289
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:10,758
Where did you learn of such a horrifying thing!

290
00:31:10,852 --> 00:31:12,061
Tell me, Brunhilde.

291
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:14,387
My name is not Brunhilde.

292
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:16,138
It's Ponyo.

293
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:16,862
P...

294
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:17,501
P...

295
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:18,140
Ponyo?

296
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:19,455
Ponyo!

297
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:20,685
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

298
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:23,406
I will be a human, too!

299
00:31:24,293 --> 00:31:26,525
Human?

300
00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:28,777
What's good about such a foolish, horrid species?

301
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:32,415
All they do is to take life out of the ocean.

302
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:35,710
I was once, long ago, a human myself.

303
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:38,421
You have no idea what it took to give up being human...

304
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:40,548
I want hands!

305
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:44,176
I don't want these flippers anymore!

306
00:31:44,813 --> 00:31:47,128
- I want feet, like Sosuke!

307
00:31:47,148 --> 00:31:49,463
- That's enough!

308
00:32:08,754 --> 00:32:10,444
I made hands!

309
00:32:10,464 --> 00:32:12,154
I made feet, too!

310
00:32:12,716 --> 00:32:13,217
Yes!

311
00:32:13,237 --> 00:32:13,738
Hooray!

312
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:17,418
Don't tell me you have licked human blood!

313
00:32:17,512 --> 00:32:18,618
- I'm going to Sosuke!

314
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:19,744
- No!

315
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:23,257
The DNA contamination activated a congenital inferior factor!

316
00:32:23,352 --> 00:32:23,777
Revert.

317
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:24,222
Revert.

318
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:24,667
Revert!

319
00:32:24,687 --> 00:32:25,112
Revert!

320
00:32:25,132 --> 00:32:25,557
Revert!

321
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:26,002
Revert!

322
00:32:31,568 --> 00:32:32,132
There.

323
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:32,716
There.

324
00:32:32,736 --> 00:32:33,300
There.

325
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:33,884
There.

326
00:32:33,904 --> 00:32:34,468
Here we go!

327
00:32:38,408 --> 00:32:39,513
Oh, no.

328
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:40,638
I don't have enough power!

329
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:44,143
Let me out!

330
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,268
Let me out!

331
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:48,824
Let me out!

332
00:32:50,545 --> 00:32:51,609
Let me out!

333
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:52,693
Let me out!

334
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:55,498
Let me out!

335
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:58,376
Evil blood, calm down.

336
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:01,712
Be still, be still, be still, be still, be still.

337
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:12,756
She's already so powerful.

338
00:33:12,776 --> 00:33:14,466
Just like her mother.

339
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:23,067
If you could only remain innocent and pure forever.

340
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:47,258
I don't have the power to hold her for very long.

341
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:49,677
I need to ask for her mother's help now.

342
00:33:49,771 --> 00:33:50,418
I...

343
00:33:50,438 --> 00:33:51,085
What?

344
00:33:59,114 --> 00:34:00,303
Oh, no!

345
00:34:00,323 --> 00:34:01,512
They're headed for my elixirs.

346
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:03,084
Shoo!

347
00:34:03,104 --> 00:34:03,821
Shoo!

348
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:04,558
Get out of here!

349
00:34:04,661 --> 00:34:06,121
That was too close.

350
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:07,601
The anti-crab barrier was loose.

351
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:10,281
I must be careful not to upset the balance of nature.

352
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:10,876
Calm.

353
00:34:10,896 --> 00:34:11,397
I must remain calm.

354
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:14,785
When I think of meeting her again, my heart won't stop pounding.

355
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,111
Focus on work.

356
00:34:17,131 --> 00:34:18,612
This batch is already ready.

357
00:34:28,091 --> 00:34:29,967
The barrier is not loose in here, is it?

358
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:36,515
PANGEA 1907 This door still doesn't fit right.

359
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,397
I'll fix that next.

360
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,573
If even one living creature got in here...

361
00:35:16,858 --> 00:35:19,757
Yes.

362
00:35:19,777 --> 00:35:22,676
I can feel the power of the ocean in the furthest reaches of my DNA.

363
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:27,858
When this well is full, then the age of the ocean will begin again.

364
00:35:27,943 --> 00:35:31,111
An explosion of life to match the Cambrian Age.

365
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:33,697
An end to the era of those abominable humans.

366
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:40,788
This cursed door!

367
00:37:04,706 --> 00:37:06,123
Teeth!

368
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:16,258
Let's find Sosuke!

369
00:39:25,638 --> 00:39:28,140
I'm free!

370
00:39:47,629 --> 00:39:49,047
- Waterspout!

371
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:50,485
- Captain, look over there!

372
00:39:54,302 --> 00:39:56,743
- It's a tsunami!

373
00:39:56,763 --> 00:39:59,204
- Turn the ship into the wave!

374
00:39:59,307 --> 00:40:00,058
Look!

375
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:00,829
What is that?

376
00:40:05,845 --> 00:40:08,806
Captain, the radio and radar are both dead!

377
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:14,197
It's a little girl.

378
00:40:14,217 --> 00:40:15,969
Looks like she's about Sosuke's age.

379
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:30,582
- Thanks again.

380
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:31,638
- Sure.

381
00:40:31,658 --> 00:40:32,694
Take care.

382
00:40:33,842 --> 00:40:35,427
Why don't you wait here, Sosuke?

383
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:37,032
I'll stay with you.

384
00:40:37,136 --> 00:40:38,763
I'll take the shortcut, so I'll be OK.

385
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:40,410
Goodbye, Teacher.

386
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:41,839
Goodbye.

387
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:43,674
Be careful!

388
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,343
Sosuke, I'm sorry.

389
00:41:28,438 --> 00:41:29,856
The door didn't open, right?

390
00:41:29,876 --> 00:41:31,294
The power just went out.

391
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:32,338
- Everything OK at school?

392
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:33,297
- Yeah.

393
00:41:33,401 --> 00:41:35,091
Lisa, we'll be fine.

394
00:41:35,111 --> 00:41:36,801
So why don't you go home?

395
00:41:36,905 --> 00:41:37,551
But Ms.

396
00:41:37,571 --> 00:41:38,217
Kaneko is not here yet.

397
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:39,616
It'll be fine.

398
00:41:39,636 --> 00:41:40,929
She must be running a little late.

399
00:41:41,024 --> 00:41:43,984
We'll have to spend the night anyway.

400
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,653
If I were you, I'd get out of here while you still can.

401
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:49,501
- Sosuke, wait here for a while.

402
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:50,981
- OK.

403
00:42:02,003 --> 00:42:03,003
Hi, Yoshie.

404
00:42:04,057 --> 00:42:05,350
Oh, Sosuke.

405
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,663
Is that you?

406
00:42:06,768 --> 00:42:08,180
- It's so dark I could barely see.

407
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,612
- Here.

408
00:42:09,632 --> 00:42:11,044
This is for you.

409
00:42:13,691 --> 00:42:15,242
- Let's see...

410
00:42:15,262 --> 00:42:16,813
What is it?

411
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:18,384
- There's one for you, too, Noriko.

412
00:42:18,478 --> 00:42:19,811
Thank you.

413
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,345
It's pitch dark.

414
00:42:21,365 --> 00:42:22,471
I can't see a thing.

415
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:25,317
I can't believe the power is down from such little rain.

416
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:28,403
That's why I didn't want a sleepover.

417
00:42:32,043 --> 00:42:32,940
The power's back on!

418
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,857
Good!

419
00:42:33,962 --> 00:42:35,484
Nice and bright.

420
00:42:35,504 --> 00:42:37,026
It's a goldfish!

421
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:41,541
I bet the lights came back on because Sosuke's here.

422
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:46,713
The very powerful, micro-typhoon is still maintaining the power, and...

423
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:50,217
This stupid TV.

424
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:52,898
Nobody understands weather anymore.

425
00:42:52,918 --> 00:42:55,505
Their forecasts are never right.

426
00:42:55,598 --> 00:42:57,516
You should take your mother home now.

427
00:42:58,101 --> 00:43:02,980
With our lucky goldfish to keep us company, we won't be scared.

428
00:43:03,064 --> 00:43:04,064
OK.

429
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:13,407
This is for you, Toki.

430
00:43:17,171 --> 00:43:18,652
- It's wrinkled.

431
00:43:18,672 --> 00:43:20,153
What is it?

432
00:43:20,173 --> 00:43:21,654
- It goes like this.

433
00:43:24,345 --> 00:43:25,729
- I got it.

434
00:43:25,749 --> 00:43:27,133
It's a grasshopper.

435
00:43:27,153 --> 00:43:28,537
- No, it's the Koganei Maru.

436
00:43:28,631 --> 00:43:31,675
That's the name of your father's ship, isn't it, Sosuke?

437
00:43:31,769 --> 00:43:33,229
- Right.

438
00:43:33,249 --> 00:43:34,709
- It does look like a grasshopper.

439
00:43:35,231 --> 00:43:37,108
Sosuke, we've gotta get on the road.

440
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:39,005
Let's hurry now and say goodbye.

441
00:43:39,694 --> 00:43:41,648
- OK.

442
00:43:41,668 --> 00:43:43,622
Ladies, good evening.

443
00:43:43,642 --> 00:43:45,596
- Good evening.

444
00:43:46,399 --> 00:43:48,734
Be careful the wind doesn't blow you away.

445
00:43:49,944 --> 00:43:51,194
Get in from this side.

446
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:58,035
They said the phones are out, too.

447
00:44:21,768 --> 00:44:23,560
The ocean looks all puffed up.

448
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:29,941
You think the storm could sink the ships?

449
00:44:30,578 --> 00:44:32,017
No.

450
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:33,476
Ships can handle a storm.

451
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:34,935
I'm sure that's what Koichi is doing right now.

452
00:44:46,636 --> 00:44:47,783
I saw a fish!

453
00:44:47,803 --> 00:44:48,950
Did you see that, Lisa?

454
00:44:49,045 --> 00:44:50,128
Put your seatbelt on!

455
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:02,194
Lisa!

456
00:45:02,214 --> 00:45:03,299
You can't cross here!

457
00:45:03,402 --> 00:45:04,717
We just got word.

458
00:45:04,737 --> 00:45:06,052
They're gonna evacuate this side.

459
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:08,408
Evacuate?

460
00:45:08,428 --> 00:45:10,597
There are some people up at the senior center.

461
00:45:10,701 --> 00:45:12,724
They're on the leeward side, and the levees are high.

462
00:45:12,744 --> 00:45:14,767
They should be fine.

463
00:45:15,456 --> 00:45:16,645
OK.

464
00:45:16,665 --> 00:45:17,854
But right now, I need to get home.

465
00:45:18,376 --> 00:45:19,586
- You can't cross here.

466
00:45:19,606 --> 00:45:20,816
- Take the mountain road.

467
00:45:24,048 --> 00:45:24,883
- Here we go, Sosuke.

468
00:45:24,903 --> 00:45:25,738
- Sure.

469
00:45:27,135 --> 00:45:28,018
- No!

470
00:45:28,038 --> 00:45:28,921
Don't do it!

471
00:45:28,941 --> 00:45:29,824
- A big wave is coming!

472
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:37,853
- Lisa, you gotta get out of here!

473
00:45:37,873 --> 00:45:39,416
- Back up!

474
00:46:19,478 --> 00:46:21,022
- The fish are following us now!

475
00:46:21,042 --> 00:46:22,586
- Buckle up!

476
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,028
I'm gonna go real fast!

477
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:31,998
What a persistent wave!

478
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,605
- Lisa, the little girl just fell in!

479
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:44,710
- What?

480
00:47:44,804 --> 00:47:46,346
She was on a fish!

481
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,602
Where?

482
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:03,321
The sea level is raised!

483
00:48:03,406 --> 00:48:05,699
Sosuke, where did you see a little girl?

484
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:08,576
She was out there, running on top of a huge fish!

485
00:48:08,661 --> 00:48:09,828
A fish?

486
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,792
Sosuke, we have to go!

487
00:48:31,902 --> 00:48:33,362
Hang in there, Sosuke.

488
00:48:33,382 --> 00:48:34,842
We're almost home.

489
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:30,941
There is a little girl.

490
00:49:30,961 --> 00:49:32,192
It's dangerous out here!

491
00:49:32,286 --> 00:49:33,620
Come over here!

492
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:35,789
Stay there, Sosuke.

493
00:50:02,149 --> 00:50:04,150
Sosuke, do you know her?

494
00:50:25,673 --> 00:50:26,798
Ponyo?

495
00:50:27,852 --> 00:50:29,027
- Right!

496
00:50:29,047 --> 00:50:30,222
It's me, Ponyo!

497
00:50:30,242 --> 00:50:31,417
- It is you!

498
00:50:33,482 --> 00:50:35,359
Lisa!

499
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:37,256
Ponyo came back, and she's a little girl now!

500
00:50:48,696 --> 00:50:50,613
I found Sosuke!

501
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:12,177
Listen, Sosuke, Ponyo.

502
00:51:12,271 --> 00:51:13,856
All right.

503
00:51:13,876 --> 00:51:15,461
Life is mysterious and amazing.

504
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,348
But we need to be calm right now.

505
00:51:17,443 --> 00:51:18,319
- All right?

506
00:51:18,339 --> 00:51:19,215
- Yes.

507
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,310
Very good.

508
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:26,566
You can take off your raincoat now, Sosuke.

509
00:51:27,077 --> 00:51:28,287
You are... barefoot, Ponyo.

510
00:51:28,307 --> 00:51:29,517
Hold this for a sec.

511
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:36,326
Stay here, and I'll go get a towel.

512
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:54,719
Here, this way!

513
00:51:57,223 --> 00:51:59,015
It smells like you in here!

514
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,020
Ponyo!

515
00:52:08,901 --> 00:52:10,068
There, got ya.

516
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,362
Now, let's rub you down and dry you off.

517
00:52:16,617 --> 00:52:18,910
Ponyo, you have beautiful red hair.

518
00:52:21,882 --> 00:52:24,051
- And your clothes are dry.

519
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:26,240
- That's because Ponyo was a fish.

520
00:52:26,345 --> 00:52:28,035
- Being wet doesn't bother her, right?

521
00:52:28,055 --> 00:52:29,745
- Right.

522
00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:33,216
I really like this thing.

523
00:52:33,602 --> 00:52:35,145
All right then.

524
00:52:35,165 --> 00:52:36,708
Why don't we have some tea?

525
00:52:37,012 --> 00:52:39,556
Ponyo, will you hold the light for me?

526
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,507
- Coming!

527
00:52:41,527 --> 00:52:43,384
- Let's see if the water is working.

528
00:52:43,737 --> 00:52:44,613
- It's working!

529
00:52:44,633 --> 00:52:45,509
- It's working!

530
00:52:49,034 --> 00:52:49,869
- It worked!

531
00:52:49,889 --> 00:52:50,724
- It worked!

532
00:52:51,944 --> 00:52:54,612
It's because we have our own water tank up on the hill.

533
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:57,925
And who thinks the stove will light?

534
00:52:57,945 --> 00:52:59,412
And light!

535
00:52:59,432 --> 00:53:00,899
All right.

536
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:02,507
- All right!

537
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:04,029
- We have our own propane tank.

538
00:53:07,136 --> 00:53:08,971
- Please have a seat at the table.

539
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,826
- OK!

540
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,463
Ponyo, over here.

541
00:53:18,721 --> 00:53:20,179
This is what you do.

542
00:53:23,392 --> 00:53:24,934
Now, put your stuff down.

543
00:53:27,573 --> 00:53:29,220
- You need to use your hands.

544
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,887
- No, I'll use feet!

545
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:35,111
Look at that!

546
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,283
What is it?

547
00:53:40,586 --> 00:53:41,733
Look at her feet.

548
00:53:41,753 --> 00:53:42,900
They're just like hands.

549
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:03,973
Here you go.

550
00:54:05,768 --> 00:54:06,768
Here.

551
00:54:11,899 --> 00:54:13,149
Thank you for the tea!

552
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:03,199
Ah, that was delicious.

553
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:07,370
So, what shall we do next?

554
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:09,633
- Ponyo wants ham!

555
00:55:09,653 --> 00:55:11,488
- All she thinks about is ham, Lisa.

556
00:55:13,252 --> 00:55:15,253
I better make some dinner then.

557
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:18,464
But, first, we should start the generator.

558
00:55:19,758 --> 00:55:22,844
We generate power to talk to Koichi on the radio.

559
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:26,639
Koichi is my dad.

560
00:55:26,734 --> 00:55:28,173
- Is he an evil wizard?

561
00:55:28,193 --> 00:55:29,632
- No, of course not.

562
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:32,395
He's the captain of the ship called Koganei Maru.

563
00:55:32,479 --> 00:55:34,480
What about your dad, Ponyo?

564
00:55:34,992 --> 00:55:36,389
His name is Fujimoto.

565
00:55:36,409 --> 00:55:37,806
He keeps me in a bubble!

566
00:55:37,911 --> 00:55:39,371
- What?

567
00:55:39,391 --> 00:55:40,851
- So I ran away.

568
00:55:42,656 --> 00:55:44,157
What about your mom, then?

569
00:55:44,658 --> 00:55:47,744
I love my mom very much!

570
00:55:48,213 --> 00:55:50,132
- But she can be very scary.

571
00:55:50,152 --> 00:55:52,071
- Just like my mom.

572
00:55:57,254 --> 00:55:58,546
Ponyo, over here, please.

573
00:56:15,147 --> 00:56:17,857
I wonder if the fuel has gone bad.

574
00:56:18,452 --> 00:56:19,704
- Maybe it's clogged.

575
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:20,976
- It's clogged.

576
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:22,904
It's clogged over there.

577
00:56:38,555 --> 00:56:39,911
- It's on!

578
00:56:39,931 --> 00:56:41,287
- It's light now!

579
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:45,092
Ponyo, you're amazing.

580
00:57:03,413 --> 00:57:04,811
- Antenna, antenna!

581
00:57:04,831 --> 00:57:06,229
- Hey, Lisa.

582
00:57:06,323 --> 00:57:08,366
Did all the ships out there sink?

583
00:57:09,743 --> 00:57:11,494
I don't see any lights out there.

584
00:57:29,815 --> 00:57:31,254
- Too loud!

585
00:57:31,274 --> 00:57:32,713
- We can't get through?

586
00:57:33,976 --> 00:57:36,435
I can't get any reception.

587
00:57:37,573 --> 00:57:39,659
Transmitting from JA4LL.

588
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:41,765
JA4LL.

589
00:57:42,109 --> 00:57:43,401
Come in, Koichi.

590
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:46,362
This is Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.

591
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:48,406
We're all doing fine.

592
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,754
- We're about to have dinner.

593
00:57:51,774 --> 00:57:53,818
- Ham!

594
00:58:02,431 --> 00:58:03,453
Put the noodles in your bowl?

595
00:58:03,473 --> 00:58:04,495
Be careful.

596
00:58:04,515 --> 00:58:05,537
It's really hot.

597
00:58:21,867 --> 00:58:23,514
- You have to wait a little bit.

598
00:58:23,534 --> 00:58:25,181
- It takes three minutes.

599
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:41,834
OK, close your eyes.

600
00:58:43,045 --> 00:58:44,295
Not yet...

601
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:47,997
Ponyo...

602
00:58:48,017 --> 00:58:48,914
No peeking!

603
00:58:52,648 --> 00:58:53,524
OK.

604
00:58:53,544 --> 00:58:54,420
You can look now.

605
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:57,683
Abracadabra!

606
00:59:03,992 --> 00:59:05,307
- It's ham!

607
00:59:05,327 --> 00:59:06,642
- Careful, it's hot.

608
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:10,863
Hot, hot, hot!

609
00:59:28,215 --> 00:59:29,966
Lisa, Ponyo fell asleep.

610
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:39,850
Do you think Ponyo came from far, far away?

611
00:59:39,935 --> 00:59:41,602
Yeah, I do.

612
00:59:57,462 --> 00:59:58,797
Look outside.

613
00:59:58,817 --> 01:00:00,152
It looks like the waves have calmed down.

614
01:00:01,508 --> 01:00:03,051
- Maybe because Ponyo fell asleep.

615
01:00:03,071 --> 01:00:04,614
- Do you see that light?

616
01:00:12,436 --> 01:00:13,917
It's moving.

617
01:00:13,937 --> 01:00:15,418
There must be somebody still over there.

618
01:00:15,512 --> 01:00:17,513
I wonder if that's Yoshie and the others.

619
01:00:24,114 --> 01:00:25,366
- The lights are out.

620
01:00:25,386 --> 01:00:26,638
- It's the mountain road.

621
01:00:30,777 --> 01:00:32,695
Sosuke, stay with Ponyo, OK?

622
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,458
I've gotta go help them.

623
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:47,668
I can get there if I take the mountain road.

624
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:53,466
Sosuke, I should go to the senior center.

625
01:00:53,675 --> 01:00:54,842
I'm coming, too.

626
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:58,095
I'd feel better if you'd stay up here with Ponyo.

627
01:00:58,398 --> 01:01:00,025
I'm coming with you!

628
01:01:00,045 --> 01:01:01,672
We just need to bring Ponyo with us.

629
01:01:02,184 --> 01:01:03,476
I wanna go with you, Lisa!

630
01:01:06,104 --> 01:01:09,940
Sosuke, right now, our house is a beacon in the storm.

631
01:01:10,025 --> 01:01:14,153
The people in the dark feel hopeful when they see our lights.

632
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,113
That's why someone has to be here.

633
01:01:17,115 --> 01:01:19,283
Many mysterious things have been happening.

634
01:01:19,367 --> 01:01:23,621
We don't know why right now, but we'll find out before long.

635
01:01:23,705 --> 01:01:26,874
For now, I'm worried about the people at the senior center.

636
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:31,337
If you stay and guard the house, that would be very helpful.

637
01:01:31,431 --> 01:01:32,912
Don't worry.

638
01:01:32,932 --> 01:01:34,413
I promise I'll be back.

639
01:01:35,717 --> 01:01:37,426
Promise?

640
01:01:38,522 --> 01:01:40,003
- I promise.

641
01:01:40,023 --> 01:01:41,504
- You promised.

642
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:43,933
I love you, Sosuke.

643
01:02:38,665 --> 01:02:40,230
The moon is out!

644
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,815
I can see the lights of a city up ahead.

645
01:02:42,294 --> 01:02:43,754
Thank goodness!

646
01:02:43,774 --> 01:02:45,234
We can get our bearings again.

647
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,663
We're someplace I've never seen before.

648
01:02:53,753 --> 01:02:56,630
Have we arrived in America or what?

649
01:03:14,201 --> 01:03:16,036
That's not a mountain.

650
01:03:16,056 --> 01:03:17,891
And that's no harbor, either.

651
01:03:17,986 --> 01:03:19,361
Those lights are ships.

652
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:32,208
The water of the ocean has come together to create a mountain.

653
01:03:32,918 --> 01:03:34,919
That's probably a graveyard for ships.

654
01:03:35,003 --> 01:03:37,254
The gate to the world beyond must have opened!

655
01:03:42,395 --> 01:03:43,897
- The engine stopped!

656
01:03:43,917 --> 01:03:45,419
- Try to hold her steady.

657
01:03:45,523 --> 01:03:46,587
- Drop the sea anchor.

658
01:03:46,607 --> 01:03:47,671
- Yes, sir.

659
01:04:01,488 --> 01:04:03,280
Something's coming from behind us.

660
01:04:31,268 --> 01:04:32,851
I just saw the Goddess of Mercy!

661
01:04:43,373 --> 01:04:44,666
- The engine's working.

662
01:04:44,686 --> 01:04:45,979
- We're saved!

663
01:04:46,084 --> 01:04:47,649
She saved us!

664
01:04:47,669 --> 01:04:49,234
She must've appeared for us!

665
01:04:49,327 --> 01:04:52,871
Thank you for protecting us...

666
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,525
Higher, higher.

667
01:05:35,248 --> 01:05:37,750
There is a powerful holy barrier around the house.

668
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:40,169
How has she learned to do something like that?

669
01:05:57,864 --> 01:05:59,386
I don't believe this!

670
01:05:59,406 --> 01:06:00,928
She's turned into a human!

671
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:02,334
Hold still!

672
01:06:02,354 --> 01:06:03,529
You...

673
01:06:03,549 --> 01:06:04,724
What are you doing?

674
01:06:12,796 --> 01:06:14,110
Girls!

675
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:15,444
Oh, no!

676
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:19,833
Stop, now!

677
01:06:27,644 --> 01:06:29,083
Listen, girls.

678
01:06:29,103 --> 01:06:30,542
I'm concerned about your sister.

679
01:06:36,393 --> 01:06:39,395
At last, she has finally come.

680
01:07:16,192 --> 01:07:17,735
- Fujimoto.

681
01:07:17,755 --> 01:07:19,298
- You've come for me, my love.

682
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:22,146
What a wonderful ocean.

683
01:07:26,327 --> 01:07:28,809
It's full of magic and power.

684
01:07:28,829 --> 01:07:31,311
It's like my ancient Devonian Sea.

685
01:07:31,823 --> 01:07:33,824
Ponyo has tasted human blood.

686
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:37,453
She also drank all of my elixirs that I've collected.

687
01:07:38,298 --> 01:07:39,966
Ponyo?

688
01:07:39,986 --> 01:07:41,654
What a lovely name.

689
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:49,423
Of course, it's all my fault, really.

690
01:07:50,008 --> 01:07:54,470
She can use magic freely, and she's opened a hole in the fabric of reality.

691
01:07:54,554 --> 01:07:57,222
She has no idea what she's doing.

692
01:07:57,442 --> 01:08:00,195
She's now a little girl.

693
01:08:00,215 --> 01:08:02,968
And she loves a little boy.

694
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:07,107
If we don't do anything about this, the planet is doomed.

695
01:08:16,284 --> 01:08:19,244
Already the Earth is pulling satellites from the sky.

696
01:08:19,329 --> 01:08:21,788
And the moon pulls the sea closer...

697
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:24,208
Be calm, dear.

698
01:08:31,976 --> 01:08:34,062
Sosuke.

699
01:08:34,082 --> 01:08:36,168
The boy's name is Sosuke.

700
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:43,352
You all love your older sister, don't you?

701
01:08:46,648 --> 01:08:49,983
Listen, my darling, why don't we let Ponyo become human for good?

702
01:08:50,078 --> 01:08:51,225
- What?

703
01:08:51,245 --> 01:08:52,392
- It's the old magic, you know.

704
01:08:53,071 --> 01:08:57,866
If Sosuke's love remains unchanged, Ponyo'll become human and lose her magical power.

705
01:08:57,951 --> 01:09:02,579
But, if anything goes wrong, Ponyo will turn into sea foam.

706
01:09:03,081 --> 01:09:06,625
Well, we all originated in sea foam.

707
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,159
But he is only five years old.

708
01:09:08,179 --> 01:09:09,619
That's impossible...

709
01:09:15,134 --> 01:09:18,345
Children, sleep peacefully for now.

710
01:09:31,818 --> 01:09:35,904
Sosuke!

711
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:38,031
Ponyo, you OK?

712
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:43,277
- Ponyo, good morning.

713
01:09:43,297 --> 01:09:45,404
- Good morning, Sosuke.

714
01:09:51,806 --> 01:09:52,849
Look at that.

715
01:09:52,869 --> 01:09:53,912
The ocean is at our door.

716
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:19,813
- How come your Lisa's not here?

717
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:21,856
- Because the road is under the water.

718
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,369
Too bad we don't have a boat.

719
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:29,458
There's a boat, right there!

720
01:10:31,763 --> 01:10:32,952
- You can't ride it.

721
01:10:32,972 --> 01:10:34,161
- Yes, you can.

722
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,688
Thank you!

723
01:10:53,576 --> 01:10:55,036
Wow!

724
01:10:55,056 --> 01:10:56,516
You even made the candle bigger.

725
01:10:56,621 --> 01:10:57,546
- We can ride it!

726
01:10:57,566 --> 01:10:58,491
- Yeah!

727
01:10:58,511 --> 01:10:59,436
This is fantastic.

728
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:00,833
- Fantastic!

729
01:11:00,853 --> 01:11:02,146
- You take that end, please.

730
01:11:02,241 --> 01:11:03,241
OK!

731
01:11:06,005 --> 01:11:07,257
- Ready?

732
01:11:07,277 --> 01:11:08,529
- I'm ready!

733
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:22,928
It actually floats!

734
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:27,933
Doesn't look like it has any leaks.

735
01:11:28,361 --> 01:11:30,780
Now we have to fill the boiler.

736
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,219
The water goes in through this pipe...

737
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:36,733
...then it gets heated up here, in this round thing.

738
01:12:04,178 --> 01:12:05,846
It's like a rocket.

739
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,813
Ponyo, everything's shipshape.

740
01:12:14,907 --> 01:12:15,783
- Shipshape!

741
01:12:15,803 --> 01:12:16,679
- Yep.

742
01:12:16,784 --> 01:12:17,952
- Shipshape!

743
01:12:17,972 --> 01:12:19,140
- Shipshape.

744
01:12:19,245 --> 01:12:20,080
Shipshape!

745
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:20,935
Shipshape!

746
01:12:20,955 --> 01:12:21,790
Shipshape!

747
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:22,645
Shipshape!

748
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:23,739
Shipshape!

749
01:12:45,104 --> 01:12:46,106
Is it hot?

750
01:12:46,126 --> 01:12:47,128
It's hot!

751
01:12:52,351 --> 01:12:53,435
Hot!

752
01:12:57,158 --> 01:12:58,472
- Look at that!

753
01:12:58,492 --> 01:12:59,806
- It's burning.

754
01:12:59,911 --> 01:13:00,662
It's hot!

755
01:13:00,682 --> 01:13:01,433
It's hot!

756
01:13:01,453 --> 01:13:02,204
It's hot!

757
01:13:02,224 --> 01:13:02,975
It's hot!

758
01:13:10,995 --> 01:13:12,621
It's hot, right?

759
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:24,966
It's working!

760
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:29,429
Sosuke, we're shipshape, right?

761
01:13:29,524 --> 01:13:30,463
- Yep.

762
01:13:30,483 --> 01:13:31,422
- This is fantastic.

763
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,056
- Sosuke!

764
01:13:40,076 --> 01:13:40,932
We're happy, right?

765
01:13:40,952 --> 01:13:41,808
- Yep.

766
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:43,747
- Sosuke, it's burning, right?

767
01:13:43,767 --> 01:13:45,144
- Yep.

768
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:47,739
Sosuke, that thing is hot, right?

769
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:50,358
Ponyo, you be the boat's lookout.

770
01:13:50,378 --> 01:13:52,193
And I'll do the steering, OK?

771
01:13:52,755 --> 01:13:53,590
OK!

772
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:54,445
I'm the lookout!

773
01:14:21,524 --> 01:14:22,774
There's the road.

774
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:25,193
That's the mountain road Lisa took last night.

775
01:14:27,707 --> 01:14:29,104
- I don't see her anywhere.

776
01:14:29,124 --> 01:14:30,521
- We'll see her.

777
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:32,993
She promised me she'd come back.

778
01:14:37,884 --> 01:14:39,552
Those are ancient fish.

779
01:14:39,572 --> 01:14:41,240
They lived during the Devonian Age.

780
01:14:41,345 --> 01:14:42,680
I know that one.

781
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,035
It's Bothriocephalus.

782
01:14:48,644 --> 01:14:49,833
- And that one is...

783
01:14:49,853 --> 01:14:51,042
- Dipnorhynchus.

784
01:14:51,147 --> 01:14:52,475
- Dipnorhynchus!

785
01:14:52,495 --> 01:14:53,823
- Wow!

786
01:14:53,843 --> 01:14:55,171
That one's really huge!

787
01:14:55,276 --> 01:14:56,694
- That's Devonynchus!

788
01:14:56,714 --> 01:14:58,132
- Devonynchus!

789
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:10,155
Ahoy!

790
01:15:10,249 --> 01:15:11,209
- Ahoy...

791
01:15:11,229 --> 01:15:12,189
- Whoa, there's a boat!

792
01:15:13,284 --> 01:15:14,910
Ahoy!

793
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:17,579
They said, "Ahoy."

794
01:15:18,998 --> 01:15:20,916
Ahoy!

795
01:15:26,797 --> 01:15:27,881
That's fast!

796
01:15:31,177 --> 01:15:32,594
I'm getting the hang of this.

797
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:37,933
Get ready to stop, Ponyo.

798
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,222
- Hello, you two.

799
01:15:45,242 --> 01:15:46,264
- Hello.

800
01:15:46,359 --> 01:15:48,902
Hey, that is quite a boat you got there.

801
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:50,811
I've seen you before.

802
01:15:50,831 --> 01:15:52,312
You're Lisa's little boy, aren't you?

803
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:53,842
- He's not a little boy.

804
01:15:53,862 --> 01:15:55,079
He's Sosuke!

805
01:15:55,099 --> 01:15:56,316
- She's Ponyo.

806
01:15:57,787 --> 01:15:59,955
And I used to be a fish.

807
01:16:00,331 --> 01:16:01,623
A fish?

808
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:04,459
Your name is lovely, Ponyo.

809
01:16:06,796 --> 01:16:08,838
By the way, have you seen my mother?

810
01:16:08,933 --> 01:16:10,685
Your mother?

811
01:16:10,705 --> 01:16:12,457
Why isn't your mother with you?

812
01:16:12,979 --> 01:16:14,397
- She went to the senior center.

813
01:16:14,417 --> 01:16:15,835
- Wow, way up there?

814
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:17,472
This is our baby.

815
01:16:47,513 --> 01:16:48,493
Oh, dear.

816
01:16:48,513 --> 01:16:49,493
I wonder what's wrong.

817
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:57,846
Oh, is that for us?

818
01:17:11,527 --> 01:17:13,028
Let me have it.

819
01:17:18,002 --> 01:17:19,649
Thank you.

820
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:21,316
I'm looking forward to tasting it.

821
01:17:24,749 --> 01:17:27,083
Wow, that's good soup.

822
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,513
- My mom made it.

823
01:17:29,533 --> 01:17:31,326
- The soup's for the baby!

824
01:17:32,131 --> 01:17:34,090
Oh, I'm sorry.

825
01:17:34,185 --> 01:17:37,772
He's too young to have soup.

826
01:17:37,792 --> 01:17:41,379
But I could eat the soup instead, and it would help me make milk for him.

827
01:17:43,601 --> 01:17:45,894
Yeah, my mom made milk for me, too.

828
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:49,731
Ponyo, is it all right if I eat the soup?

829
01:17:49,825 --> 01:17:51,432
- That's fine.

830
01:17:51,452 --> 01:17:53,059
- Thank you.

831
01:17:54,361 --> 01:17:55,862
Heave-ho!

832
01:17:57,124 --> 01:17:59,043
Heave-ho!

833
01:17:59,063 --> 01:18:00,982
Heave-ho!

834
01:18:02,828 --> 01:18:04,329
Heave-ho!

835
01:18:10,971 --> 01:18:12,681
People from the town!

836
01:18:12,701 --> 01:18:14,411
It's just like a parade!

837
01:18:14,809 --> 01:18:17,082
Ahoy!

838
01:18:17,102 --> 01:18:19,375
Are any of you in need of assistance at this time?

839
01:18:19,772 --> 01:18:22,170
Thank you!

840
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:24,588
We're fine for now!

841
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:27,936
We are taking everyone to the Mountain Peak Hotel!

842
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:30,730
For your safety, we request that you follow us!

843
01:18:30,825 --> 01:18:31,952
Aye, aye!

844
01:18:31,972 --> 01:18:33,099
Will do!

845
01:18:35,412 --> 01:18:36,789
- Looks like the whole town is here.

846
01:18:36,809 --> 01:18:38,186
- I'm glad.

847
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:39,750
- I hope everyone's OK.

848
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:41,230
- Ponyo, time to light the candle.

849
01:18:41,335 --> 01:18:42,315
Hold on a second.

850
01:18:42,335 --> 01:18:43,315
Let's see...

851
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:50,416
Here, have some milk.

852
01:18:51,001 --> 01:18:52,001
Wow.

853
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:54,546
It's for milk.

854
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:57,173
She already ate all the ham off those sandwiches.

855
01:18:57,268 --> 01:18:58,790
Thank you.

856
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:00,332
It'll help me make good milk.

857
01:19:00,427 --> 01:19:01,427
Sosuke.

858
01:19:02,106 --> 01:19:03,389
- I have a used candle.

859
01:19:03,409 --> 01:19:04,692
Do you want it?

860
01:19:04,712 --> 01:19:05,995
- Thanks.

861
01:19:06,015 --> 01:19:07,298
Ponyo will make it bigger.

862
01:19:07,393 --> 01:19:08,393
Thank you!

863
01:19:09,238 --> 01:19:10,177
- Be careful.

864
01:19:10,197 --> 01:19:11,136
- Thank you.

865
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:18,945
What's the matter?

866
01:19:23,878 --> 01:19:24,358
There.

867
01:19:24,378 --> 01:19:24,858
There.

868
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:45,722
Ponyo!

869
01:19:58,996 --> 01:20:00,331
- Sosuke!

870
01:20:00,351 --> 01:20:01,686
- Hey, that's Sosuke.

871
01:20:02,499 --> 01:20:03,855
- Where is Lisa?

872
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:05,231
- What's going on with Lisa?

873
01:20:05,336 --> 01:20:07,004
She went to the senior center last night!

874
01:20:07,024 --> 01:20:08,692
We're on our way to find her!

875
01:20:08,787 --> 01:20:11,998
That means Lisa beat that wave!

876
01:20:12,092 --> 01:20:13,636
- That's Lisa.

877
01:20:13,656 --> 01:20:15,200
- Sosuke, can I ride with you?

878
01:20:15,888 --> 01:20:17,223
Kumiko, I'm busy right now.

879
01:20:17,243 --> 01:20:18,578
Maybe later.

880
01:20:18,682 --> 01:20:20,476
Check the park.

881
01:20:20,496 --> 01:20:22,290
The seniors should be there by now.

882
01:20:22,394 --> 01:20:23,500
- Good luck, kid!

883
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,626
- You'll find her!

884
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:29,265
We'll send a boat for the seniors as soon as we drop this group off!

885
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:31,226
Good luck, captain!

886
01:21:20,192 --> 01:21:22,944
Ponyo, we need to replace the candle.

887
01:21:26,792 --> 01:21:28,357
We'll be OK.

888
01:21:28,377 --> 01:21:29,942
The fisherman gave me another one.

889
01:21:30,995 --> 01:21:31,995
Hot!

890
01:21:32,413 --> 01:21:33,788
It's still pretty hot.

891
01:21:38,961 --> 01:21:41,170
Bye-bye.

892
01:21:42,516 --> 01:21:44,059
Here, Ponyo.

893
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:45,622
Can you make this bigger?

894
01:21:46,051 --> 01:21:47,176
All right.

895
01:21:53,142 --> 01:21:55,977
Ponyo, are you sleepy?

896
01:22:03,068 --> 01:22:04,110
Ponyo.

897
01:22:20,304 --> 01:22:21,139
Ponyo.

898
01:22:21,159 --> 01:22:21,994
Ponyo!

899
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:20,885
Oh, good.

900
01:23:20,905 --> 01:23:22,010
I can walk from here.

901
01:23:48,882 --> 01:23:50,091
There's the road.

902
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:03,532
Oh, no!

903
01:24:03,552 --> 01:24:04,094
The boat!

904
01:24:05,899 --> 01:24:27,962
Ponyo!

905
01:24:29,131 --> 01:24:31,174
Ponyo, wake up!

906
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:35,094
Sosuke.

907
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,144
You scared me.

908
01:24:43,228 --> 01:24:45,813
I thought you might turn back into a goldfish.

909
01:24:58,629 --> 01:25:00,256
Lisa's car!

910
01:25:00,276 --> 01:25:01,903
Ponyo, I found Lisa's car!

911
01:25:06,011 --> 01:25:07,304
Lisa!

912
01:25:07,324 --> 01:25:08,617
Lisa!

913
01:25:11,173 --> 01:25:21,349
Lisa!

914
01:25:23,101 --> 01:25:24,101
Lisa...

915
01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:27,355
Lisa.

916
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:36,697
Lisa!

917
01:26:05,227 --> 01:26:07,603
Sosuke, I've got your boat.

918
01:26:07,688 --> 01:26:10,398
There's water coming from your eyes.

919
01:26:17,291 --> 01:26:18,751
- Let's go find your mom.

920
01:26:18,771 --> 01:26:20,231
- Yeah.

921
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:05,443
HIMAWARI HOUSE - My lap blanket!

922
01:27:05,463 --> 01:27:09,446
- Forget about it!

923
01:27:09,541 --> 01:27:11,959
Look, here comes a whale again!

924
01:27:12,044 --> 01:27:13,753
I think he sees us.

925
01:27:13,837 --> 01:27:15,755
The other side is nice, isn't it?

926
01:27:15,849 --> 01:27:17,309
- And my knees don't hurt.

927
01:27:17,329 --> 01:27:18,789
- We didn't have to be afraid.

928
01:27:18,894 --> 01:27:20,271
This is the other side?

929
01:27:20,291 --> 01:27:21,668
I thought it was the undersea palace!

930
01:27:24,348 --> 01:27:27,475
Ladies, can we gather around, please?

931
01:27:27,569 --> 01:27:29,092
- Coming!

932
01:27:29,112 --> 01:27:30,635
- Let's go!

933
01:27:33,367 --> 01:27:34,889
- It's so nice to run.

934
01:27:34,909 --> 01:27:36,431
- Beat you there!

935
01:27:40,697 --> 01:27:41,989
Winner!

936
01:27:47,496 --> 01:27:49,246
Everyone, quiet, please.

937
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:55,252
The time has come for you to bear witness to a sacred test of love.

938
01:27:55,347 --> 01:27:56,786
- Oh, how exciting!

939
01:27:56,806 --> 01:27:58,245
- Test of love!

940
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:00,132
My heart is beating fast!

941
01:28:02,396 --> 01:28:04,398
Please, ladies!

942
01:28:04,418 --> 01:28:06,420
You're the witnesses to this sacred test.

943
01:28:06,515 --> 01:28:09,016
We ask everyone to be patient for a little while longer.

944
01:28:10,394 --> 01:28:14,730
Fujimoto, you won't let any harm come to Sosuke or Ponyo, will you?

945
01:28:14,825 --> 01:28:15,861
- Right.

946
01:28:15,881 --> 01:28:16,917
- Of course not!

947
01:28:16,937 --> 01:28:17,973
He's the father...

948
01:28:18,068 --> 01:28:19,151
Of course I wouldn't.

949
01:28:20,539 --> 01:28:21,916
My hope is Ponyo will stay asleep.

950
01:28:21,936 --> 01:28:23,313
Excuse me.

951
01:28:32,634 --> 01:28:35,032
- I'm sure he's nice at heart.

952
01:28:35,052 --> 01:28:37,450
- I wonder how Lisa's doing?

953
01:28:37,546 --> 01:28:42,341
She's with Ponyo's mother, and they've been talking all night and day.

954
01:28:50,402 --> 01:28:51,674
Poor Lisa.

955
01:28:51,694 --> 01:28:52,966
Must be hard on her.

956
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:55,813
I wish we could hear what they're talking about.

957
01:28:55,907 --> 01:28:57,179
Oh, why don't we just ask.

958
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:58,471
Lisa!

959
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:01,902
Lisa!

960
01:29:07,367 --> 01:29:13,956
Please know that we are all cheering for Sosuke and Ponyo!

961
01:29:27,773 --> 01:29:29,025
- Lisa!

962
01:29:29,045 --> 01:29:30,297
- You must be anxious.

963
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:31,610
Sosuke'll do just fine.

964
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:32,840
He's a determined, young boy.

965
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:33,934
Absolutely!

966
01:29:34,019 --> 01:29:35,394
He's such an upstanding boy.

967
01:29:36,323 --> 01:29:37,741
Thank you.

968
01:29:37,761 --> 01:29:39,179
Please be there for him.

969
01:29:39,274 --> 01:29:40,858
It's going to be fine.

970
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:50,367
Ponyo, there's a tunnel.

971
01:29:50,911 --> 01:30:07,968
MOUNTAIN PEAK PARK AHEAD STOP I think I've been here before.

972
01:30:09,481 --> 01:30:11,274
- Ponyo?

973
01:30:11,294 --> 01:30:13,087
- Don't like this place.

974
01:30:17,155 --> 01:30:18,824
- Don't let go of my hand.

975
01:30:18,844 --> 01:30:20,513
- OK.

976
01:30:57,102 --> 01:31:27,923
Ponyo!

977
01:31:49,915 --> 01:31:51,174
Ponyo!

978
01:31:51,194 --> 01:31:52,453
Please don't die!

979
01:31:52,473 --> 01:31:53,732
Ponyo!

980
01:31:55,086 --> 01:31:56,296
Ponyo!

981
01:31:56,316 --> 01:31:57,526
Wake up, Ponyo!

982
01:31:58,705 --> 01:32:00,247
Be careful not to wake her.

983
01:32:01,426 --> 01:32:03,199
It's good to meet you, Sosuke.

984
01:32:03,219 --> 01:32:04,992
We've all been waiting for you.

985
01:32:05,096 --> 01:32:06,931
- The old ladies, your mother...

986
01:32:06,951 --> 01:32:08,786
- My mother?

987
01:32:08,892 --> 01:32:10,665
Won't you come with me and join them, Sosuke?

988
01:32:10,685 --> 01:32:12,458
Ponyo, too.

989
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:18,182
Let Ponyo keep sleeping and we'll just sneak away.

990
01:32:18,276 --> 01:32:20,925
Sosuke!

991
01:32:20,945 --> 01:32:23,594
Sosuke, don't listen to that wacko!

992
01:32:24,147 --> 01:32:27,399
He tricked all the others into going with him!

993
01:32:27,494 --> 01:32:28,954
- Toki!

994
01:32:28,974 --> 01:32:30,434
- Nobody fools me!

995
01:32:31,237 --> 01:32:34,406
Like I said, there is so little time!

996
01:32:35,075 --> 01:32:36,784
Can't you see that?

997
01:32:36,868 --> 01:32:40,371
If the moon comes any closer, there will be no going back!

998
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:43,791
If you're gonna lie, come up with a better one!

999
01:32:43,885 --> 01:32:45,199
- Sosuke, come to me!

1000
01:32:45,219 --> 01:32:46,533
- Humans!

1001
01:32:46,795 --> 01:32:48,712
Listen, Sosuke, please come with me!

1002
01:32:48,797 --> 01:32:50,881
You're the only one who can save the planet.

1003
01:32:50,966 --> 01:32:52,466
I don't want to use force.

1004
01:32:53,802 --> 01:32:54,927
Ponyo!

1005
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:59,306
What a horrible thing to do to your father!

1006
01:33:06,032 --> 01:33:08,076
- Ponyo!

1007
01:33:08,096 --> 01:33:10,140
- Sosuke, come on!

1008
01:33:10,235 --> 01:33:11,777
Bring them to me!

1009
01:33:17,492 --> 01:33:18,826
You can do it!

1010
01:33:21,246 --> 01:33:22,746
Jump for it!

1011
01:34:02,287 --> 01:34:03,328
Girls!

1012
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,563
- Lisa!

1013
01:34:59,583 --> 01:35:00,626
- Sosuke.

1014
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:01,762
Ponyo!

1015
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:10,562
Where am I?

1016
01:35:20,792 --> 01:35:22,669
- So this is Sosuke.

1017
01:35:22,689 --> 01:35:24,566
- How do you do?

1018
01:35:24,671 --> 01:35:26,173
- Are you Ponyo's mother?

1019
01:35:26,193 --> 01:35:27,695
- Yes.

1020
01:35:27,799 --> 01:35:30,239
You brought my daughter safely here.

1021
01:35:30,259 --> 01:35:32,699
Thank you.

1022
01:35:33,461 --> 01:35:34,753
Sosuke.

1023
01:35:34,838 --> 01:35:38,799
Ponyo opened a magic well because she wants very much to be human.

1024
01:35:39,801 --> 01:35:46,557
For her to become human, she needs you to accept and love her as she truly is.

1025
01:35:47,267 --> 01:35:51,478
You know that Ponyo was a fish, don't you?

1026
01:35:52,814 --> 01:35:56,608
She became half human when she licked your blood.

1027
01:35:56,703 --> 01:35:58,997
Oh, I see...

1028
01:35:59,017 --> 01:36:01,311
I cut my thumb, then Ponyo licked it and made it better.

1029
01:36:01,406 --> 01:36:03,991
So that's how she changed into a human.

1030
01:36:04,951 --> 01:36:08,620
Do you care if Ponyo is half fish and half human?

1031
01:36:09,048 --> 01:36:12,219
I love Ponyo as a fish, half-fish and fully human.

1032
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:15,410
I love her in all forms.

1033
01:36:29,767 --> 01:36:32,060
Ponyo, come here, please.

1034
01:36:46,576 --> 01:36:51,205
Ponyo, Sosuke will be your guardian.

1035
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,669
To become human, you must choose to abandon magic.

1036
01:36:57,754 --> 01:36:59,379
Can you do that?

1037
01:37:00,173 --> 01:37:01,173
Yes!

1038
01:37:10,068 --> 01:37:13,947
Kiss the bubble, when you return to land, and Ponyo will become a girl.

1039
01:37:13,967 --> 01:37:17,846
Five years old, just like you.

1040
01:37:21,110 --> 01:37:23,111
I'm happy for you, Ponyo.

1041
01:37:24,072 --> 01:37:26,615
Thank you very much, Ponyo's mother.

1042
01:37:32,622 --> 01:37:36,291
Everyone, the balance of nature is restored.

1043
01:37:39,754 --> 01:37:41,463
Way to go!

1044
01:37:47,262 --> 01:37:48,762
My Sosuke.

1045
01:38:13,288 --> 01:38:15,122
Thank you, Lisa.

1046
01:38:15,425 --> 01:38:16,843
Thank you.

1047
01:38:16,863 --> 01:38:18,281
I'll take care of her.

1048
01:38:29,647 --> 01:38:31,044
Everyone!

1049
01:38:31,064 --> 01:38:32,461
Are you all right?

1050
01:38:37,989 --> 01:38:39,415
- Wait, let me get your wheelchairs!

1051
01:38:39,435 --> 01:38:40,861
- Don't bother.

1052
01:38:40,881 --> 01:38:42,307
We like to walk.

1053
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,276
Life begins again.

1054
01:38:47,822 --> 01:38:49,698
This is your ship, I believe.

1055
01:38:52,086 --> 01:38:54,297
- Thank you.

1056
01:38:54,317 --> 01:38:56,528
- Sorry for everything.

1057
01:38:56,632 --> 01:38:57,196
If you will.

1058
01:38:57,216 --> 01:38:57,780
May I?

1059
01:39:03,338 --> 01:39:05,005
Take care of Ponyo.

1060
01:39:07,759 --> 01:39:09,259
It's Koichi's ship!

1061
01:39:13,941 --> 01:39:15,686
Koichi!

1062
01:39:15,706 --> 01:39:17,451
Hi!

1063
01:39:17,471 --> 01:39:19,216
Over here!

1064
01:39:19,322 --> 01:39:21,012
It's Lisa!

1065
01:39:21,032 --> 01:39:22,722
And Sosuke's there, too!

1066
01:39:23,149 --> 01:39:24,816
Ahoy!

1067
01:39:24,901 --> 01:39:27,819
Look, Ponyo, there's Koichi's ship!

1068
01:41:12,425 --> 01:41:18,430
THE END
