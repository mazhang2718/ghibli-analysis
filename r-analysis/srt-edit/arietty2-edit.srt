1
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:57,183
It's funny how you wake up each day and never really know if it will be one that will change your life forever.

2
00:00:58,143 --> 00:00:59,853
But that's what this day was.

3
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:03,982
The day I left the city to spend a week in the house where my mother grew up.

4
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,401
A day I'll never forget.

5
00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:12,501
So many years have passed Almost there.

6
00:01:12,521 --> 00:01:18,528
Feeling all right?

7
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,373
I'm okay.

8
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:39,403
I left my childhood In a garden green Come in the garden And look at the trees I used to play there when I was a child Oh, Hara.

9
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:56,399
How many times have I told her?

10
00:01:57,545 --> 00:01:58,387
Wait here.

11
00:01:58,407 --> 00:01:59,249
All right?

12
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:00,111
I won't be a minute.

13
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:01,372
Okay.

14
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:06,451
Hara!

15
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,537
Your car's blocking the driveway again.

16
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:55,604
So many years have passed The dew is still on the roses I left my childhood In a garden green Shawn?

17
00:02:55,624 --> 00:03:41,671
Where are you?

18
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:51,899
Shawn?

19
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:54,360
I'm here, Aunt Jessica.

20
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,030
Come meet Hara!

21
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:41,783
Supper is done and night has come Let's have tea together near the fireplace Nice try.

22
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:58,758
My house, my home ls so small, so pretty My mom, my dad We are family Joy everywhere Hey, back off!

23
00:05:01,062 --> 00:05:01,959
Hey!

24
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:02,876
Go get your own!

25
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,992
Arrietty!

26
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,160
What?

27
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:28,788
You went outside again, didn't you?

28
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:31,281
How many times have I...

29
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,658
What happened to your room?

30
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,419
It's my own little garden.

31
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:38,172
If you ask me it looks more like your own little jungle.

32
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,634
Is that a bay leaf?

33
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:46,514
Where did you get that?

34
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,184
I wanted to wait and give it to you on your birthday, but...

35
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:51,894
Happy birthday!

36
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:58,943
This will last me all year.

37
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,405
But the bay tree is so far away.

38
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,866
If a bean saw you it would...

39
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,200
Beans don't scare me.

40
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:07,609
The beans should scare you.

41
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,944
That's what worries me.

42
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,955
The world is a dangerous place for a Borrower.

43
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,833
Your Aunt Eggletina wasn't scared either and she...

44
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:15,325
Was eaten by a toad.

45
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:16,744
I know, I know.

46
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,589
If you don't like your gift I can put it in my room.

47
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:21,466
No, no, I should keep it.

48
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,552
I have just the recipe for these.

49
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,429
I'll have your father borrow some sugar.

50
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,765
Oh, you don't have to.

51
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,601
Because tonight I'll borrow some for you.

52
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:32,977
What?

53
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,480
Don't tell me you forgot!

54
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,690
Tonight's my first borrowing!

55
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:39,942
Look, Papa's home.

56
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:42,727
Papa.

57
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:43,770
Papa, I made it all the way to the bay tree today.

58
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,908
And I used the leaves over my head just like you said.

59
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:49,452
And I didn't even get seen by the cat.

60
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:51,548
So, what I'm trying to say, - if there was any doubt...

61
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:53,571
- There's a new bean in the house.

62
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,791
What?

63
00:06:54,884 --> 00:06:55,726
- I know.

64
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:56,588
I saw him.

65
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:57,450
- Arrietty, I told you to be...

66
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,587
Yes, Mama, I was careful and he didn't see me.

67
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,798
And he's much smaller than other beans.

68
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:04,759
Papa, you just have to let me come borrowing tonight.

69
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,720
We know nothing about this new bean.

70
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:09,972
But you promised this would be my night.

71
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:11,140
And I've seen him.

72
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,935
Papa, please, I am telling you, he's just a child.

73
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,188
And the children are more vicious than the grownups.

74
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,357
I'll be fine.

75
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,321
Well, the young beans do go to bed early.

76
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,865
Oh, thank you, Papa!

77
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:29,700
Pod!

78
00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:31,213
The boy is very sickly and weak.

79
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,652
She'll be fine.

80
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:33,788
But...

81
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,574
Oh, and don't worry, Mother.

82
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:39,201
I'll get Papa back safely.

83
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,882
Arrietty will be turning 14 soon.

84
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:47,593
She'll need to know how to take care of herself out there.

85
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:49,136
Without our help.

86
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,224
Sometimes I worry that we are the only Borrowers left.

87
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,644
What'll become of us?

88
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,452
Remember what the doctor said, Shawn.

89
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:14,756
Your heart needs rest.

90
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:15,986
No excitement.

91
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,447
- Is that clear, Hara?

92
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:18,824
- Yes, ma'am, I'll see to it.

93
00:08:18,926 --> 00:08:21,325
Whatever you need, Shawn, you ask Hara, - and she'll get it for you, all right?

94
00:08:21,345 --> 00:08:23,744
- Yes, Aunt Jessica.

95
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,506
Make him feel at home, Hara.

96
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,966
Yes, ma'am.

97
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:38,019
We'll start by keeping the bugs out.

98
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:26,400
Don't you think you should wear something a little darker and longer?

99
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,694
No, I think this one's perfect.

100
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:34,575
So, I need you to get me some tissue paper and some sugar.

101
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:39,288
Oh, and promise, dear husband, you won't let our daughter get eaten or squashed like a bug.

102
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:40,655
Oh, please God.

103
00:09:40,675 --> 00:09:41,948
Please help them.

104
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:45,159
Don't worry about me.

105
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:45,910
Everything's fine.

106
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:49,663
Okay, bye, Mom.

107
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:50,413
I love you.

108
00:09:50,518 --> 00:09:51,263
Oh, goodbye.

109
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:52,028
Love you, too.

110
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:52,793
Stay close to your father.

111
00:09:52,885 --> 00:10:01,936
I will Do I get one of those?

112
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:03,532
Nope?

113
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:04,346
Okay.

114
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,919
Arrietty!

115
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:46,814
Did you see that?

116
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,232
That's my girl.

117
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:56,240
Don't look down.

118
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,994
One step at a time.

119
00:11:27,114 --> 00:11:28,137
All right.

120
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:29,180
You need to hold this for me.

121
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,608
Okay.

122
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:05,976
Arrietty, make sure you hold on tight.

123
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,023
Arrietty!

124
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:54,348
- Let's go.

125
00:12:54,368 --> 00:12:55,474
- Right.

126
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,734
It's so big.

127
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:22,112
Papa, what is this place?

128
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:25,241
This is where beans store all their food.

129
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:26,784
The sugar is over there.

130
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,124
When you get down there, wait for me.

131
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,599
Yeah!

132
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,839
Papa, you are great!

133
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,461
Yay!

134
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:47,435
There.

135
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:48,457
That wasn't so hard.

136
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,750
- Where to now?

137
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,960
- Tissue paper.

138
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,170
Then home.

139
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,863
Papa, look what I found.

140
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,700
Looks like someone got their first borrowing.

141
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:16,412
Careful with it, it's sharp.

142
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:17,621
Okay.

143
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,311
Papa, borrowing is so much fun!

144
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,569
Look down there.

145
00:17:54,168 --> 00:17:55,920
Filthy rats.

146
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,692
You want to stay away from those things.

147
00:17:58,454 --> 00:17:59,538
I'm not afraid.

148
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,209
I will cut them down to size with my sword.

149
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:08,172
Sometimes it's best not to go looking for danger.

150
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,386
What is this place?

151
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,140
I've heard human beans call it a dollhouse.

152
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,268
Dolls are toys for beans.

153
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,562
And we are not toys.

154
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,023
These things are not for borrowing.

155
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,817
Oh, but it's so perfect for us.

156
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:15,239
Don't you think Mother would absolutely love that dresser over there?

157
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:18,158
If anything went missing, they'd know right away.

158
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,452
Borrowers take only what they need.

159
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,763
Don't be afraid, okay?

160
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,617
Hey.

161
00:22:07,045 --> 00:22:08,672
I know it was you in the garden.

162
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:10,319
I knew I saw you.

163
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:23,760
My mother used to tell me stories about the little people who lived under the floors.

164
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,764
Was it you?

165
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,599
Was it?

166
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,853
Please don't go.

167
00:23:19,576 --> 00:23:20,578
I'm sorry.

168
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:21,600
I should have told you.

169
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,029
He might have seen me out in the garden today.

170
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,574
We all make mistakes.

171
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,786
So we'll just have to be extra careful now.

172
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,914
Best not to tell your mother about this.

173
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,832
You know how she worries.

174
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,542
Right.

175
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,758
I'm very proud of you.

176
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:48,303
A lesser Borrower would've panicked and run away.

177
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:03,735
Well, we're home.

178
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:05,862
Safe and sound.

179
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,750
Is everything okay?

180
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,337
Not quite the adventure we'd hoped for.

181
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,423
This old light gave out halfway to the kitchen.

182
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,926
No.

183
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:31,346
Well, I'm afraid we had to give up on the sugar.

184
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:33,567
That's okay.

185
00:24:33,587 --> 00:24:35,423
I'm just happy you made it home.

186
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:37,477
It wasn't a total loss.

187
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:40,814
Arrietty, why don't you show your mother your first borrowing?

188
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,741
What a beautiful pin.

189
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,069
Okay.

190
00:24:56,089 --> 00:24:56,778
Off to bed.

191
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,589
Night, Mama, Papa.

192
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,846
She looks so worn-out.

193
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,765
Should I make us some tea?

194
00:27:48,803 --> 00:27:50,994
Shawn, come inside.

195
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:53,205
You'll catch your death of cold.

196
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,854
What did you say?

197
00:28:38,874 --> 00:28:40,209
Why would he do that?

198
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:42,722
I think he was just being nice.

199
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:46,351
It's the same cube of sugar I dropped in his room last night.

200
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:51,981
Pod, what does she mean, she dropped it?

201
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,894
Do not touch it.

202
00:28:57,914 --> 00:28:59,104
Do you understand me?

203
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:04,160
It's a trap.

204
00:29:04,671 --> 00:29:06,090
I just know it.

205
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,529
They're going to trap us like cockroaches.

206
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:11,251
Homily, let's try not to get hysterical, okay?

207
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,337
Don't tell me to not get hysterical!

208
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,256
We'll probably have to move now.

209
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,843
Goodbye, old table.

210
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,887
We had so many fun times together.

211
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,101
Let's not say goodbye to anything just yet.

212
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,478
Eat your soup before it gets cold.

213
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:34,649
I told you that young bean would be trouble!

214
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,197
But no one ever listens to me.

215
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:58,298
Thank you, Arrietty.

216
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:01,134
Smart girl, doing this when the sun came out.

217
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:05,096
Or maybe I have a smart mama who taught me.

218
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:09,851
You're a good girl.

219
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:12,604
If you've got this, I think I'll go lie down a bit.

220
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:13,897
Okay.

221
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,111
Is that you from last night?

222
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:16,105
No, wait.

223
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:16,981
Don't go.

224
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:21,787
I'm sorry if I frightened you.

225
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:23,080
Please leave us alone.

226
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,167
We don't need your help.

227
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:29,086
But can I please just talk to you?

228
00:35:30,056 --> 00:35:31,433
No!

229
00:35:31,453 --> 00:35:32,830
Human beans are dangerous.

230
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:34,394
Whenever we're seen, we have to move.

231
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:35,874
My parents said so.

232
00:35:37,104 --> 00:35:38,606
So you have a family.

233
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:40,128
That must be nice.

234
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:43,267
You don't have a family?

235
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,603
Yeah, I have one.

236
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:48,314
But they sent me here to get the care and attention I need.

237
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:51,525
Because they're both very busy with their work.

238
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:54,195
Sorry to hear that.

239
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,107
Anyway, my name is Shawn.

240
00:35:59,127 --> 00:36:00,609
What's your name?

241
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:05,414
What do they call you?

242
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:10,378
Not that it's any of your business, but it's Arrietty.

243
00:36:11,472 --> 00:36:12,974
Arrietty.

244
00:36:12,994 --> 00:36:14,496
Arrietty.

245
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,510
That's a beautiful name.

246
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:21,847
Maybe we could be friends?

247
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,903
Could you at least come out so I can see you?

248
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:37,405
I want to make sure I'm not dreaming.

249
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,914
I won't hurt you, I promise.

250
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:01,981
Help me!

251
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:02,502
Help me!

252
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:36,162
Hey!

253
00:37:36,182 --> 00:37:36,663
Hey!

254
00:37:36,683 --> 00:37:37,164
Hey!

255
00:37:38,434 --> 00:37:40,124
What in the world?

256
00:37:40,144 --> 00:37:41,834
A crow!

257
00:37:44,523 --> 00:37:45,226
Oh!

258
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:45,949
Attack!

259
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:46,672
OW!

260
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:51,979
You get out right now!

261
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,534
What got into that bird?

262
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:08,329
Don't think I've ever seen one behave like that.

263
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:11,207
Maybe it's nesting season or something.

264
00:38:11,425 --> 00:38:12,990
I don't know.

265
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,575
Looks me to like it was after something.

266
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:17,380
Oh, look at the holes in the screen.

267
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:19,882
Which I'll have to replace, of course.

268
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:21,520
Oh, my goodness.

269
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,501
Are you all right?

270
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:25,388
Your aunt said for you not to get too excited!

271
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:26,597
Should I get your medicine?

272
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:29,027
No, that's okay, Miss Hara.

273
00:38:29,047 --> 00:38:30,841
I'm actually feeling pretty good.

274
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:40,277
Nesting season?

275
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:51,914
Well, Shawn, you have a nice, long rest now.

276
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:52,641
Papa!

277
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:57,313
I hear you visited the young bean.

278
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:58,814
I'm sorry.

279
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:01,650
I went to ask him to leave us alone.

280
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,487
But I really don't think he intends to hurt us.

281
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:08,699
Many Borrowers have lost their lives thinking the same.

282
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,077
It must never happen again.

283
00:40:12,171 --> 00:40:13,152
- Do you understand me?

284
00:40:13,172 --> 00:40:14,153
- Yeah.

285
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:26,091
We'd better start looking for a new home.

286
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,514
The boy knows that we're here.

287
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:36,936
Are we safe?

288
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:11,898
Delivery.

289
00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:12,878
Package for you, ma'am.

290
00:41:15,693 --> 00:41:17,049
Thanks for the drink, Hara.

291
00:41:17,069 --> 00:41:18,425
It's pretty hot today.

292
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:22,606
Do you happen to know of any good pest control companies?

293
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,650
Pest problem?

294
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:30,656
Here's one. "Squeaky Klean Pest Extermination."

295
00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:32,293
1-800...

296
00:41:32,313 --> 00:41:33,857
Oh, hang on.

297
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:40,833
So you got yourself a mouse problem?

298
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:44,420
Maybe it's mice, maybe it's little tiny people.

299
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:51,343
Strange things have been happening here and I know why.

300
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:54,346
That's just the craziest thing I've ever heard.

301
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,683
I mean, when Hara told me, I just couldn't believe it.

302
00:41:57,766 --> 00:42:00,728
Why on earth would a crow try to fly into your room?

303
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,564
Were you frightened?

304
00:42:03,657 --> 00:42:06,765
No, I wasn't scared.

305
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:09,893
Hara came and chased it away And it's a good thing I came in when I did.

306
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:12,865
That bird had huge wings and claws...

307
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:20,456
Let's not relive the excitement, Hara, considering Shawn came here for a little peace and quiet and tranquility before his operation.

308
00:42:21,342 --> 00:42:22,510
Yes, ma'am.

309
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,698
Forgive me.

310
00:42:26,555 --> 00:42:28,621
I'm sorry, Hara.

311
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:30,707
I don't mean to be short with you.

312
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:35,137
But why his mother chose this time to go away on business is just beyond...

313
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:40,225
It must be terribly hard for you without your mother here to look after you.

314
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:42,603
You know, not so much lately.

315
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:48,233
I suppose the divorce couldn't be helped, but honestly, why couldn't she be here when her son needs her so?

316
00:42:48,317 --> 00:42:50,903
It's the last thing his poor heart needs.

317
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,581
Aunt Jessica, I was noticing that miniature house in my room.

318
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:04,166
And the detail's amazing.

319
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,418
Oh, you mean the dollhouse.

320
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:09,588
That beautiful little house belonged to your mother.

321
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:13,258
She had to leave it here when she moved away to go to college.

322
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:14,510
It was Mother's?

323
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:21,517
Your grandfather had it specially made because he was hoping it would be a lovely home for the little people.

324
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:22,893
What?

325
00:43:22,986 --> 00:43:24,656
That's right.

326
00:43:24,676 --> 00:43:26,346
Little people who lived in the walls.

327
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,107
He was quite obsessed with them.

328
00:43:28,816 --> 00:43:31,193
People laughed, of course, and called him mad.

329
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,612
But your mother, she believed him.

330
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:37,533
They worked on that house together for hours.

331
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:41,703
And he told her they would come, but of course, they never did.

332
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:46,959
Tell me, Shawn, have you ever seen any tiny little people in your room?

333
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,381
Can't say that I have.

334
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:56,969
I think it's why your mother doesn't like to come here any more.

335
00:43:57,052 --> 00:44:00,889
Too many memories of wishes that never came true.

336
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:02,766
Can we look inside it?

337
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:04,226
Yes!

338
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:09,231
You know, I haven't looked inside it in quite a long time.

339
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,321
Hara, could you be a dear and turn off the lights?

340
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:17,739
Ma'am.

341
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:31,128
So many years have passed This is the living room.

342
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:36,216
Your grandfather had all of this handmade by a real furniture maker in England.

343
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:39,553
Isn't that just insane?

344
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:42,806
Look at the attention to detail.

345
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,267
They really were preparing it for someone to live in.

346
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:53,317
And just in case you don't believe what I'm saying is absolutely true, have a look at that room right there.

347
00:44:58,238 --> 00:45:02,618
Come in the garden What a kitchen!

348
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:06,705
And look at the trees Everything in it a miniature of the real thing.

349
00:45:06,798 --> 00:45:08,551
That oven actually works.

350
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:10,324
You could bake real cookies.

351
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:12,794
Some really little cookies.

352
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:15,547
What a pity their dream never came true.

353
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:20,385
It really would've made a lovely home.

354
00:45:21,929 --> 00:47:45,447
Settled down there long ago So many years have passed The dew is still on the roses I left my childhood In a garden green Come in the garden And sit on the grass I used to sit there when I was a child Ivy and moss Little daisies Covered the lane long ago You know, Mother, we've had these same pictures for years.

355
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:46,740
Wouldn't you like some new ones?

356
00:47:47,074 --> 00:47:49,868
Well, Arrietty, I like those pictures.

357
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:53,747
And I've always dreamed I'd see the real ocean someday.

358
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:57,751
Besides, there's no point in changing them now.

359
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:04,883
I wonder what's taking Papa so long.

360
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:08,220
Why is my first thought always that he got eaten by the cat?

361
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:09,471
What's wrong with me?

362
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:14,059
There he is!

363
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:15,811
Does he look eaten?

364
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,357
Hey, Papa, how was it out there?

365
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,487
I slipped and twisted my leg.

366
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,614
I'm lucky that Spiller here found me.

367
00:48:33,704 --> 00:48:35,122
Well, what is going on down...

368
00:48:35,205 --> 00:48:37,249
Pod, you're hurt!

369
00:48:37,342 --> 00:48:38,532
It was the cat, wasn't it?

370
00:48:38,552 --> 00:48:39,742
See, I'm not crazy.

371
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:41,002
Get up here!

372
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,422
Does it hurt, Papa?

373
00:48:43,515 --> 00:48:45,017
It's just a sprain.

374
00:48:45,037 --> 00:48:46,539
Go calm your mother.

375
00:48:47,728 --> 00:48:48,646
I'll get some cold water.

376
00:48:48,666 --> 00:48:49,584
I'll be right back.

377
00:48:49,678 --> 00:48:51,304
Everyone relax!

378
00:48:52,524 --> 00:48:53,464
Here's a towel.

379
00:48:53,484 --> 00:48:54,424
Dry yourself.

380
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:56,852
Who's that?

381
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:05,193
I wonder if he has news about any of the other Borrowers.

382
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:15,036
Okay, I leave now.

383
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,206
Can't you at least stay and have some tea?

384
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:27,966
Arrietty, I'll take care of your father.

385
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,927
Why don't you see if Spiller would like a cup of tea?

386
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,983
Won't you please stay, Spiller?

387
00:49:34,003 --> 00:49:35,756
I've never met another Borrower before.

388
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:41,897
We can't thank you enough for your help.

389
00:49:42,606 --> 00:49:44,983
Tell us, have you seen other Borrowers?

390
00:49:45,076 --> 00:49:47,142
We're all alone here and we're starting to believe we're the only ones left.

391
00:49:47,162 --> 00:49:49,228
Are we?

392
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:53,992
This many.

393
00:49:54,085 --> 00:49:55,734
Oh!

394
00:49:55,754 --> 00:49:57,403
Then cousin Lupy could still be alive.

395
00:49:59,216 --> 00:50:00,259
Oh, that's a bow, isn't it?

396
00:50:00,279 --> 00:50:01,322
Can I see it?

397
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:09,591
You use this for your borrowing?

398
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:17,933
Give that back, Arrietty, before you shoot someone's eye out.

399
00:50:32,374 --> 00:50:33,293
Okay.

400
00:50:33,313 --> 00:50:34,232
Go now.

401
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:38,286
Oh, but couldn't you stay a little bit longer?

402
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:39,913
I'll cook dinner.

403
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:43,792
Already got this.

404
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,922
A cricket leg!

405
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:51,842
Want some?

406
00:50:51,935 --> 00:50:52,895
- Very fresh.

407
00:50:52,915 --> 00:50:53,875
- No, thanks.

408
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:00,058
Bye.

409
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:02,811
Thank you, my friend.

410
00:51:06,157 --> 00:51:07,159
I'll go with him.

411
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:08,181
To see him out.

412
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:17,242
What were you doing out there in that storm?

413
00:51:17,868 --> 00:51:20,287
I was looking for a safe route for our journey.

414
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,372
And now I know which route not to take.

415
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:23,832
Oh, Pod.

416
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:27,669
Spiller knows of more Borrowers a few days journey away.

417
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:30,755
There's a small river past the forest.

418
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:32,507
He's offered to take us on it.

419
00:51:33,008 --> 00:51:34,843
That's great.

420
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:39,514
I'm sure we'll find a new place in no time.

421
00:51:40,432 --> 00:51:44,144
And I'm sure it will almost be as nice as this.

422
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:50,233
I'm really glad I met you, Spiller.

423
00:51:50,317 --> 00:51:51,651
Or that I met anyone.

424
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:54,696
Hey, maybe next time you could bring your whole family with you.

425
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:56,688
No family.

426
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:58,023
Only Spiller.

427
00:52:00,045 --> 00:52:00,900
Well, we...

428
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,775
We could be a family.

429
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,414
And when you come back you could stay for a family dinner.

430
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:11,231
Hara?

431
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:32,919
Arrietty, your stitches need to be closer together.

432
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:34,462
You'll have to start over.

433
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:38,633
Why do we need such a big bag anyway?

434
00:53:38,717 --> 00:53:40,719
Are we putting the whole house in here?

435
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:51,104
I think I'm gonna go check on Papa.

436
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:55,608
Papa, can I come in?

437
00:53:57,871 --> 00:53:59,415
- How's your leg?

438
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:00,979
- Well, better than that cricket's.

439
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:02,407
I'm serious.

440
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:07,787
Papa, why do we have to move?

441
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:12,584
Once a Borrower has been seen, the beans' curiosity can't be stopped.

442
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:20,008
Well, isn't it possible that not every human bean is dangerous?

443
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:27,807
Arrietty, before you were born there were two other families who were living in this house.

444
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:31,311
One family went missing, they just disappeared.

445
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:33,605
The other one moved away.

446
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:35,398
They were seen by humans.

447
00:54:35,482 --> 00:54:39,527
And so, we have to do whatever it takes to survive.

448
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:41,946
But, Papa...

449
00:54:50,298 --> 00:54:50,883
Oh!

450
00:54:50,903 --> 00:54:51,488
Oh, no!

451
00:54:57,722 --> 00:54:59,558
Pod, what is it?

452
00:54:59,578 --> 00:55:01,414
An earthquake?

453
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:27,325
Mother!

454
00:55:29,202 --> 00:55:31,955
It won't open!

455
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:37,043
Frame is buckled!

456
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:00,650
The wall!

457
00:56:36,895 --> 00:56:38,188
Homily!

458
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:41,357
Homily, are you all right?

459
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:46,654
Pod, remember how I always said I wanted a new kitchen?

460
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,053
More bills.

461
00:57:52,095 --> 00:57:54,389
Remember, take only the things we need.

462
00:58:02,063 --> 00:58:04,232
We can't possibly carry all of this.

463
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:08,903
And, Homily, don't take anything from the dollhouse.

464
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:13,032
I'm gonna go make sure that it's safe.

465
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:15,045
- You stay with your mother.

466
00:58:15,065 --> 00:58:16,359
- Okay.

467
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:50,069
So you finally came.

468
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:02,832
Did you like your new kitchen?

469
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:07,003
Well, our house looks like a train wreck.

470
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,663
But it doesn't matter.

471
00:59:10,683 --> 00:59:12,206
Because I came to tell you goodbye.

472
00:59:17,305 --> 00:59:18,973
Can I turn around?

473
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,749
You're beautiful.

474
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:49,754
My papa said we have to move now.

475
00:59:52,215 --> 00:59:56,386
We've been seen, and Borrowers aren't supposed to be seen.

476
00:59:56,928 --> 00:59:58,429
What are Borrowers?

477
00:59:58,513 --> 01:00:00,932
My mother, father, and I are all Borrowers.

478
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:03,393
We borrow things that beans won't miss if they are gone.

479
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:06,938
Just little things, soap, cookies, and sugar.

480
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:09,107
All things that we need to survive.

481
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:11,275
Even my great-grandfather was a Borrower.

482
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:14,779
I think my grandfather saw one of you once.

483
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:16,906
It's possible.

484
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:21,869
And it's my fault that you're leaving.

485
01:00:22,213 --> 01:00:23,278
Niya!

486
01:00:23,298 --> 01:00:24,363
Niya!

487
01:00:24,465 --> 01:00:25,800
Don't be like that.

488
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,155
Be nice to her.

489
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:32,338
So, in my aunt's house, how many other Borrowers are there who are living with you?

490
01:00:33,256 --> 01:00:36,634
It's just my father and my mother and me.

491
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:38,719
What about in other houses?

492
01:00:38,803 --> 01:00:40,221
I'm sure there are some.

493
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:42,974
But I've only met one other so far.

494
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:49,313
You must be afraid you'll be the only ones of your kind who are left.

495
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:50,731
What?

496
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,401
Every year there's fewer and fewer of you, right?

497
01:00:53,985 --> 01:00:57,280
Aren't you scared that soon you'll all be gone?

498
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,117
What a horrible thing to say!

499
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,662
I know that there's more of us because Spiller said so!

500
01:01:05,288 --> 01:01:06,664
Who's Spiller?

501
01:01:06,757 --> 01:01:09,803
He's one of us.

502
01:01:09,823 --> 01:01:12,869
He lives out in the forest, and he said that there are hundreds more of us.

503
01:01:13,546 --> 01:01:14,964
That might be true.

504
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:17,842
But, you know, none of us can live forever, can we?

505
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:22,430
We all have to die sometime.

506
01:01:23,097 --> 01:01:25,057
Why would you say something like that?

507
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:27,602
Because it's true.

508
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:29,729
I guess so.

509
01:01:30,188 --> 01:01:32,773
Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.

510
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:37,278
Sometimes things happen to us that are just beyond our control.

511
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:43,075
And when these things happen, there's really nothing you can do about it.

512
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,496
You just accept it and prepare for the worst.

513
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:49,749
I wish it wasn't that way.

514
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:53,127
But you can't live a life that's built on nothing but wishes.

515
01:01:54,295 --> 01:01:56,297
It isn't practical.

516
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,300
Sometimes you just have to accept the hand of fate.

517
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:01,969
Oh, no, you don't.

518
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:07,475
Sometimes you have to stand up and fight for the things that are worth fighting for.

519
01:02:08,611 --> 01:02:10,071
You have to survive.

520
01:02:10,091 --> 01:02:11,551
That's what my papa says.

521
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:14,649
And so we're leaving even though it's dangerous.

522
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:17,568
And we are going to survive.

523
01:02:17,662 --> 01:02:19,331
We are Borrowers and we'll make do.

524
01:02:19,351 --> 01:02:21,020
We always have.

525
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:24,492
As long as we have each other to live for, we'll keep on living.

526
01:02:27,004 --> 01:02:28,569
I'm sorry.

527
01:02:28,589 --> 01:02:30,154
I didn't mean to upset you.

528
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:33,626
I'm actually the one who's going to die.

529
01:02:34,126 --> 01:02:35,503
What?

530
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:40,550
There's something wrong with my heart.

531
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:44,762
They're gonna operate next week but it probably won't help.

532
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:46,264
That's terrible.

533
01:02:48,641 --> 01:02:51,811
I've always been sick and I've had someone looking after me.

534
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:57,525
And that's why when I saw you, I just wanted to find a way to protect you.

535
01:02:57,608 --> 01:03:00,236
But I guess I messed up.

536
01:03:00,329 --> 01:03:01,456
I made it worse.

537
01:03:01,476 --> 01:03:02,603
I'm sorry.

538
01:03:04,532 --> 01:03:07,159
And I'm sorry to hear about your heart.

539
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:33,936
Now what on earth is this doing here?

540
01:04:00,046 --> 01:04:03,924
Now how did you get in there?

541
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:22,526
There you are!

542
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,030
Mom!

543
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:28,543
What?

544
01:04:28,563 --> 01:04:29,648
What's wrong?

545
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:32,828
My mother, I think she's in danger.

546
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:45,424
No!

547
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,975
Give me that, you little thief!

548
01:05:04,193 --> 01:05:07,154
Now we'll see who they call crazy.

549
01:05:07,988 --> 01:05:11,826
And I bet there's more of you, aren't there?

550
01:05:13,587 --> 01:05:14,387
Wait, no!

551
01:05:14,407 --> 01:05:15,207
Wait, wait!

552
01:05:15,227 --> 01:05:16,027
Wait!

553
01:05:33,514 --> 01:05:34,640
I have to go help her.

554
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:37,184
But...

555
01:06:00,718 --> 01:06:01,532
Oh, no!

556
01:06:01,552 --> 01:06:02,366
Help!

557
01:06:02,386 --> 01:06:03,200
No, no, please!

558
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:04,034
Help!

559
01:06:04,138 --> 01:06:05,098
Pod!

560
01:06:05,118 --> 01:06:06,078
Arrietty!

561
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:11,385
Let me out of here!

562
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:21,176
Hey!

563
01:06:21,196 --> 01:06:22,051
Hey!

564
01:06:24,033 --> 01:06:24,639
Hey!

565
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:25,265
Hey!

566
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:25,891
Let me out of here!

567
01:06:26,202 --> 01:06:27,329
Arrietty!

568
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:28,476
Help!

569
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:33,866
Watch it!

570
01:06:48,923 --> 01:06:50,591
Let's see.

571
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,933
Now to find the others.

572
01:06:59,527 --> 01:07:00,272
Let me out!

573
01:07:00,292 --> 01:07:01,037
No!

574
01:07:01,057 --> 01:07:01,802
No!

575
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:35,970
Something terrible has happened.

576
01:09:01,273 --> 01:09:02,421
- Squeaky Klean.

577
01:09:02,441 --> 01:09:03,589
- Yes, hello.

578
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:06,101
I'm calling from 833 Elm Lane.

579
01:09:06,185 --> 01:09:08,103
Could you get out here right away?

580
01:09:08,395 --> 01:09:11,440
I have a very unique pest problem.

581
01:09:11,533 --> 01:09:13,057
- Is it mice?

582
01:09:13,077 --> 01:09:14,601
- Oh, much worse than mice.

583
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:17,154
Do you want them exterminated?

584
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:19,949
No, I need you to trap them.

585
01:09:31,095 --> 01:09:31,687
Shawn!

586
01:09:31,707 --> 01:09:32,299
Shawn!

587
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:32,911
Shawn!

588
01:09:33,597 --> 01:09:34,954
Shawn!

589
01:09:34,974 --> 01:09:36,331
Shawn!

590
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:37,675
Arrietty!

591
01:09:43,472 --> 01:09:45,015
My mother is missing.

592
01:09:45,484 --> 01:09:47,279
Someone took the roof off!

593
01:09:47,299 --> 01:09:49,094
I think a human bean got her.

594
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:56,527
Oh, Mama.

595
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:08,914
We will find her.

596
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:42,823
What?

597
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:45,868
Someone's locked us in.

598
01:10:50,257 --> 01:10:51,300
There's a room next door.

599
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,363
Hold on tight.

600
01:10:59,131 --> 01:11:00,758
One step at a time.

601
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:01,967
Right.

602
01:11:11,602 --> 01:11:12,728
It's stuck!

603
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,271
Wait.

604
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:25,616
I can get us in.

605
01:11:49,807 --> 01:11:51,391
Oh, no, no!

606
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,194
Keep going.

607
01:12:37,813 --> 01:12:40,065
What do you mean you're lost?

608
01:12:40,649 --> 01:12:43,026
How can you possibly be lost?

609
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:44,653
It's the only road!

610
01:12:44,746 --> 01:12:45,908
- Is it before the bridge?

611
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:47,090
- What bridge?

612
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:48,272
There's no bridge!

613
01:12:55,998 --> 01:12:57,791
Hara must have found it and opened it.

614
01:12:57,875 --> 01:12:59,459
This is what I was afraid of.

615
01:12:59,543 --> 01:13:01,128
Mother's been taken.

616
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:39,541
Are you okay?

617
01:13:40,135 --> 01:13:41,200
Be careful.

618
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,285
Shawn, please.

619
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:52,179
Where are those idiots?

620
01:14:26,348 --> 01:14:27,683
Mother!

621
01:14:27,703 --> 01:14:29,038
Where are you?

622
01:14:29,935 --> 01:14:31,584
Be wise.

623
01:14:31,604 --> 01:14:33,253
They're supposed to catch pests.

624
01:14:45,075 --> 01:14:46,181
But...

625
01:14:46,201 --> 01:14:47,307
HOW did you...

626
01:14:47,401 --> 01:14:48,694
Hara.

627
01:14:51,113 --> 01:14:53,282
Could I have some warm milk?

628
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:54,543
Okay!

629
01:14:54,563 --> 01:14:55,731
Wait just a minute.

630
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:07,296
Thank you, Hara.

631
01:15:45,344 --> 01:15:46,659
I'm a little hungry.

632
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:47,994
Are there any cookies?

633
01:15:48,096 --> 01:15:49,536
Cookies?

634
01:15:49,556 --> 01:15:50,996
Now he wants cookies.

635
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:56,094
Mother!

636
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,097
Mother!

637
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:08,065
Mother!

638
01:16:08,148 --> 01:16:09,399
Arrietty!

639
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:14,654
Over here!

640
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,217
Arrietty!

641
01:16:17,237 --> 01:16:17,954
Here I am!

642
01:16:17,974 --> 01:16:18,691
Here I am!

643
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:20,535
Oh, Mother!

644
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:25,374
Oh, Arrietty.

645
01:16:52,661 --> 01:16:53,704
Oh, good.

646
01:16:53,724 --> 01:16:54,767
There they are.

647
01:16:54,871 --> 01:16:56,269
They finally found the road.

648
01:16:56,289 --> 01:16:57,687
The only road.

649
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:20,595
Another bean!

650
01:17:24,609 --> 01:17:25,381
It's okay, Mother.

651
01:17:25,401 --> 01:17:26,173
He's a friend.

652
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:51,418
Ma'am, we'd like to take a look around.

653
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:52,669
See what we see.

654
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:54,254
Yes, of course.

655
01:18:18,445 --> 01:18:21,448
Squeaky Klean Exterminators?

656
01:18:21,791 --> 01:18:22,772
Hara?

657
01:18:22,792 --> 01:18:23,773
Hara!

658
01:18:24,618 --> 01:18:25,660
Oh!

659
01:18:26,912 --> 01:18:28,663
What's going on here?

660
01:18:28,747 --> 01:18:30,665
It's finally happened.

661
01:18:30,749 --> 01:18:32,709
I found the little people.

662
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:34,211
Little people?

663
01:18:35,347 --> 01:18:37,037
Yes!

664
01:18:37,057 --> 01:18:38,747
And what little robbers they are.

665
01:18:51,071 --> 01:18:53,470
I wouldn't have believed it either unless I'd seen it with my own eyes.

666
01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:55,889
It's remarkable!

667
01:18:55,982 --> 01:18:58,777
It's the eighth wonder of the world.

668
01:18:59,486 --> 01:19:02,113
And they're so teeny!

669
01:19:02,197 --> 01:19:05,492
And they have a whole house full of things they've stolen.

670
01:19:05,951 --> 01:19:08,036
Are you sure you didn't find the sherry again?

671
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:11,581
All these years you thought I was losing things.

672
01:19:11,675 --> 01:19:12,906
But it wasn't me.

673
01:19:12,926 --> 01:19:14,157
It was them!

674
01:19:14,251 --> 01:19:17,462
You didn't mention little people to the exterminators, did you?

675
01:19:17,556 --> 01:19:18,578
No.

676
01:19:18,598 --> 01:19:19,620
I didn't want to scare them off.

677
01:19:19,714 --> 01:19:22,175
Because I'm sure the house is just full of them.

678
01:19:23,969 --> 01:19:26,263
You'll see when I show you.

679
01:19:26,638 --> 01:19:29,015
This is their nest.

680
01:19:30,892 --> 01:19:33,520
Nest?

681
01:19:38,066 --> 01:19:40,902
Looks like a pile of old junk to me.

682
01:19:40,986 --> 01:19:42,862
What?

683
01:19:43,582 --> 01:19:44,709
It was here!

684
01:19:44,729 --> 01:19:45,856
It was here!

685
01:19:47,534 --> 01:19:48,952
Where's that little teapot?

686
01:19:49,035 --> 01:19:51,955
Okay, Hara, I'm sending the exterminators away.

687
01:19:52,048 --> 01:19:52,779
No!

688
01:19:52,799 --> 01:19:53,530
No, no!

689
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:54,281
Wait just a minute.

690
01:19:55,051 --> 01:19:55,921
Oh.

691
01:19:55,941 --> 01:19:56,811
Oh!

692
01:19:56,831 --> 01:19:57,701
I'll clean that up later.

693
01:19:59,921 --> 01:20:02,173
Oh, please!

694
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,044
Hello, Shawn.

695
01:20:07,064 --> 01:20:08,588
Can we come in for a minute?

696
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,723
It's open.

697
01:20:20,619 --> 01:20:22,538
You'll see.

698
01:20:22,558 --> 01:20:24,477
Those little thieves stole the tiny kitchen.

699
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:29,868
I don't know how they did it, but the whole thing is gone.

700
01:20:32,746 --> 01:20:33,913
Not gone.

701
01:20:33,997 --> 01:20:36,333
Perhaps you need a little time off, Hara.

702
01:20:37,959 --> 01:20:40,503
Yeah.

703
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:49,669
Wait!

704
01:20:49,689 --> 01:20:50,628
Wait!

705
01:20:50,648 --> 01:20:51,587
I can prove it!

706
01:20:51,681 --> 01:20:53,808
I've got one of them in a jar!

707
01:20:56,404 --> 01:20:58,324
Poor Hara.

708
01:20:58,344 --> 01:21:00,264
I think she's finally gone bonkers.

709
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:05,862
Do I smell fresh herbs?

710
01:21:18,917 --> 01:21:22,504
Someone's been making tea.

711
01:21:24,464 --> 01:21:26,466
It's just as my father told us.

712
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:28,843
There really are little people living here.

713
01:21:32,138 --> 01:21:33,348
Yes, there are.

714
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,559
Your mother really should be here to see this.

715
01:21:36,643 --> 01:21:39,562
She waited so long for some proof of them.

716
01:21:39,646 --> 01:21:41,731
But they're not thieves like Hara said.

717
01:21:41,815 --> 01:21:43,066
They're just Borrowers.

718
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:44,401
What?

719
01:21:45,026 --> 01:21:47,737
I mean, they must be very frightened.

720
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:52,367
I just hope they're still here.

721
01:21:57,372 --> 01:21:58,707
I hope so, too.

722
01:22:13,481 --> 01:22:14,400
Excuse me.

723
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:15,339
Ma'am!

724
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:18,059
Where would you like us to start looking?

725
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:28,486
Oh, are you all right?

726
01:22:31,072 --> 01:22:33,074
Where did she go?

727
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:36,035
Who took my lady?

728
01:22:36,337 --> 01:22:37,589
There are little people!

729
01:22:37,609 --> 01:22:38,861
There are!

730
01:22:38,955 --> 01:22:43,293
Easy, 68$)' And, no, I'm not losing my mind!

731
01:22:58,475 --> 01:23:01,186
If I collapse, leave me behind.

732
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:02,937
With my tea kettle.

733
01:23:03,364 --> 01:23:05,284
You're doing great.

734
01:23:05,304 --> 01:23:07,224
It's just a little further until we break for food.

735
01:23:08,318 --> 01:23:09,986
Can't we just head back?

736
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:13,156
We can live with the rats in the compost heap.

737
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:16,159
Oh, no!

738
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:29,923
Let's hurry.

739
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:32,675
I can't do it.

740
01:23:59,077 --> 01:24:01,246
Arrietty, you really should eat something.

741
01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:03,873
We're gonna be walking at least until morning.

742
01:24:03,957 --> 01:24:05,124
What?

743
01:24:07,168 --> 01:24:08,753
I'm so sorry.

744
01:24:09,838 --> 01:24:14,926
I feel like maybe it's all my fault that we had to leave such a wonderful house.

745
01:24:18,513 --> 01:24:20,139
That's in the past.

746
01:24:21,432 --> 01:24:25,395
We'll make another wonderful house, the three of us, together.

747
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:33,194
I'm going outside for a bit.

748
01:24:33,987 --> 01:24:36,322
Arrietty, don't go too far.

749
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:13,359
Niya.

750
01:26:23,721 --> 01:26:25,014
Niya.

751
01:26:43,783 --> 01:26:45,326
Just a little further.

752
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,600
Spiller!

753
01:27:24,407 --> 01:27:26,034
That's the last of it.

754
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:29,495
Come on, we should keep moving.

755
01:27:29,829 --> 01:27:31,247
Okay.

756
01:27:35,668 --> 01:27:37,670
Mother, are you all right?

757
01:27:49,891 --> 01:27:51,267
Arrietty!

758
01:27:51,601 --> 01:27:52,894
Arrietty!

759
01:28:21,798 --> 01:28:22,965
Shawn.

760
01:28:26,928 --> 01:28:28,221
Arrietty.

761
01:28:45,238 --> 01:28:46,948
We have to leave.

762
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:49,450
But Spiller says there's more of us not too far from here.

763
01:28:49,534 --> 01:28:51,410
A two-day's journey, at most.

764
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:53,955
He thinks it might be my mother's family.

765
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:56,457
You won't be the last of your kind.

766
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:58,042
But how did you find me?

767
01:29:00,711 --> 01:29:02,588
Niya here showed me the way.

768
01:29:10,189 --> 01:29:11,587
Thank you, Niya.

769
01:29:11,607 --> 01:29:13,005
Take care of him.

770
01:29:19,397 --> 01:29:20,773
I brought you something.

771
01:29:26,571 --> 01:29:30,324
Now think of it as a gift from one friend to another.

772
01:29:35,788 --> 01:29:37,290
Thank you, Shawn.

773
01:29:51,262 --> 01:29:53,139
I have to go.

774
01:29:54,891 --> 01:29:56,642
When is your operation?

775
01:29:57,486 --> 01:29:58,926
Tomorrow.

776
01:29:58,946 --> 01:30:00,386
But I'm not scared.

777
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:03,065
Because someone taught me how to be brave.

778
01:30:11,949 --> 01:30:13,618
So you'll remember me.

779
01:30:18,915 --> 01:30:20,625
How can I forget you?

780
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:29,634
You protected me after all.

781
01:30:31,594 --> 01:30:33,429
Arrietty.

782
01:30:35,973 --> 01:30:38,851
I hope you have a happy life.

783
01:30:40,853 --> 01:30:42,396
Goodbye, Shawn.

784
01:30:46,567 --> 01:30:50,780
Arrietty, my heart is strong now because you're in it.

785
01:30:51,364 --> 01:30:53,407
And you always will be.

786
01:30:53,491 --> 01:30:54,784
Forever.

787
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:04,543
I never saw her again.

788
01:31:06,212 --> 01:31:16,889
But the following summer I returned and was happy to hear the people in the house down the road talking about how many things in their home had gone missing.

789
01:31:16,973 --> 01:33:35,903
I'm 14 years old, I am pretty I'm a teeny tiny girl, a little lady I live under the kitchen floor Right here, not so far from you Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel blue In my dreams, oh, I wish I could Feel my hair blowing in the wind See the sky and the summer rain Pick a flower from the garden for you Now I know there's another world Butterﬂies floating in the air There is someone out there for me Walking down, picket fence Run my hands along the edge And music plays in my head Hear the song before I go to bed When stars are bright outside my window Wake up to tree boughs filled up with snow And I remember Oh, I remember I remember my summer with you Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes Rolled down windows Hold my hand, hold me close Pick up your phone Wanna hear your voice again Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair I like you, I don't care Why did it have to end?

790
01:33:37,196 --> 01:34:20,197
Summer love with my best friend I'd fly to you All the way across the states I'd fly to you Hear me, the winter day Oh, I'd follow the sun and come right to your door I remember my summer with you Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes Rolled down windows Hold my hand, hold me close Pick up your phone Wanna hear your voice again Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair I like you, I don't care Why did it have to end?

791
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:40,134
Summer love with my best friend I will miss you in summer again when I will miss you in summer again when
