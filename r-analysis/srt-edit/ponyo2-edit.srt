2
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:52,903
Okay.

3
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,745
A goldfish...

4
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:48,890
It's stuck.

5
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,712
That was weird.

6
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,318
Ow!

7
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,885
Is it dead?

8
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,002
It licked me... it's alive.

9
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,173
Sosuke, we're leaving!

10
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,071
Lisa, I caught a goldfish!

11
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,763
This wind feels strange...

12
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:53,947
Sosuke, I'm starting the car!

13
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,229
Did you find her?

14
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,935
What, captured by a human?

15
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,642
This is bad... very bad.

16
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,605
Are you dead?

17
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,153
You're alive!

18
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:07,418
Sosuke!

19
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:09,448
I'm going to be late!

20
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,355
Lisa!

21
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,851
I caught a goldfish.

22
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,495
A goldfish?

23
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,004
Down by the rocks.

24
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,235
I'm sorry, but you can't use weed killer here.

25
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:50,798
Heavens no!

26
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:52,732
This is pure sea water.

27
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:54,666
It keeps me humidified.

28
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,476
As long as it's not weed killer.

29
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,280
Good day!

30
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,351
This is very bad.

31
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,827
What a creepy guy.

32
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:17,163
But don't you say that about strangers, Sosuke.

33
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,736
I won't.

34
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,396
Are you taking that to school?

35
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,864
Won't the teacher complain?

36
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,906
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

37
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,581
She's cute!

38
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,253
They're using the dry dock.

39
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,384
Here, eat this before we get there.

40
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,563
Maybe she's hungry.

41
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,727
Want some?

42
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,399
Hey, my cut is gone!

43
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,405
I'm going to call her Ponyo.

44
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,613
She's really special!

45
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,126
She can do magic.

46
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,477
She fixed my cut.

47
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,628
Want some ham?

48
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,580
- Ponyo likes ham, Lisa!

49
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,560
- That makes two of us.

50
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,628
Oh no...

51
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,967
Disgusting!

52
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,040
Hurry, Lisa!

53
00:14:15,998 --> 00:14:17,258
Such filth!

54
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:18,538
Intolerable!

55
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,058
Good morning!

56
00:14:28,844 --> 00:14:30,138
Look, Ponyo.

57
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:31,452
There's our house.

58
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:53,878
- I'll drop you here.

59
00:14:53,898 --> 00:14:54,941
- Okay.

60
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,118
Have fun.

61
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,820
See you.

62
00:14:59,208 --> 00:14:59,922
Morning.

63
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:00,656
Sorry I'm late.

64
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,664
Could you get Noriko's wheelchair?

65
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,911
Good morning, Sosuke.

66
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:21,424
I'm busy, Yoshie.

67
00:15:21,444 --> 00:15:22,806
Talk to you later.

68
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,183
My!

69
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,790
Hello, Sosuke.

70
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,291
Can't talk now, Toki.

71
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,026
Maybe the teacher will get mad.

72
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,035
I know!

73
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,284
Wait here.

74
00:15:46,304 --> 00:15:47,768
I'll be back soon.

75
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,383
What if a cat comes?

76
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,726
Stay here, I'll be right back.

77
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,437
See you later.

78
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:20,014
It's all right.

79
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:21,561
She'll be just fine.

80
00:16:22,091 --> 00:16:23,220
Okay, thanks.

81
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,369
Bye-bye.

82
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,410
Good morning, teacher.

83
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,811
Hello Sosuke.

84
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,443
How are you?

85
00:16:34,603 --> 00:16:35,680
- Sosuke!

86
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,777
- Kumiko...

87
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:38,552
Like my dress?

88
00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:40,185
Mommy got it for me.

89
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,424
Oh...

90
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,296
Let's play, Sosuke!

91
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:44,455
Not now.

92
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:45,485
I'm busy.

93
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,161
How come?

94
00:16:47,316 --> 00:16:49,042
- I told you, I'm busy.

95
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:50,788
- You're no fun.

96
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,034
Yeah!

97
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,031
Ponyo!

98
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,841
Sosuke!

99
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,067
Kumiko...

100
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,677
What's that?

101
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,870
You're not supposed to bring stuff.

102
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:33,341
But these trees aren't on school grounds.

103
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,747
Show me.

104
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,487
Oh, a goldfish.

105
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:38,810
It's not a goldfish.

106
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,907
It's Ponyo.

107
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:41,181
Ponyo?

108
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:42,313
I want to see!

109
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,686
Promise not to tell?

110
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,058
I promise.

111
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,067
Isn't she cute?

112
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:58,332
It looks fat.

113
00:17:58,352 --> 00:18:00,266
My goldfish is lots cuter.

114
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:24,858
It's Kumiko's fault.

115
00:18:24,878 --> 00:18:27,025
She was mean to you.

116
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,972
I'll give you some more water.

117
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,057
Ponyo!

118
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,075
You scared me.

119
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:12,270
Why, how odd.

120
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,069
That was Sosuke's voice.

121
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:20,120
But he's supposed to be in school.

122
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,452
I must be hearing things.

123
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,822
Here I am, Yoshie.

124
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:30,164
I knew I heard your voice.

125
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,566
Do I have a secret?

126
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:34,603
Yes!

127
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,230
Bingo!

128
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,100
Okay, what color is my secret?

129
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:42,669
- Red!

130
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:43,601
- Red!

131
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,073
Good guess.

132
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,412
How'd you know?

133
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,816
Show us.

134
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,385
All right.

135
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,359
Oh, how pretty!

136
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,018
Very cute!

137
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,423
Her name is Ponyo.

138
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:02,000
She loves ham and she can do magic.

139
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,493
I cut my thumb, but she fixed it.

140
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,370
I wonder if she'd fix our legs.

141
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,504
We could run around just like you.

142
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:20,649
Well, I'd have to ask Ponyo first.

143
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,981
Can I take a look?

144
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,383
Sure, Toki.

145
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,021
Heavens, it has a face!

146
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:34,855
Put it back before it brings a tsunami!

147
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,662
You're so superstitious, Toki.

148
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,571
That's what the old stories say.

149
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,674
Fish like that are bad luck.

150
00:20:46,255 --> 00:20:47,902
The tsunami!

151
00:20:47,922 --> 00:20:49,569
It's here!

152
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,712
The tsunami is here!

153
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,423
What's wrong, Toki?

154
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,992
Just look at my clothes!

155
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,297
Sosuke!

156
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,333
Sosuke!

157
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,149
Sosuke!

158
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,013
Come back here and apologize!

159
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:42,094
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

160
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,331
Sosuke.

161
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,430
Sosuke.

162
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,772
Ponyo!

163
00:21:58,293 --> 00:21:59,422
Ponyo.

164
00:21:59,442 --> 00:22:00,571
Sosuke.

165
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,186
Ponyo... loves...

166
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,379
...Sosuke!

167
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,394
I love you too.

168
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,466
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

169
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,607
Ponyo!

170
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,706
Ponyo!

171
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,049
Ponyo!

172
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,980
Sosuke!

173
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,126
Ponyo!

174
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:18,275
Listen, Sosuke.

175
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:19,839
Maybe it was fate.

176
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,221
It just can't be helped.

177
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,129
Ponyo was born in the sea.

178
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,288
She went back home, that's all.

179
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,665
Anyway, let's hope that creepy guy is gone.

180
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,661
One lick?

181
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,205
Hurry, it's melting!

182
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,975
Not bad!

183
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,807
Cheer up.

184
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:49,440
Koichi will be home tonight.

185
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,615
He'll be disappointed if you're feeling down.

186
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,183
No more ocean today, okay?

187
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,006
Sosuke?

188
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,384
Time to come inside.

189
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,379
Do you think this bucket will help Ponyo find us?

190
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,882
There's only one way to find out.

191
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:17,829
Can you get that, Sosuke?

192
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:19,627
It must be Koichi.

193
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,208
Hello?

194
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,077
Yes, it's me.

195
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,784
Yes, I'm fine.

196
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:30,059
I can't get back tonight.

197
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,209
I'll signal when I'm offshore.

198
00:26:32,534 --> 00:26:33,611
Okay.

199
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:34,708
Here's Lisa.

200
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:37,262
Koichi?

201
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:38,240
Yes...

202
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,218
What?!

203
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,228
Can't you get out of it?

204
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:46,133
Fine... leave your wife and son up on the cliff!

205
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,929
I give up!

206
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,806
Why bother?

207
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,403
C'mon Sosuke, let's eat out!

208
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,242
I want to eat here.

209
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,036
There he is!

210
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,943
Turn off the lights, Lisa.

211
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:56,241
It's Sosuke!

212
00:27:56,261 --> 00:27:57,553
He's a genius.

213
00:27:57,573 --> 00:27:58,865
Only five years old.

214
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,841
Your wife must be upset.

215
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,975
He says he's sorry.

216
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:09,877
J...

217
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:10,612

JERK!!!!!

227
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,570
He says he loves you!

228
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,769
Lots and lots!

229
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:32,966

GOOD LUC...

239
00:28:53,108 --> 00:29:08,634
GOOD LUCK THANKS LOVE AND KISSES Don't cry, Lisa.

240
00:29:08,654 --> 00:29:24,180
I won't cry.

241
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,498
I promised Ponyo I'd take care of her.

242
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,608
I hope she isn't crying.

243
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,538
Okay, let's cheer up!

244
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:49,318
"I'm happy as can be... " Ow!

245
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,944
Don't worry, Sosuke.

246
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:54,183
I'm sure Ponyo is fine too.

247
00:29:57,238 --> 00:29:59,101
Now let's eat.

248
00:29:59,121 --> 00:30:00,984
We'll eat Koichi's dinner too!

249
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,399
This is all my fault.

250
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:17,140
Bringing you along to watch me was a mistake.

251
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:21,248
How often have I warned you about humans?

252
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,749
Their very breath is polluted.

253
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,254
Come, you must eat.

254
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,891
Can't you hear me, Brunhilde?

255
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,184
I want ham!

256
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:35,722
Ham?!

257
00:30:35,742 --> 00:30:37,656
What on earth have you been doing?

258
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,599
Answer me, Brunhilde!

259
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,494
My name's not Brunhilde.

260
00:30:41,514 --> 00:30:43,127
It's Ponyo.

261
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,135
Ponyo?

262
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,706
Ponyo loves Sosuke.

263
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,948
I want to be human!

264
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,710
Human?

265
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,784
How could you love such disgusting creatures?

266
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,351
They rob the sea of life.

267
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,989
I was human myself... once.

268
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,692
I finally escaped that awful heritage.

269
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,492
I want hands!

270
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,134
I don't like this!

271
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,800
I want legs like Sosuke!

272
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,698
Of all the nonsense!

273
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:37,635
Look at me!

274
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:39,353
Hands and feet!

275
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:44,524
No... don't tell me you tasted human blood!

276
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,133
Wanna see Sosuke!

277
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:48,229
No!

278
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:50,197
His blood has deranged your DNA!

279
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,240
Revert... revert...

280
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:01,083
Go back... go back!

281
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,780
It's not working.

282
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,980
I need more power.

283
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,530
Let me out!

284
00:32:22,684 --> 00:32:25,782
Be still, you evil blood.

285
00:32:25,802 --> 00:32:28,900
Revert, revert!

286
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,953
Just like her mother... so strong.

287
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:50,599
She should remain innocent and pure forever.

288
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,289
I can't hold her for long.

289
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,154
I need her mother's help.

290
00:33:26,447 --> 00:33:27,758
No!

291
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:29,089
My elixir is too strong for you!

292
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:30,531
Shoo!

293
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:31,498
Go away!

294
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,801
My crab shields were weakening.

295
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,274
I nearly upset Nature's balance.

296
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:38,609
I must stay calm.

297
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,947
When I think of meeting HER again!

298
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,751
This batch should be ready.

299
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,896
No leaks down here.

300
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,301
This door is loose.

301
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,273
I'll fix it later.

302
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,850
If even one creature got in here!

303
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,113
Superb!

304
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:49,743
I feel the ocean's power in my very DNA.

305
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:54,716
When this well is full, the Era of the Ocean will begin.

306
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,885
An explosion of life to match the Cambrian Era!

307
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:01,157
This revolting era of Man will be over.

308
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,837
Better fix this door.

309
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,023
Teeth!

310
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:43,533
I'm going back to Sosuke!

311
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,577
A waterspout?

312
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,950
Captain, look there!

313
00:39:21,335 --> 00:39:22,930
- Tsunami!

314
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,545
- Turn her into the waves!

315
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,156
What's that?

316
00:39:32,713 --> 00:39:34,206
Captain!

317
00:39:34,226 --> 00:39:35,719
Radio's out, the radar too!

318
00:39:39,453 --> 00:39:41,151
A little girl?

319
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:42,869
She must be Sosuke's age!

320
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:53,944
- Bye-bye.

321
00:39:53,964 --> 00:39:55,041
- See you tomorrow.

322
00:39:56,704 --> 00:39:58,134
- Thanks.

323
00:39:58,154 --> 00:39:59,584
- Take care.

324
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,792
Do you want to wait here for Lisa?

325
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,505
It's okay, I'll take the shortcut.

326
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:07,086
Goodbye.

327
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,804
Goodbye.

328
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,864
Be careful out there.

329
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,023
Sorry, Sosuke.

330
00:40:55,043 --> 00:40:56,706
The power's out.

331
00:40:56,864 --> 00:40:58,391
The door wouldn't open, would it?

332
00:40:58,411 --> 00:40:59,938
Was the school okay?

333
00:41:00,234 --> 00:41:01,943
Go home, Lisa.

334
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:03,672
We'll be fine.

335
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,159
Are you sure?

336
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,929
Don't worry, we'll be just fine.

337
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:10,820
We're spending the night anyway.

338
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,351
You should go while you can.

339
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,034
Wait for me, Sosuke.

340
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,945
Yoshie.

341
00:41:30,931 --> 00:41:33,295
Why, Sosuke.

342
00:41:33,315 --> 00:41:35,679
It's so dark, I didn't see you.

343
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,294
This is for you.

344
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:43,499
My, what is it?

345
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,261
One for you, Noriko.

346
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,869
Thank you.

347
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,469
Can't see a thing.

348
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,474
This is such foolishness!

349
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,579
I don't want to spend the night.

350
00:41:58,926 --> 00:42:01,307
- Oh good, the power's on.

351
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:03,708
- It's a goldfish!

352
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:08,516
Maybe Sosuke's magic made the lights go on?

353
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:10,047
Extremely powerful...

354
00:42:10,067 --> 00:42:11,378
Micro-typhoon...

355
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,053
Ships should exercise extreme caution...

356
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,228
This TV is useless.

357
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:22,370
Those idiots couldn't forecast their way out of a paper bag.

358
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,497
You should go home, Sosuke.

359
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:27,565
Your goldfish will bring us luck.

360
00:42:27,585 --> 00:42:30,131
We're not afraid now.

361
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,489
Here's yours, Toki.

362
00:42:44,038 --> 00:42:45,701
It's all wrinkled.

363
00:42:45,721 --> 00:42:47,384
What is it?

364
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:48,589
Like this.

365
00:42:51,178 --> 00:42:52,142
I know!

366
00:42:52,162 --> 00:42:53,126
It's a grasshopper.

367
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,431
No, the Koganei Maru.

368
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:59,107
That's your father's ship.

369
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:01,670
Still looks like a grasshopper.

370
00:43:02,056 --> 00:43:03,987
We're leaving, Sosuke.

371
00:43:04,007 --> 00:43:05,938
Say goodbye to everyone.

372
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,313
Goodbye, everybody.

373
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,647
Goodbye.

374
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,724
Don't let the wind blow you away!

375
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,455
Climb over.

376
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,000
The phones are out too.

377
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,456
The sea is puffed up!

378
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,827
Will the ships sink?

379
00:43:57,244 --> 00:43:59,556
They're safe out at sea.

380
00:43:59,576 --> 00:44:01,888
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.

381
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,304
- I see fish, Lisa.

382
00:44:15,324 --> 00:44:17,068
- Seat belt!

383
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,159
You've got to turn back!

384
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,894
People are going to the shelters.

385
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:37,607
But there are people at the senior center!

386
00:44:37,885 --> 00:44:39,765
They'll be alright.

387
00:44:39,785 --> 00:44:41,665
They're on the leeward side.

388
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,076
I've just got to get home.

389
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,783
You'd better go around the mountain.

390
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,682
Here we go, Sosuke.

391
00:44:54,134 --> 00:44:54,814
No!

392
00:44:54,834 --> 00:44:55,514
Stop!

393
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,627
Look out for that wave!

394
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:03,991
Here it comes!

395
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,600
Run for it, Lisa!

396
00:45:46,553 --> 00:45:48,046
- The fish are following us.

397
00:45:48,066 --> 00:45:49,559
- Seat belt, Sosuke!

398
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,952
Hold on tight!

399
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:58,910
That wave won't quit!

400
00:47:09,636 --> 00:47:11,447
A little girl fell in.

401
00:47:11,467 --> 00:47:13,278
She was riding a fish.

402
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,699
Where?

403
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,077
The sea keeps rising.

404
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,679
Where did you see her?

405
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,416
Running on top of a fish.

406
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:36,776
A fish!?

407
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:42,685
Come on, Sosuke.

408
00:47:58,852 --> 00:48:00,447
Hang on, Sosuke!

409
00:48:00,467 --> 00:48:02,062
We're almost home.

410
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:57,760
A little girl!

411
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:01,129
Here, you'd better come with us.

412
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,596
Stay there, Sosuke.

413
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,091
Sosuke, do you know her?

414
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:53,750
Ponyo?

415
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:56,921
Yes, it's me!

416
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,955
It's you!

417
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:04,299
Ponyo's a little girl now, Lisa!

418
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,580
I made it!

419
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,933
Now listen, children.

420
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,603
No matter how strange everything seems...

421
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,838
...we have to stay calm.

422
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,506
Now be good.

423
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:53,682
Take off your rain coat, Sosuke.

424
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,510
Here Ponyo, you hold the light.

425
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,215
I'll bring you a towel.

426
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:21,670
C'mon, Ponyo!

427
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,106
It smells just like you!

428
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:29,746
Ouch!

429
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:30,853
Ponyo!

430
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:37,562
Gotcha!

431
00:51:37,582 --> 00:51:39,342
Let's get you dried off.

432
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,662
Such pretty red hair!

433
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,128
But your clothes are dry...

434
00:51:50,684 --> 00:51:52,644
Ponyo was a fish.

435
00:51:52,664 --> 00:51:54,624
Water doesn't make her wet.

436
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:00,144
I like this!

437
00:52:00,494 --> 00:52:02,055
All right!

438
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:03,636
Who wants a hot drink?

439
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:06,151
Help me with the light, Ponyo.

440
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:07,687
Coming!

441
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,283
Think we'll have water?

442
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,359
Sure!

443
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:12,789
Sure!

444
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:16,395
Water!

445
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,261
Water!

446
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,563
We have a tank outside.

447
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,433
What about the gas?

448
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:26,869
Presto!

449
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:27,904
All right!

450
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,134
All right!

451
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,270
It's propane.

452
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,680
Okay, take your seats.

453
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,714
Okay!

454
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:39,754
Over here, Ponyo.

455
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,120
Sit down, like this.

456
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,165
Put your stuff down.

457
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,031
You need your hands.

458
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:57,806
I have feet!

459
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,072
Wow!

460
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:07,206
What are you two doing?

461
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,248
Her feet are like hands.

462
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:31,263
There you go.

463
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,147
This is the best!

464
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,526
That hit the spot.

465
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:34,269
What shall we do now?

466
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,228
I want ham!

467
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,668
She's crazy about ham.

468
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:42,202
Then let's eat.

469
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:45,380
But first let's start the generator.

470
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,947
We need electricity to talk to Koichi.

471
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:53,547
Koichi is my father.

472
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,385
Is he a bad sorcerer?

473
00:54:55,535 --> 00:54:57,233
No, silly.

474
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:58,951
He's a ship captain.

475
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,563
What about your father, Ponyo?

476
00:55:01,941 --> 00:55:03,417
Fujimoto!

477
00:55:03,437 --> 00:55:04,913
He keeps me prisoner.

478
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:08,030
I ran away.

479
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:11,164
What about your mother?

480
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:14,600
I love my mother!

481
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:17,545
She's really scary.

482
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,076
Sounds like Lisa.

483
00:55:24,184 --> 00:55:26,049
Can you help me, Ponyo?

484
00:55:42,068 --> 00:55:44,798
Maybe the fuel's too old?

485
00:55:45,372 --> 00:55:46,566
Is it clogged?

486
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:47,866
Clogged.

487
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:50,305
It's clogged there.

488
00:56:05,292 --> 00:56:06,623
Success!

489
00:56:06,927 --> 00:56:08,758
All bright!

490
00:56:10,497 --> 00:56:12,362
Wow, Ponyo!

491
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,205
Antenna!

492
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:32,070
Antenna!

493
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:35,211
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?

494
00:56:36,623 --> 00:56:38,853
I can't see a single light.

495
00:56:56,743 --> 00:56:58,472
So loud!

496
00:56:58,745 --> 00:56:59,712
What's wrong?

497
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:03,349
Even the radio is out of whack.

498
00:57:04,561 --> 00:57:06,623
This is JA4LL...

499
00:57:06,643 --> 00:57:08,705
JA4LL.

500
00:57:09,022 --> 00:57:10,853
Come in, Kolchl.

501
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:13,097
It's Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.

502
00:57:13,117 --> 00:57:15,213
We're all doing fine.

503
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,860
We're going to have dinner.

504
00:57:19,366 --> 00:57:20,731
Ham!

505
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:31,433
Ready?

506
00:57:31,453 --> 00:57:33,367
Careful, it's hot.

507
00:57:48,862 --> 00:57:50,227
It's not ready yet.

508
00:57:50,797 --> 00:57:52,458
It takes three minutes.

509
00:58:07,347 --> 00:58:08,939
Close your eyes!

510
00:58:09,983 --> 00:58:11,610
Not yet!

511
00:58:13,987 --> 00:58:15,887
No peeking, Ponyo.

512
00:58:19,592 --> 00:58:21,617
Okay, you can look now.

513
00:58:22,429 --> 00:58:24,624
And... presto!

514
00:58:30,971 --> 00:58:31,995
Ham!

515
00:58:32,138 --> 00:58:33,765
Good for you, Ponyo.

516
00:58:55,161 --> 00:58:57,186
Ponyo went to sleep.

517
00:59:04,437 --> 00:59:06,735
Is her home far away?

518
00:59:06,873 --> 00:59:08,864
I think it must be.

519
00:59:24,567 --> 00:59:25,946
Look Sosuke.

520
00:59:25,966 --> 00:59:27,345
The sea is calmer.

521
00:59:28,395 --> 00:59:29,862
Because Ponyo's asleep?

522
00:59:29,996 --> 00:59:31,827
Look over there!

523
00:59:39,616 --> 00:59:40,876
It's moving.

524
00:59:40,896 --> 00:59:42,156
Someone's up there.

525
00:59:42,642 --> 00:59:44,439
People from the senior center?

526
00:59:51,017 --> 00:59:52,143
It's gone.

527
00:59:52,285 --> 00:59:53,980
That's the peak road.

528
00:59:57,724 --> 00:59:59,715
Sosuke, stay there with Ponyo.

529
01:00:11,071 --> 01:00:15,064
Maybe I could get through on the mountain road.

530
01:00:17,977 --> 01:00:20,468
I'm going to the senior center.

531
01:00:20,613 --> 01:00:21,773
I'll go too.

532
01:00:23,016 --> 01:00:25,041
Stay here with Ponyo.

533
01:00:25,295 --> 01:00:26,942
I'm going too.

534
01:00:26,962 --> 01:00:28,609
Let's take Ponyo with us.

535
01:00:29,355 --> 01:00:30,788
I'm going with you!

536
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:36,825
Sosuke, our house is a lighthouse in the storm.

537
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:40,966
Everyone out there is depending on us.

538
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:43,067
Someone has to stay here.

539
01:00:44,037 --> 01:00:48,804
Lots of things are happening that I don't understand.

540
01:00:48,942 --> 01:00:53,436
But right now I'm worried about the people at the senior center.

541
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:58,139
Just knowing you're here will help me.

542
01:00:58,361 --> 01:00:59,825
Don't worry.

543
01:00:59,845 --> 01:01:01,309
I promise to come back.

544
01:01:02,822 --> 01:01:03,811
Promise?

545
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:06,622
I promise.

546
01:01:06,759 --> 01:01:08,283
You promised!

547
01:01:09,229 --> 01:01:10,821
I love you, Sosuke.

548
01:02:05,552 --> 01:02:08,885
I see the lights of the town!

549
01:02:09,155 --> 01:02:10,144
Finally...

550
01:02:10,557 --> 01:02:12,320
Now we can navigate.

551
01:02:12,525 --> 01:02:14,959
I've never seen that town before.

552
01:02:20,733 --> 01:02:23,531
Did the storm blow us to America?

553
01:02:41,297 --> 01:02:42,944
That's not a mountain.

554
01:02:42,964 --> 01:02:44,611
And that's no harbor...

555
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,288
Those are ships!

556
01:02:56,369 --> 01:02:59,429
The sea is piled up into a mountain!

557
01:03:00,016 --> 01:03:02,146
It's a ship graveyard.

558
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:04,296
What's going on?

559
01:03:09,415 --> 01:03:10,746
We lost power!

560
01:03:10,893 --> 01:03:12,369
Heave to!

561
01:03:12,389 --> 01:03:13,865
Drop the sea anchor!

562
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,180
Aye-aye!

563
01:03:28,501 --> 01:03:30,264
Something is coming!

564
01:03:58,264 --> 01:04:00,027
A sea goddess!?

565
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:11,634
The engine!

566
01:04:11,778 --> 01:04:12,904
We're saved!

567
01:04:13,056 --> 01:04:14,549
The engine started again.

568
01:04:14,569 --> 01:04:16,062
It was Her!

569
01:04:16,215 --> 01:04:19,776
Protect us from harm...

570
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,809
Come on, come on.

571
01:05:02,238 --> 01:05:04,687
A barrier spell!

572
01:05:04,707 --> 01:05:07,156
Where did she learn this?

573
01:05:24,884 --> 01:05:27,648
Good heavens... she's human!

574
01:05:28,765 --> 01:05:30,213
Hey, watch out!

575
01:05:30,233 --> 01:05:31,681
What are you doing?

576
01:05:39,742 --> 01:05:41,070
Stop!

577
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:42,418
This is unsafe!

578
01:05:45,505 --> 01:05:46,870
Stop that at once!

579
01:05:54,647 --> 01:05:57,980
I'm simply trying to save your sister.

580
01:06:03,332 --> 01:06:04,825
She's here.

581
01:06:04,845 --> 01:06:06,338
She answered my call!

582
01:06:43,172 --> 01:06:44,932
- Fujimoto...

583
01:06:44,952 --> 01:06:46,712
- You came, my beloved.

584
01:06:47,567 --> 01:06:49,467
Such a beautiful ocean.

585
01:06:53,272 --> 01:06:58,266
So full of magic, like my ancient Devonian sea.

586
01:06:58,421 --> 01:06:59,732
It's Ponyo!

587
01:06:59,752 --> 01:07:01,063
She tasted human blood...

588
01:07:01,214 --> 01:07:04,342
...and plundered all of my elixir.

589
01:07:05,218 --> 01:07:08,949
Ponyo... what a lovely name.

590
01:07:14,594 --> 01:07:16,357
It's all my fault.

591
01:07:17,106 --> 01:07:19,270
She's totally beyond my control.

592
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:21,454
It's complete chaos.

593
01:07:21,601 --> 01:07:24,195
She doesn't understand what she's done.

594
01:07:24,637 --> 01:07:29,973
Now she's human, and she's up there with her boyfriend!

595
01:07:30,843 --> 01:07:34,370
If we don't stop her, the planet is doomed!

596
01:07:43,299 --> 01:07:44,644
No!

597
01:07:44,664 --> 01:07:46,009
The satellites are falling.

598
01:07:46,158 --> 01:07:48,718
Earth's gravitational field...

599
01:07:50,062 --> 01:07:51,723
Be still...

600
01:07:58,938 --> 01:08:02,806
Sosuke... that is his name, yes?

601
01:08:06,245 --> 01:08:10,079
You love your sister, don't you?

602
01:08:13,553 --> 01:08:17,284
Listen, dear... what if Ponyo really became human?

603
01:08:18,157 --> 01:08:19,818
Use the old magic.

604
01:08:20,026 --> 01:08:24,793
If Sosuke's love is real, she'll lose her powers forever.

605
01:08:25,064 --> 01:08:29,558
But if it's not, she'll turn to sea foam!

606
01:08:29,969 --> 01:08:33,803
That's where we all came from, dear.

607
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,773
But he's only five!

608
01:08:42,081 --> 01:08:45,778
Sleep well, little children.

609
01:08:58,798 --> 01:08:59,924
Sosuke!

610
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,628
Sosuke!

611
01:09:03,869 --> 01:09:05,496
Ow!

612
01:09:08,107 --> 01:09:09,768
Good morning, Ponyo.

613
01:09:10,142 --> 01:09:12,508
Morning, Sosuke.

614
01:09:18,751 --> 01:09:21,311
We almost got flooded.

615
01:09:44,754 --> 01:09:46,748
- Where's Lisa?

616
01:09:46,768 --> 01:09:48,762
- She must be stuck someplace.

617
01:09:48,914 --> 01:09:51,747
I wish we had a boat.

618
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,444
There's a boat!

619
01:09:58,658 --> 01:09:59,852
We can't fit.

620
01:09:59,992 --> 01:10:01,619
Can so.

621
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:18,502
Awesome!

622
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:23,471
The candle's bigger too.

623
01:10:23,616 --> 01:10:24,913
We can fit.

624
01:10:25,051 --> 01:10:26,279
This is cool.

625
01:10:26,485 --> 01:10:27,782
Cool!

626
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,080
Grab that end.

627
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:34,084
Ready?

628
01:10:34,393 --> 01:10:35,621
Ready!

629
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:50,402
She's seaworthy!

630
01:10:52,722 --> 01:10:53,902
Awesome.

631
01:10:53,922 --> 01:10:55,102
No leaks!

632
01:10:55,247 --> 01:10:57,681
Now we fill the boiler.

633
01:10:58,384 --> 01:11:00,852
The water goes in here.

634
01:11:01,353 --> 01:11:03,947
It goes in the boiler.

635
01:11:31,317 --> 01:11:32,978
It's like a rocket!

636
01:11:40,192 --> 01:11:41,625
Everything's shipshape.

637
01:11:41,827 --> 01:11:43,351
Shipshape...

638
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,119
Shipshape?

639
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:45,992
Shipshape!

640
01:11:46,275 --> 01:11:47,586
Shipshape!

641
01:11:47,606 --> 01:11:48,917
Shipshape!

642
01:12:12,024 --> 01:12:13,150
Is it hot?

643
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:14,554
Hot!

644
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:21,027
It's hot.

645
01:12:24,013 --> 01:12:25,307
- The candle's burning.

646
01:12:25,327 --> 01:12:26,621
- It's burning!

647
01:12:26,906 --> 01:12:30,307
Hot hot hot!

648
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:39,782
It's hot.

649
01:12:50,696 --> 01:12:51,993
Awesome!

650
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:56,666
We're shipshape, Sosuke!

651
01:12:56,936 --> 01:12:58,733
This is great.

652
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:08,204
This is so much fun.

653
01:13:09,481 --> 01:13:12,075
It's burning, Sosuke.

654
01:13:12,551 --> 01:13:14,678
It's really hot.

655
01:13:15,431 --> 01:13:17,294
Keep a lookout in front.

656
01:13:17,314 --> 01:13:19,177
I'll steer the boat.

657
01:13:19,725 --> 01:13:21,386
Okay, I'm the lookout.

658
01:13:48,454 --> 01:13:49,978
There's a road.

659
01:13:50,122 --> 01:13:52,113
That's the road Lisa took.

660
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,252
I don't see her.

661
01:13:56,639 --> 01:13:58,337
You will.

662
01:13:58,357 --> 01:14:00,055
She gave me her promise.

663
01:14:04,837 --> 01:14:08,068
Ancient fish... from the Devonian age!

664
01:14:08,207 --> 01:14:10,300
There's Bothriolepis.

665
01:14:15,447 --> 01:14:16,505
That one is...

666
01:14:16,782 --> 01:14:17,749
Dipnorhynchus.

667
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:19,417
Dipnorhynchus!

668
01:14:19,618 --> 01:14:21,882
That one's really huge.

669
01:14:22,154 --> 01:14:23,849
That's Devonynchus.

670
01:14:24,056 --> 01:14:26,217
Devonynchus!

671
01:14:32,564 --> 01:14:34,828
Ahoy!

672
01:14:38,137 --> 01:14:39,104
A boat!

673
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:41,831
Ahoy!

674
01:14:43,142 --> 01:14:44,837
They're calling us.

675
01:14:46,045 --> 01:14:47,842
Ahoy!

676
01:14:49,715 --> 01:14:50,977
Ow!

677
01:14:58,157 --> 01:14:59,488
Pretty good, huh?

678
01:15:03,262 --> 01:15:04,854
Now, Ponyo.

679
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:13,195
Hello.

680
01:15:13,405 --> 01:15:16,067
That's a wonderful boat you have.

681
01:15:16,275 --> 01:15:19,267
Why, you're Lisa's little boy.

682
01:15:19,578 --> 01:15:22,069
He's not little, he's Sosuke.

683
01:15:22,281 --> 01:15:23,805
This is Ponyo.

684
01:15:24,817 --> 01:15:26,876
I was a fish before.

685
01:15:27,252 --> 01:15:28,685
A fish?

686
01:15:29,488 --> 01:15:31,388
Ponyo... that's a nice name.

687
01:15:33,726 --> 01:15:35,626
Have you seen Lisa?

688
01:15:35,828 --> 01:15:37,159
Lisa?

689
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:39,824
She's not with you?

690
01:15:39,965 --> 01:15:41,262
She's at the center.

691
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,765
The senior center?

692
01:15:42,968 --> 01:15:44,401
This is my baby.

693
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,925
Oh my, what happened?

694
01:16:22,908 --> 01:16:24,535
Is that for us?

695
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:40,219
Give me the cup, dear.

696
01:16:45,097 --> 01:16:46,291
Thank you.

697
01:16:46,765 --> 01:16:48,494
Let's try it.

698
01:16:52,371 --> 01:16:54,032
It's delicious!

699
01:16:54,673 --> 01:16:56,573
Lisa made it.

700
01:16:57,009 --> 01:16:58,306
It's for the baby.

701
01:16:59,088 --> 01:17:01,548
Oh, I'm sorry.

702
01:17:01,568 --> 01:17:04,028
He can't handle soup yet.

703
01:17:04,316 --> 01:17:08,309
But this will help me make milk for him.

704
01:17:10,556 --> 01:17:12,820
Lisa gave me her milk too.

705
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:16,656
Ponyo, may I have this soup?

706
01:17:16,795 --> 01:17:18,660
Sure.

707
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:20,530
Thank you.

708
01:17:37,893 --> 01:17:39,602
People from the town.

709
01:17:39,622 --> 01:17:41,331
It's like a festival.

710
01:17:41,797 --> 01:17:44,007
You there!

711
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:46,237
Do you need assistance?

712
01:17:46,725 --> 01:17:51,492
Thanks, we're okay right now!

713
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:54,590
Then please follow us.

714
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,735
We're going to the hotel on the peak.

715
01:17:58,013 --> 01:17:59,443
Okay!

716
01:17:59,463 --> 01:18:00,893
Will do.

717
01:18:02,474 --> 01:18:03,907
The whole town's here.

718
01:18:04,109 --> 01:18:06,634
I hope everyone's all right.

719
01:18:06,855 --> 01:18:08,564
- Let's go, Ponyo.

720
01:18:08,584 --> 01:18:10,293
- Hold on a second.

721
01:18:16,021 --> 01:18:16,988
Milk!

722
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:19,389
Oh my...

723
01:18:20,425 --> 01:18:21,483
Milk!

724
01:18:21,627 --> 01:18:24,118
She ate up all the ham.

725
01:18:24,263 --> 01:18:27,164
This will help me make good milk.

726
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:31,529
Can you use another candle for your boat, Sosuke?

727
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,327
Thanks.

728
01:18:33,347 --> 01:18:34,994
Ponyo will make it bigger.

729
01:18:35,974 --> 01:18:37,032
Be careful!

730
01:18:37,176 --> 01:18:38,803
Thank you both!

731
01:18:44,783 --> 01:18:46,341
What is it, dear?

732
01:18:50,889 --> 01:18:52,413
Don't cry.

733
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:13,102
Ponyo!

734
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:27,381
Sosuke!

735
01:19:29,371 --> 01:19:30,784
Where's Lisa?

736
01:19:30,804 --> 01:19:32,217
Isn't she with you?

737
01:19:32,497 --> 01:19:35,694
I'm going to pick her up.

738
01:19:35,968 --> 01:19:39,335
So she survived that wave?

739
01:19:39,805 --> 01:19:42,433
Sosuke, take me with you!

740
01:19:42,851 --> 01:19:44,179
Later, Kumiko.

741
01:19:44,199 --> 01:19:45,527
I'm busy now.

742
01:19:45,811 --> 01:19:49,212
Everyone from the center evacuated to the park.

743
01:19:49,424 --> 01:19:50,501
- Keep safe!

744
01:19:50,521 --> 01:19:51,598
- You can do it!

745
01:19:52,084 --> 01:19:55,747
We'll send a boat for them later.

746
01:19:55,988 --> 01:19:58,218
Good luck, captain!

747
01:20:47,272 --> 01:20:50,139
Time for a new candle, Ponyo.

748
01:20:53,989 --> 01:20:55,550
We're okay.

749
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:57,131
I have another one.

750
01:20:57,926 --> 01:20:59,390
Ow!

751
01:20:59,410 --> 01:21:00,874
It's still pretty hot.

752
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:08,653
Bye-bye.

753
01:21:09,461 --> 01:21:12,828
Can you make this candle bigger?

754
01:21:13,031 --> 01:21:14,498
All right.

755
01:21:20,038 --> 01:21:22,905
Are you sleepy, Ponyo?

756
01:21:30,082 --> 01:21:31,310
Ponyo!

757
01:21:47,275 --> 01:21:48,086
Ponyo!

758
01:21:48,106 --> 01:21:48,917
Ponyo!

759
01:22:46,858 --> 01:22:49,326
Good... it's shallow enough to walk.

760
01:23:15,821 --> 01:23:17,288
A road!

761
01:23:29,968 --> 01:23:31,230
It's shrinking!

762
01:23:32,904 --> 01:23:34,303
Ponyo!

763
01:23:56,127 --> 01:23:58,152
Ponyo, wake up!

764
01:24:00,832 --> 01:24:02,595
Sosuke...

765
01:24:08,507 --> 01:24:09,997
Don't scare me.

766
01:24:10,208 --> 01:24:13,268
I thought you were turning into a fish.

767
01:24:25,524 --> 01:24:26,513
Lisa's car!

768
01:24:26,925 --> 01:24:29,086
Ponyo, that's her car!

769
01:24:32,998 --> 01:24:34,795
Lisa!

770
01:24:38,169 --> 01:24:39,101
Lisa!

771
01:24:43,108 --> 01:24:44,837
Lisa!

772
01:24:47,012 --> 01:24:48,741
Lisa!

773
01:24:57,188 --> 01:24:59,349
Lisa!

774
01:25:02,027 --> 01:25:03,619
Lisa!

775
01:25:32,123 --> 01:25:34,421
Here's your boat.

776
01:25:34,593 --> 01:25:37,528
Your eyes are wet.

777
01:25:44,235 --> 01:25:46,203
Let's find Lisa.

778
01:26:33,495 --> 01:26:34,908
- You forgot your wrap!

779
01:26:34,928 --> 01:26:36,341
- Who needs it?

780
01:26:36,488 --> 01:26:38,979
Look, it's a whale!

781
01:26:40,001 --> 01:26:42,729
- My knees don't hurt anymore!

782
01:26:42,749 --> 01:26:45,477
- What were we so afraid of?

783
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,754
- Is this the Other Side?

784
01:26:46,774 --> 01:26:47,888
- Who cares?

785
01:26:47,908 --> 01:26:49,022
It's wonderful.

786
01:26:51,413 --> 01:26:52,923
Attention, please!

787
01:26:52,943 --> 01:26:54,453
Gather round.

788
01:26:54,773 --> 01:26:56,070
Coming!

789
01:26:56,207 --> 01:26:57,868
Shall we?

790
01:27:00,111 --> 01:27:02,102
It's so nice to run.

791
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:04,280
Meet you there!

792
01:27:07,452 --> 01:27:09,386
The winner!

793
01:27:11,456 --> 01:27:13,720
You're so fast, Kayo.

794
01:27:14,492 --> 01:27:16,187
Quiet, everyone!

795
01:27:17,062 --> 01:27:19,326
The moment of truth is at hand.

796
01:27:19,564 --> 01:27:22,032
Sosuke and Ponyo are almost here.

797
01:27:22,167 --> 01:27:23,600
It's so romantic.

798
01:27:23,745 --> 01:27:25,824
- Will love triumph?

799
01:27:25,844 --> 01:27:27,923
- I'm so excited!

800
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:30,602
Quiet!

801
01:27:30,742 --> 01:27:35,941
Very soon, you will bear witness to a sacred trial of love.

802
01:27:37,325 --> 01:27:39,506
Mr.

803
01:27:39,526 --> 01:27:41,707
Fujimoto, you're not up to something, are you?

804
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,889
Nonsense, he's her father.

805
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:49,356
They'll be fine... if she doesn't wake up.

806
01:27:49,527 --> 01:27:51,222
Now excuse me!

807
01:27:59,537 --> 01:28:01,835
I'd like to believe him...

808
01:28:01,973 --> 01:28:04,407
Where's Lisa gone to?

809
01:28:04,576 --> 01:28:09,309
She's been talking with Ponyo's mother for ages.

810
01:28:17,355 --> 01:28:19,915
I hope she's okay.

811
01:28:20,058 --> 01:28:22,652
What are they talking about?

812
01:28:22,804 --> 01:28:24,115
Let's find out.

813
01:28:24,135 --> 01:28:25,446
Lisa!

814
01:28:25,597 --> 01:28:28,828
Lisa!

815
01:28:34,405 --> 01:28:41,368
We're all rooting for Sosuke and Ponyo!

816
01:28:54,692 --> 01:28:55,886
Lisa!

817
01:28:56,037 --> 01:28:57,763
- You must be worried.

818
01:28:57,783 --> 01:28:59,509
- Sosuke will be just fine.

819
01:28:59,664 --> 01:29:02,292
He's a strong little boy.

820
01:29:03,278 --> 01:29:05,056
Thanks, everyone.

821
01:29:05,076 --> 01:29:06,854
He'll need your support.

822
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:17,548
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.

823
01:29:25,723 --> 01:29:35,325
"STOP" I've been here before.

824
01:29:36,434 --> 01:29:37,560
Ponyo?

825
01:29:37,969 --> 01:29:39,903
I don't like this place.

826
01:29:44,075 --> 01:29:46,100
Don't let go of my hand.

827
01:30:24,082 --> 01:30:25,413
Ponyo!

828
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:45,536
Ponyo!

829
01:30:53,912 --> 01:30:54,879
Ponyo!

830
01:31:16,834 --> 01:31:19,132
Please don't die!

831
01:31:19,570 --> 01:31:21,265
Ponyo!

832
01:31:22,073 --> 01:31:24,541
Wake up, Ponyo!

833
01:31:24,676 --> 01:31:27,270
Let her sleep.

834
01:31:28,346 --> 01:31:30,314
I've been waiting for you, Sosuke.

835
01:31:30,448 --> 01:31:33,781
Lisa and the old ladies are waiting too.

836
01:31:34,752 --> 01:31:35,776
Lisa?!

837
01:31:35,997 --> 01:31:37,695
Won't you come with me?

838
01:31:37,715 --> 01:31:39,413
You and Ponyo.

839
01:31:42,193 --> 01:31:44,923
Let's not wake her.

840
01:31:45,063 --> 01:31:47,224
Sosuke!

841
01:31:47,598 --> 01:31:50,499
Don't listen to him!

842
01:31:51,102 --> 01:31:54,367
He tricked everyone into going with him.

843
01:31:54,505 --> 01:31:55,301
Toki!

844
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,374
But he couldn't fool me!

845
01:31:58,186 --> 01:32:00,930
There's no time, I tell you.

846
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:03,694
Don't you see what's happening?

847
01:32:03,848 --> 01:32:07,375
If the Moon comes any closer, we're finished!

848
01:32:07,752 --> 01:32:10,778
Is that the best you can do?

849
01:32:11,255 --> 01:32:13,655
Sosuke, come here!

850
01:32:13,868 --> 01:32:15,566
Listen to me, Sosuke.

851
01:32:15,586 --> 01:32:17,284
You're the planet's last hope.

852
01:32:17,428 --> 01:32:19,362
Don't make me use force.

853
01:32:20,832 --> 01:32:21,992
Ponyo!

854
01:32:23,568 --> 01:32:26,196
Is this how you treat your father?

855
01:32:33,044 --> 01:32:34,306
Ponyo!

856
01:32:34,445 --> 01:32:37,039
Run, Sosuke!

857
01:32:37,181 --> 01:32:39,411
You don't understand!

858
01:32:44,489 --> 01:32:46,150
You can make it!

859
01:32:48,259 --> 01:32:49,658
Jump!

860
01:33:28,966 --> 01:33:30,263
Now what?

861
01:34:25,189 --> 01:34:26,121
Lisa!

862
01:34:26,257 --> 01:34:27,451
Sosuke!

863
01:34:27,692 --> 01:34:28,852
Ponyo!

864
01:34:33,908 --> 01:34:35,652
- Look over there.

865
01:34:35,672 --> 01:34:37,416
- Where are we?

866
01:34:47,812 --> 01:34:49,939
So, you are Sosuke.

867
01:34:50,158 --> 01:34:51,805
Hello.

868
01:34:51,825 --> 01:34:53,472
Are you Ponyo's mother?

869
01:34:53,751 --> 01:34:54,683
Yes.

870
01:34:55,186 --> 01:34:59,680
I want to thank you for bringing my daughter back to me.

871
01:35:00,324 --> 01:35:05,785
Ponyo wanted to be like you, but she unleashed a terrible power.

872
01:35:06,864 --> 01:35:10,732
To become human, she must be loved...

873
01:35:10,868 --> 01:35:13,803
...for who she really is.

874
01:35:14,305 --> 01:35:18,366
Do you know that Ponyo was a fish?

875
01:35:18,609 --> 01:35:19,576
Yes.

876
01:35:19,710 --> 01:35:23,669
Your blood made her human... almost.

877
01:35:23,814 --> 01:35:24,781
That's right!

878
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:28,374
Ponyo licked my cut and made it better.

879
01:35:28,519 --> 01:35:30,919
So that's why she changed!

880
01:35:32,023 --> 01:35:35,686
Can you accept her as she is?

881
01:35:36,027 --> 01:35:38,086
I'll always love Ponyo...

882
01:35:38,262 --> 01:35:40,787
...whether she's a fish, a human...

883
01:35:40,932 --> 01:35:43,332
...or in between.

884
01:35:56,681 --> 01:35:59,047
Come, Ponyo.

885
01:36:13,331 --> 01:36:18,132
Sosuke has promised to accept you as you are.

886
01:36:20,972 --> 01:36:24,635
But first, you must give up your powers.

887
01:36:25,176 --> 01:36:26,837
Can you do that?

888
01:36:37,054 --> 01:36:40,751
Kiss this bubble when you return to land...

889
01:36:40,891 --> 01:36:45,260
...and Ponyo will be a little girl.

890
01:36:48,065 --> 01:36:50,363
Way to go, Ponyo!

891
01:36:51,068 --> 01:36:53,730
Thank you, Ponyo's mother!

892
01:36:59,577 --> 01:37:03,172
Now the planet is safe again.

893
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:08,443
Splendid, Sosuke!

894
01:37:14,659 --> 01:37:16,354
Sosuke!

895
01:37:40,284 --> 01:37:42,115
I'm grateful, Lisa.

896
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:45,182
Thank you, Gran Mamare.

897
01:37:56,610 --> 01:37:58,223
There you are!

898
01:37:58,243 --> 01:37:59,856
Are you all right?

899
01:38:04,842 --> 01:38:06,810
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.

900
01:38:06,944 --> 01:38:09,105
Don't bother, we'll walk.

901
01:38:09,246 --> 01:38:11,680
It's all so exciting.

902
01:38:14,952 --> 01:38:16,681
I believe this is yours.

903
01:38:19,223 --> 01:38:20,190
Thanks.

904
01:38:20,758 --> 01:38:24,694
I hope you'll forgive me... may I?

905
01:38:30,434 --> 01:38:32,493
Take good care of her.

906
01:38:34,805 --> 01:38:36,705
It's Koichi!

907
01:38:40,911 --> 01:38:42,970
Koichi!

908
01:38:46,494 --> 01:38:48,157
It's Lisa!

909
01:38:48,177 --> 01:38:49,840
And there's Sosuke!

910
01:38:52,199 --> 01:38:53,743
Look, Ponyo.

911
01:38:53,763 --> 01:38:55,307
It's Koichi!

912
01:39:14,188 --> 01:39:28,103
