1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,981
Tokuma Shoten, Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Walt Disney Japan, Tohokushinsha Film and Mitsubishi present Good luck, Chihiro Hope we meet again Chihiro?

2
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:18,882
Chihiro!

3
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,561
We're almost there.

4
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,482
This really is the middle of nowhere.

5
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:28,402
I'll have to shop in the next town.

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,612
We'll just have to make do.

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,034
Look, there's the elementary school.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,952
That's your new school, Chihiro.

9
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,080
Why, it looks very nice.

10
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,923
I liked my old school.

11
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,972
Mom, my flowers got bent.

12
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,683
No wonder, the way you squeeze them.

13
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,770
A little water and they'll perk right up.

14
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,399
My first bouquet, and it's farewell flowers.

15
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,986
What about the rose you got for your birthday?

16
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:12,603
One rose?

17
00:01:12,623 --> 00:01:14,104
One rose isn't a bouquet.

18
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,908
You dropped the card.

19
00:01:16,044 --> 00:01:18,213
Now pull yourself together.

20
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,402
This is a busy day for us.

21
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:50,391
SPIRITED AWAY Wait a minute.

22
00:01:50,411 --> 00:02:01,151
Did I take a wrong turn?

23
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,080
I don't get it.

24
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,332
That must be it up there.

25
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,210
The blue one on the end.

26
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,962
That's it.

27
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,048
I guess I turned off too soon.

28
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,175
Maybe if we go straight?

29
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:16,584
Oh, please.

30
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:17,835
That's how we always get lost.

31
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,972
Let's just see what's up here.

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,193
- What are those things?

33
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:24,006
- Houses for the guardian spirits.

34
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,484
Dad, are you sure?

35
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,195
Don't worry, we've got 4-wheel drive.

36
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,156
Sit down, Chihiro.

37
00:02:57,353 --> 00:02:58,480
What are you doing?

38
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,627
Slow down!

39
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,472
There's a tunnel.

40
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,655
What's this building?

41
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,616
It looks like a gate.

42
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,578
Honey, I think we should go back.

43
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,622
Chihiro!

44
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,124
Honestly...

45
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,877
Look at this, it's just plaster.

46
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,087
This thing's pretty new.

47
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,599
The air's blowing in.

48
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,184
What is it?

49
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,603
Let's see what's on the other side.

50
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,283
It's creepy, Dad.

51
00:03:51,303 --> 00:03:52,346
Can't we go back?

52
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:54,786
Don't be such a chicken.

53
00:03:54,806 --> 00:03:56,767
C'mon, let's take a look.

54
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,112
The movers will be there soon.

55
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:00,577
So?

56
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:01,925
They've got the keys.

57
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:03,273
They'll handle everything.

58
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,451
I know, but...

59
00:04:04,587 --> 00:04:05,547
No!

60
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:06,527
I won't go.

61
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,582
Dad, let's go.

62
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,167
Come on, it'll be fun.

63
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,002
I'm staying here!

64
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,763
Chihiro, you wait in the car.

65
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,600
Mom...

66
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,895
Wait up!

67
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,069
Watch your step.

68
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:40,853
Chihiro, don't cling.

69
00:04:40,873 --> 00:04:42,521
You'll make me trip.

70
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:16,201
- What is this?

71
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:17,848
- Wait, hear that?

72
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:28,087
- A train.

73
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:29,525
- Maybe we're near a station.

74
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:30,611
Let's find out.

75
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,528
It must be close.

76
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,494
Houses, way out here?

77
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,245
I knew it.

78
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,415
It's an abandoned theme park.

79
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,587
They built lots of them back in the nineties.

80
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,256
But they went bust when the economy tanked.

81
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,926
This must be one of them.

82
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,011
Wait, where are we going?

83
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,764
Let's go back, Dad.

84
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,394
Please!

85
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,906
Mom, that building's moaning.

86
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,241
It's just the wind.

87
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:51,984
What a lovely spot.

88
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:54,236
We should've brought the sandwiches.

89
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,126
This would've been a river.

90
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,258
Do you smell something?

91
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:08,584
- Something smells good.

92
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:10,169
- You're right.

93
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,098
Maybe they're open for business after all.

94
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,975
Hurry up, Chihiro.

95
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,185
Wait for me!

96
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,636
This way.

97
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:57,487
Can you believe it?

98
00:07:57,507 --> 00:07:59,176
Nothing but restaurants.

99
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,521
There's nobody here.

100
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,484
Over there.

101
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,823
Come on!

102
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,544
Come take a look.

103
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,299
This is amazing.

104
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,344
Hello, is anybody here?

105
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,669
Come on, Chihiro.

106
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:34,878
It looks delicious.

107
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,348
You got customers!

108
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:43,074
Don't worry.

109
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:44,804
We'll pay when they show up.

110
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:46,203
You're right.

111
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:47,475
Let's see now...

112
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,736
What kind of bird is this?

113
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:52,897
It's delicious!

114
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,357
Chihiro, try some.

115
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,867
I don't want any.

116
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:57,526
Can't we go?

117
00:08:57,546 --> 00:08:58,985
They'll be mad at us.

118
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,415
Don't worry, your father's here.

119
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,709
I've got credit cards and cash.

120
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:10,039
Have some, Chihiro.

121
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:11,374
It's very tender.

122
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:14,105
- Mustard.

123
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,085
- Thanks.

124
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:27,139
Mom!

125
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,473
Dad!

126
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,387
What a weird building.

127
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,919
A train!

128
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:22,442
You can't be here.

129
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:23,380
Go now!

130
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:25,903
It's almost sundown.

131
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:27,383
Go before it gets dark!

132
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:31,117
They're lighting the lamps.

133
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:32,180
Come on!

134
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:33,598
I'll hold them off.

135
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:34,890
Get across the river!

136
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,251
What's his problem?

137
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,969
Dad?

138
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,596
Dad, let's go home.

139
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,473
Let's go, Dad!

140
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,752
Dad!

141
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,295
Mom!

142
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,765
Mommy!

143
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,829
Water!

144
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,511
No...

145
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,387
It's just a dream.

146
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,069
Wake up, wake up.

147
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:31,257
Wake up!

148
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,270
Please wake up.

149
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,028
It's just a dream, a stupid dream.

150
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,114
Go away, disappear.

151
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,908
Disappear.

152
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,417
I'm fading away!

153
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,673
This has to be a dream.

154
00:14:54,486 --> 00:14:55,613
Don't be afraid.

155
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:56,760
I'm a friend.

156
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,938
No, no, no!

157
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,201
Open your mouth.

158
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:01,056
Eat this.

159
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,027
Unless you eat something from this world, you'll disappear.

160
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,445
No!

161
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:11,066
Don't worry.

162
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:12,609
You won't turn into a pig.

163
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,621
Chew it and swallow.

164
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,633
Good, now you'll be fine.

165
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,468
See for yourself.

166
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,936
I can touch you.

167
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:39,199
Of course.

168
00:15:39,219 --> 00:15:40,346
Now come.

169
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:42,473
Where's Mom and Dad?

170
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:44,475
Did they really turn into pigs?

171
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,236
You can't see them now, but you will.

172
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,532
Quiet!

173
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:11,272
It's looking for you.

174
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:12,877
There's no time, let's run.

175
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:15,380
I can't stand up.

176
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,672
What should I do?

177
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:18,821
- My legs don't work.

178
00:16:18,841 --> 00:16:20,718
- Relax and take a deep breath.

179
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,611
In the name of the wind and water within, unbind her.

180
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:29,862
Stand up!

181
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,116
Don't breathe while we're on the bridge.

182
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,943
One tiny breath will break my spell.

183
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:21,486
We don't want anyone to see you.

184
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,212
I'm scared.

185
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,881
Be calm.

186
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,051
Welcome, your presence honors us.

187
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,386
Greetings, welcome.

188
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:37,296
- I've finished my rounds.

189
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:38,881
- Welcome back, sir.

190
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,851
Take a deep breath.

191
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,103
Hold it.

192
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:02,946
Welcome back.

193
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:04,781
We've been waiting for you.

194
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,877
Just a little further.

195
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,379
Master Haku!

196
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,757
Where have you...

197
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,968
A human?

198
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,096
Run!

199
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,948
Master Haku, Master Haku!

200
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:38,377
I smell something.

201
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:39,690
A human intruder!

202
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:40,942
I smell humans!

203
00:18:40,962 --> 00:18:42,067
The stench of humans!

204
00:18:42,214 --> 00:18:43,528
- They know you're here.

205
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:44,862
- Sorry, I messed up.

206
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,166
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

207
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:48,700
Now listen.

208
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,909
I'll tell you what to do.

209
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,671
If you stay here, they'll find you.

210
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,633
I'll distract them while you get away.

211
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:56,958
No, don't go!

212
00:18:56,978 --> 00:18:58,167
Stay with me, please.

213
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,848
You have no choice, if you want to survive here...

214
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,683
and save your parents, too.

215
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:06,029
So I wasn't dreaming.

216
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:07,342
They did turn into pigs.

217
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,938
Listen carefully.

218
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,317
After I'm gone, go through the back gate.

219
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,320
Take the stairs all the way down.

220
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,573
You'll find the boiler room where...

221
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,199
they stoke the fires.

222
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,661
Look for Kamaji.

223
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,163
Kamaji?

224
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,624
Ask him for work.

225
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,418
If he refuses, keep asking.

226
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,422
If you don't work, Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

227
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,048
Yubaba?

228
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,926
She's the sorceress who rules our world.

229
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,471
She'll try to trick you into leaving...

230
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,182
but keep asking for work.

231
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:46,820
The work's hard, but it will protect you.

232
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,134
Then even Yubaba can't harm you.

233
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,191
Master Haku, Master Haku!

234
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,609
I have to go.

235
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:56,831
- Remember I'm your friend, Chihiro.

236
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:58,937
- How did you know my name?

237
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,449
You told me long ago.

238
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,701
My name is Haku.

239
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,414
Here I am!

240
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,627
Master Haku, Yubaba's waiting.

241
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,755
I know, I've been searching too.

242
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,796
Um...

243
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,007
Excuse me.

244
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,182
Um...

245
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,232
Are you Kamaji?

246
00:24:53,043 --> 00:24:54,858
Haku sent me.

247
00:24:54,878 --> 00:24:56,693
Please let me work here.

248
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:04,543
What, all at once?

249
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,463
Get to work, you little runts!

250
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,928
I am Kamaji, slave to the boilers that heat the baths.

251
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,222
Step on it, boys!

252
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,475
Please let me work here.

253
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:21,718
I've got all the help I need.

254
00:25:21,738 --> 00:25:23,845
There's soot everywhere.

255
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,899
I'll never run out of help.

256
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,332
Oh, I'm sorry.

257
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,088
Wait a second.

258
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,434
Out of the way.

259
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,740
Wait, what do I do with this?

260
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,123
Do I leave it here?

261
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,626
Finish what you start.

262
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,156
Get to work, runts!

263
00:28:10,176 --> 00:28:12,053
Wanna turn back into soot?

264
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:14,057
And you, better watch it.

265
00:28:14,077 --> 00:28:15,892
You can't just take someone's work.

266
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,571
If they don't work, their spell will be broken.

267
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:21,251
There's no work for you here.

268
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:22,814
Try somewhere else.

269
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,336
You sootballs got a problem?

270
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,963
Get to work!

271
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,632
Chow time!

272
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,343
What, you guys at it again?

273
00:28:43,273 --> 00:28:44,712
Give it a rest.

274
00:28:44,732 --> 00:28:46,171
Where's your bowl?

275
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,143
I keep telling you to leave it out.

276
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:50,656
Food's here.

277
00:28:50,676 --> 00:28:51,928
Break time!

278
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:08,590
The human!

279
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,653
You're gonna catch it.

280
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,999
They're having a fit about it upstairs.

281
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,002
She's my granddaughter.

282
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,587
Your granddaughter!

283
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:21,175
She says she wants work, but I don't need any help.

284
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,803
Could you take her to Yubaba for me?

285
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,764
This girl can handle herself.

286
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,089
Not a chance.

287
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:29,298
Yubaba would kill me.

288
00:29:29,444 --> 00:29:31,821
Not even for this?

289
00:29:31,841 --> 00:29:34,218
Charcoal-roasted newt, finest quality.

290
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:40,319
If you want work, you have to sign a contract with Yubaba.

291
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,654
Might as well try your luck.

292
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,230
Fine!

293
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,647
You there, follow me.

294
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,501
What about "Yes, ma'am" or "Thank you"?

295
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,002
Yes, ma'am.

296
00:29:57,138 --> 00:29:57,806
What a klutz.

297
00:29:57,826 --> 00:29:58,494
Move it!

298
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,588
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:30:02,227 --> 00:30:03,729
Leave the shoes.

300
00:30:03,749 --> 00:30:05,251
And the socks!

301
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,553
Yes'm.

302
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:13,947
Aren't you going to thank Kamaji?

303
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:15,969
He's looking out for you.

304
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,150
Thank you very much.

305
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,986
Good luck.

306
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,541
Yubaba lives on the top floor in the back.

307
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,391
Move it, will you?

308
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,272
You'll lose your nose.

309
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:24,434
- One more elevator after this.

310
00:31:24,454 --> 00:31:25,789
- Yes'm.

311
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,430
We're here.

312
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,143
Welcome, sir!

313
00:31:42,118 --> 00:31:44,308
This elevator stops here.

314
00:31:44,328 --> 00:31:46,518
Please use another one.

315
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,459
- He's following us.

316
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:11,668
- Quit gawking.

317
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,363
Here we are.

318
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,620
Your room is on the right.

319
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:40,469
- Lin?

320
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:41,616
- Yes sir!

321
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,962
Something smells.

322
00:32:45,556 --> 00:32:46,662
It's human.

323
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:47,788
You reek of human.

324
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,257
Is that so?

325
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,104
I smell it, I do.

326
00:32:51,124 --> 00:32:52,709
Smells mighty tasty, too.

327
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,722
You're hiding something.

328
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,183
Tell me the truth.

329
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,601
Maybe it's this.

330
00:33:00,071 --> 00:33:01,198
Roasted newt?

331
00:33:01,218 --> 00:33:02,345
Give it here!

332
00:33:02,532 --> 00:33:04,117
Not a chance.

333
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:05,722
The girls asked me to get it.

334
00:33:05,994 --> 00:33:07,475
I'm begging you.

335
00:33:07,495 --> 00:33:08,976
I'll settle for a leg.

336
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,990
Pull the lever to go up, sir.

337
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,347
Can't you even knock?

338
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,101
What a plain little girl.

339
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,363
Now, come.

340
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,743
I said, come!

341
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,468
Ow...

342
00:35:48,823 --> 00:35:50,241
What a racket.

343
00:35:50,261 --> 00:35:51,679
Could you be quiet?

344
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,835
Please...

345
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,337
Let me work here.

346
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,891
Stop your babbling.

347
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,311
Why do I need a weakling like you?

348
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:33,815
Besides, this is no place for humans.

349
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,319
Millions of spirits come here...

350
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:41,281
to purge themselves of toil and care.

351
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,795
Your parents, my goodness!

352
00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:45,400
They certainly had some nerve.

353
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:49,122
Gobbling our guests' food like a couple of pigs.

354
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,374
Just deserts, I'd say.

355
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:57,214
And as for you, you'll never see your world again either.

356
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,762
You'd make a lovely piglet.

357
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,973
Or perhaps a lump of coal?

358
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,358
Trembling, aren't you?

359
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,111
Still, I'm impressed you made it this far.

360
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,490
Someone must've helped you.

361
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,867
I must thank your friend.

362
00:37:26,003 --> 00:37:28,297
Just who was it, my dear?

363
00:37:28,317 --> 00:37:30,611
You can tell me.

364
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,168
Please let me work here!

365
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,836
Not that again!

366
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,380
I want to work here!

367
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:43,635
Shut your mouth!

368
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:51,059
Why on earth should I hire you?

369
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:55,480
Anyone can see you're a lazy, spoiled, stupid crybaby.

370
00:37:55,648 --> 00:38:00,652
What job would I possibly have for someone like you?

371
00:38:00,788 --> 00:38:03,708
You're wasting your time.

372
00:38:03,728 --> 00:38:06,648
I've got all the bums I need.

373
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:11,830
Or maybe I'll give you the nastiest job I've got...

374
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,999
and work you night and day...

375
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:19,045
until you breathe your very last breath!

376
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,217
Now, now.

377
00:38:33,237 --> 00:38:34,844
What's wrong, my dear?

378
00:38:35,698 --> 00:38:37,012
I'm coming.

379
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:38,346
That's a good baby.

380
00:38:38,826 --> 00:38:40,078
Are you still here?

381
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:41,350
Get out, right now.

382
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,403
I want to work here!

383
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:47,115
Keep your voice down.

384
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,910
I'll be right there, just be patient.

385
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,111
That's a good baby.

386
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,403
There, there.

387
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,791
Please give me a job!

388
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,711
All right, just pipe down.

389
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:04,591
There, there, good baby.

390
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,446
That's your contract.

391
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,449
Sign on the bottom line.

392
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,576
I'll put you to work.

393
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:35,163
But one peep out of you about anything...

394
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,749
and I'll turn you into a piglet.

395
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,502
Should I sign here?

396
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:42,369
Where else?

397
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:44,120
Quit dilly-dallying.

398
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,929
Unbelievable.

399
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,265
What a ridiculous oath I took.

400
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:59,270
I'm bound to give work to whoever asks.

401
00:40:01,617 --> 00:40:02,493
- Finished?

402
00:40:02,513 --> 00:40:03,389
- Yes.

403
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,375
- Chihiro, that's your name?

404
00:40:09,395 --> 00:40:10,480
- Yes.

405
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,451
Quite a fancy name.

406
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,672
From now on, your name is Sen.

407
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:27,039
Understand?

408
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:27,956
Sen.

409
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,677
Answer me, Sen!

410
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,262
I understand.

411
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,638
Yes ma'am?

412
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:38,926
- See to her, she's starting work today.

413
00:40:38,946 --> 00:40:41,053
- Very well.

414
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:42,939
What is your name?

415
00:40:43,993 --> 00:40:45,328
Chi...

416
00:40:45,348 --> 00:40:46,683
I mean, Sen.

417
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,154
Then follow me, Sen.

418
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:58,997
Haku, I...

419
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,999
No idle chatter.

420
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,460
Call me Master Haku.

421
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,353
I'm afraid even Yubaba can't give an order like that.

422
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,147
Humans aren't allowed here.

423
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,191
She signed the contract.

424
00:41:26,327 --> 00:41:27,412
- What!

425
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:28,517
- I'll work hard.

426
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:30,539
- Don't send her to us.

427
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,269
- She stinks to high heaven.

428
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,867
She won't stink after three days of our food.

429
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:40,205
If she doesn't measure up, do with her as you will.

430
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:43,156
Now go back to work.

431
00:41:43,176 --> 00:41:44,281
Where's Lin?

432
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,794
What, you're dumping her on me?

433
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,546
You wanted an assistant.

434
00:41:48,724 --> 00:41:50,164
That's right!

435
00:41:50,184 --> 00:41:51,624
Lin's just perfect.

436
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,134
Go, Sen.

437
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,260
Yes sir.

438
00:41:55,064 --> 00:41:56,711
What a pain.

439
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:58,378
You're gonna pay for this.

440
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,517
Off you go.

441
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,187
Come on.

442
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,531
You pulled it off!

443
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,283
You're so thick, I was worried.

444
00:42:17,711 --> 00:42:19,526
Keep your wits about you.

445
00:42:19,546 --> 00:42:21,361
If you need anything, ask me.

446
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,791
What's wrong?

447
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,794
My legs are shaking.

448
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,384
This is where we live.

449
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,762
Eat, sleep and you'll be fine.

450
00:42:40,776 --> 00:42:41,694
Your apron.

451
00:42:41,714 --> 00:42:42,632
Keep it clean.

452
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,018
Trousers.

453
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,896
You're so puny.

454
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,065
Too big.

455
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,694
Lin, are there...

456
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,778
What?

457
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,030
Are there two Hakus here?

458
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:57,940
Two of that one?

459
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,692
I sure hope not.

460
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,286
Still too big.

461
00:43:01,422 --> 00:43:02,777
He's Yubaba's apprentice.

462
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:04,152
Be careful around him.

463
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,752
Now where was that...

464
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,630
All right, here we go.

465
00:43:13,976 --> 00:43:16,020
Hey, are you okay?

466
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,084
Don't fall apart on me.

467
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,306
What's all the noise, Lin?

468
00:43:21,442 --> 00:43:22,631
New girl.

469
00:43:22,651 --> 00:43:23,840
Says she feels faint.

470
00:44:55,869 --> 00:44:57,976
Meet me at the bridge.

471
00:44:57,996 --> 00:45:00,103
I'll take you to your mother and father.

472
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,491
My shoes are gone.

473
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,424
Thank you.

474
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,327
Follow me.

475
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,956
Dad, Mom, it's me!

476
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,791
It's Sen.

477
00:47:59,511 --> 00:48:00,679
Mom!

478
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:01,867
Dad!

479
00:48:05,017 --> 00:48:05,956
Are they sick?

480
00:48:05,976 --> 00:48:06,915
Are they hurt?

481
00:48:07,102 --> 00:48:08,437
They're just sleeping.

482
00:48:08,457 --> 00:48:09,792
Their stomachs are full.

483
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,472
They don't remember they were ever human.

484
00:48:19,114 --> 00:48:20,303
Listen to me!

485
00:48:20,323 --> 00:48:21,512
I promise I'll save you.

486
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,817
Don't get too fat or they'll eat you.

487
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,702
Hide these.

488
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,956
I thought they were gone.

489
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,292
For when you go home.

490
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,759
This was a farewell card.

491
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,678
Chihiro?

492
00:48:53,106 --> 00:48:54,629
Chihiro...

493
00:48:54,649 --> 00:48:56,172
That's my name!

494
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,685
Yubaba controls us by stealing our names.

495
00:49:00,447 --> 00:49:02,470
You're Sen here.

496
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:04,513
Keep your real name a secret.

497
00:49:04,826 --> 00:49:06,370
She almost got my name.

498
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:07,934
I was turning into Sen.

499
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,031
Without your real name, you'll never find your way home.

500
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,451
I no longer remember mine.

501
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,453
Your real name?

502
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,998
But it's strange, I remember yours.

503
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,045
Better eat, you must be hungry.

504
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,713
I don't want to.

505
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:32,093
I put a spell on them to give you back your strength.

506
00:50:08,557 --> 00:50:09,850
You've had a rough time.

507
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,163
Better eat more.

508
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,356
You know the way back.

509
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:28,807
Thanks Haku.

510
00:50:28,827 --> 00:50:30,142
I promise to work hard.

511
00:52:05,132 --> 00:52:06,342
Where were you?

512
00:52:06,362 --> 00:52:07,572
I was worried.

513
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:08,916
Sorry.

514
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,052
Out of the way.

515
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,151
Come on, give it some elbow grease.

516
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,237
Starting today, you two are on the big tub.

517
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,520
What?

518
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,520
That's Frog work!

519
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:42,189
Orders from the top.

520
00:52:42,209 --> 00:52:43,731
And no shirking, either.

521
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,764
Aren't you getting wet?

522
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,478
Sen, come on!

523
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,897
Coming!

524
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,773
I'll leave this open.

525
00:53:42,729 --> 00:53:43,689
- On the big tub, Lin?

526
00:53:43,709 --> 00:53:44,669
- Stuff it.

527
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:49,883
Just look at this.

528
00:53:49,903 --> 00:53:51,468
Hasn't been scrubbed in ages.

529
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,161
The big tub is reserved for our filthiest guests.

530
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,996
It's caked with sludge.

531
00:54:11,299 --> 00:54:12,099
Lin!

532
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:12,919
Sen!

533
00:54:12,939 --> 00:54:13,739
First customers are coming.

534
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,542
All right already!

535
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,878
Man, this is pure harassment.

536
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:21,131
Go get a tag from the foreman.

537
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,341
A tag?

538
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,012
For an herbal bath.

539
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,514
Right.

540
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,267
Lin, what's a foreman?

541
00:54:35,532 --> 00:54:36,909
Something's coming.

542
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:38,306
I wonder...

543
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:51,161
Is some good-for-nothing using the rain to sneak in?

544
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,938
Absolutely not, it's too valuable to waste.

545
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,857
Good morning!

546
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,276
Feeling refreshed?

547
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,861
For Kasuga.

548
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,155
One deluxe sulfur bath.

549
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:27,751
No point standing there.

550
00:55:27,771 --> 00:55:28,981
Back to work.

551
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,868
Scrub it with your hands.

552
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,745
Good morning!

553
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:33,996
Your bare hands.

554
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,374
But she said it has to be an herbal bath.

555
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,126
You just don't get it.

556
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,211
Mugwort, right?

557
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,505
Relax and enjoy.

558
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:53,881
Foreman.

559
00:55:53,901 --> 00:55:55,215
Yes ma'am!

560
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,354
Thank you!

561
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,605
But that's not...

562
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,231
Hey you, wait!

563
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:02,232
What's the trouble?

564
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,817
Oh, nothing at all.

565
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,736
We have an intruder.

566
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:06,695
A human?

567
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:08,312
You figure it out.

568
00:56:08,332 --> 00:56:09,813
Haku's gone today.

569
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,409
Wow, you got a really good one.

570
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:15,079
This goes straight to Kamaji.

571
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,499
Water should be right up.

572
00:56:24,557 --> 00:56:25,997
Yank this for hot water.

573
00:56:26,017 --> 00:56:27,457
Go ahead, try it.

574
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,477
You're really are a klutz.

575
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,729
Look at that color.

576
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:43,148
This one has dried worm salts.

577
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,652
With water this murky, who's gonna see the sludge?

578
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,187
Yank it again when it's full.

579
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:51,604
It'll stop.

580
00:56:52,085 --> 00:56:53,733
You can let go now.

581
00:56:53,753 --> 00:56:55,401
I'll go get our breakfast.

582
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,787
Okay.

583
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,228
Ouch!

584
00:57:25,285 --> 00:57:26,599
Um...

585
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:27,933
The bath's not ready yet.

586
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,950
So many...

587
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,580
They're for me?

588
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,210
But I don't need them.

589
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,715
No, you gave me one already.

590
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,606
Madam!

591
00:58:05,742 --> 00:58:07,494
- It's a Stink Spirit.

592
00:58:07,514 --> 00:58:09,266
- Yes, and a large one, too.

593
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,153
It's headed straight for the bridge!

594
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,655
Please turn back.

595
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:16,002
Please go!

596
00:58:16,022 --> 00:58:17,649
The baths are closed for the night.

597
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,370
Please withdraw, please!

598
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:23,165
Stinky!

599
00:58:23,384 --> 00:58:25,303
That's odd.

600
00:58:25,323 --> 00:58:27,242
Stink Spirits feel different.

601
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,922
Well, now that it's here, better go greet it!

602
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:34,176
All we can do is get rid of it fast.

603
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,553
Everyone, please return to your rooms!

604
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:37,566
Please hurry.

605
00:58:37,586 --> 00:58:38,421
Terribly sorry!

606
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,518
Lin and Sen, Yubaba wants you.

607
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,435
Yes sir!

608
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,271
Pay attention, this is your debut.

609
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:49,191
Show the customer to the big tub.

610
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,194
Remember, one peep out of you and you're coal.

611
00:58:52,455 --> 00:58:53,895
- Got it?

612
00:58:53,915 --> 00:58:55,355
- It has arrived.

613
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,751
No, that's not polite!

614
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:19,263
Welgum to our bazz.

615
00:59:22,652 --> 00:59:23,612
Oh...

616
00:59:23,632 --> 00:59:24,592
Money...!

617
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:27,312
Hurry Sen, take it!

618
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:28,689
Yez ma'am.

619
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,273
Wud are you wading for?

620
00:59:39,293 --> 00:59:41,566
Show him to da bazz!

621
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,453
Diz way...

622
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,640
Sen!

623
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,439
Horrible!

624
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,482
Breakfast!

625
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,693
Open the windows, all of 'em!

626
01:00:57,914 --> 01:00:59,228
What?

627
01:00:59,248 --> 01:01:00,562
Just a minute.

628
01:01:06,214 --> 01:01:07,569
- That's really filthy.

629
01:01:07,589 --> 01:01:08,944
- It's not funny.

630
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,666
What will she do?

631
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:17,631
Ah, she's going to refill the tub.

632
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:21,718
Oh dear, she's soiling the walls with her dirty hands!

633
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:35,732
Did you give Sen new tags?

634
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,527
Never, what a waste!

635
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,446
All that precious herbal essence!

636
01:02:48,524 --> 01:02:49,630
Sen!

637
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:50,756
Sen, where are you?

638
01:02:50,902 --> 01:02:52,007
- Lin!

639
01:02:52,027 --> 01:02:53,132
- Are you okay?

640
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,937
I asked Kamaji to help us out.

641
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,565
He's sending his best herbal essence.

642
01:02:58,993 --> 01:03:00,578
Thanks.

643
01:03:00,598 --> 01:03:02,183
There's a thorn or something stuck in him.

644
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,320
A thorn?

645
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,071
I can't pull it out.

646
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:06,605
A thorn?

647
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:07,897
Hmm...

648
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,036
Get everyone downstairs!

649
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:11,953
Hurry!

650
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,000
Sen and Lin!

651
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,586
Our guest is no Stink Spirit.

652
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,256
Use this rope.

653
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,466
Yes ma'am!

654
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,726
Tie it good and tight!

655
01:03:36,322 --> 01:03:38,116
Hurry up!

656
01:03:38,136 --> 01:03:39,930
Girls, lend a hand!

657
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,942
It's tied!

658
01:03:43,162 --> 01:03:44,831
Everyone ready?

659
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:46,520
All together now!

660
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,449
Heave!

661
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,952
And heave!

662
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:56,706
Heave!

663
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:05,465
A bicycle?

664
01:04:06,102 --> 01:04:07,770
I knew it.

665
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:09,458
Now, heave!

666
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,222
Heave!

667
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:46,423
Sen, are you all right?

668
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,394
Well done.

669
01:05:28,809 --> 01:05:29,873
Gold!

670
01:05:29,893 --> 01:05:30,957
It's gold!

671
01:05:31,145 --> 01:05:32,417
Hands off!

672
01:05:32,437 --> 01:05:33,709
That's company property.

673
01:05:33,856 --> 01:05:35,566
Quiet!

674
01:05:35,586 --> 01:05:37,296
Our guest is still with us.

675
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:44,659
Sen, you're in the way.

676
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:46,139
Get down from there.

677
01:05:46,327 --> 01:05:47,557
Open the main gates!

678
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:48,807
He's leaving!

679
01:06:15,564 --> 01:06:17,608
Sen, you're a wonder!

680
01:06:17,628 --> 01:06:19,672
You made us a fortune.

681
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,978
That was the guardian of a great river.

682
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,771
Everyone, learn from Sen!

683
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,357
Sake on the house tonight.

684
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:30,527
Now hand over all that gold you picked up.

685
01:06:44,176 --> 01:06:45,156
Want some?

686
01:06:45,176 --> 01:06:46,156
I swiped them.

687
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,044
Thanks.

688
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:50,380
What a day.

689
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:54,300
Haku missed the whole thing.

690
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,302
Not Haku again!

691
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,597
Sometimes he just disappears.

692
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:03,810
They say Yubaba makes him do bad stuff.

693
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:04,728
Really?

694
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,271
Lights out, Lin.

695
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,439
Okay.

696
01:07:32,641 --> 01:07:33,956
There's a town.

697
01:07:33,976 --> 01:07:35,291
And the water's like an ocean.

698
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,470
What did you expect after all that rain?

699
01:07:40,316 --> 01:07:42,298
I'm gonna get there someday.

700
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:44,300
I'll get out of here for sure.

701
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,126
What's wrong?

702
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:41,199
Gold!

703
01:08:44,046 --> 01:08:45,527
Who are you?

704
01:08:45,547 --> 01:08:47,028
You're no customer.

705
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:48,915
You're not allowed in there.

706
01:08:55,349 --> 01:08:57,017
Hey, it's gold!

707
01:08:57,037 --> 01:08:58,705
For me?

708
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:06,349
You can make gold?

709
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:12,856
Gimme!

710
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:22,782
Who's down here?

711
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,202
It's way past lights out.

712
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:33,042
Hey boss, I'm hungry.

713
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,210
Starved, in fact.

714
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:35,253
That voice...

715
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:37,297
There, I'll pay you now.

716
01:09:38,058 --> 01:09:39,351
I'm a customer.

717
01:09:39,371 --> 01:09:40,664
I want a bath.

718
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:42,427
Wake everyone up!

719
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:51,227
Mom and Dad, the river guardian gave me this medicine.

720
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:54,272
If you take it, you'll be people again.

721
01:09:58,402 --> 01:10:00,403
Dad, Mom, where are you?

722
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:02,030
Daddy!

723
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,292
What an awful dream.

724
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,086
Lin?

725
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:22,800
Where is everybody?

726
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:32,101
Wow, it really did turn into an ocean!

727
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:40,360
I can see where Mom and Dad are from here.

728
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,032
Kamaji lit the fires already.

729
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,076
Did I sleep that long?

730
01:10:51,757 --> 01:10:53,238
The customer's waiting.

731
01:10:53,258 --> 01:10:54,739
Can't you work faster?

732
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:58,878
Serve everything you've got, even leftovers!

733
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:01,756
Sen!

734
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:02,882
Lin?

735
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,843
I was just coming to wake you up, look!

736
01:11:06,105 --> 01:11:07,210
Gold!

737
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:08,335
He gave me real gold.

738
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,723
We've got a real high roller.

739
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:13,226
Please, sir, try this!

740
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,983
Throw us some gold!

741
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:25,321
I'm starving, bring it all!

742
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,244
Who's this guest?

743
01:11:31,547 --> 01:11:33,215
Come on, Yubaba's still asleep.

744
01:11:33,235 --> 01:11:34,903
Now's your chance.

745
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,250
I'm going to see Kamaji.

746
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:40,003
I wouldn't go there now.

747
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,338
He's angry because they woke him up.

748
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:44,340
Lin, let's go back for more.

749
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:12,869
What if I can't recognize my parents?

750
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:16,456
I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

751
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:46,235
That's the dragon I saw.

752
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:48,237
It's coming this way.

753
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:52,283
Those aren't birds!

754
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,224
Haku, don't give up.

755
01:13:05,244 --> 01:13:06,788
Over here!

756
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,467
Haku!

757
01:13:28,862 --> 01:13:30,029
It's just paper.

758
01:13:58,318 --> 01:13:59,382
Haku?

759
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:00,466
It is you, isn't it?

760
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:08,287
Are you hurt?

761
01:14:08,307 --> 01:14:09,934
Those paper birds are gone.

762
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,362
You're safe now.

763
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,294
He's going to Yubaba.

764
01:14:26,889 --> 01:14:28,099
What should I do?

765
01:14:28,119 --> 01:14:29,329
He'll die!

766
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:41,559
Now the richest man in the whole wide world...

767
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:45,938
has come to grace us with his presence.

768
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,900
Greetings!

769
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:52,361
Now let us appeal to his generosity.

770
01:14:52,664 --> 01:14:53,666
Please, sir!

771
01:14:53,686 --> 01:14:54,688
Over here.

772
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,327
I hope I get some.

773
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,454
They say gold springs from his palms.

774
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:05,374
Toss some this way, sir!

775
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:10,755
What are you doing?

776
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:11,839
Going upstairs.

777
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:12,977
No you don't.

778
01:15:12,997 --> 01:15:13,999
What's this?

779
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:15,968
Blood!

780
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,141
Out of the way, we have a guest.

781
01:15:23,727 --> 01:15:25,520
Thank you for your help.

782
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,314
Get out of the way!

783
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:51,921
I don't need it.

784
01:15:54,841 --> 01:15:57,176
I'm busy, please excuse me.

785
01:16:08,824 --> 01:16:10,242
Quiet!

786
01:16:10,262 --> 01:16:11,680
Quiet down.

787
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,026
Back, get back!

788
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:16,571
Please excuse her manners.

789
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:20,241
The girl is new and a human.

790
01:16:22,796 --> 01:16:24,068
What's so funny?

791
01:16:24,088 --> 01:16:25,360
Wipe off that smile.

792
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:26,956
Why, I would never...

793
01:16:31,878 --> 01:16:34,255
He ate them!

794
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,426
Yubaba!

795
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:17,918
We're in a fine mess now.

796
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:20,629
He's a No Face.

797
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:22,757
That's right, a No Face!

798
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:25,968
Your greed attracted quite a guest.

799
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:29,722
Don't do anything stupid until I get down there.

800
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,683
Just look at this carpet.

801
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:35,060
Get Haku out of here.

802
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:37,062
He's useless to me now.

803
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:02,630
Bo, sleeping outside your crib again?

804
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:10,679
Oh I'm sorry, you were sleeping like such a good baby.

805
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:13,766
Baba still has work to do.

806
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:19,480
Go back to sleep now, that's a good baby.

807
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,426
Ouch, let me go!

808
01:20:49,886 --> 01:20:51,720
Oh, thanks for helping me.

809
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:55,140
But I'm in a hurry, please let me go.

810
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,601
You came to make me sick.

811
01:20:58,144 --> 01:21:00,729
The outside has bad germs.

812
01:21:01,616 --> 01:21:03,535
I'm a human.

813
01:21:03,555 --> 01:21:05,474
Maybe you never saw one before.

814
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:08,028
You'll get sick out there.

815
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:10,239
Stay here and play with me.

816
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:11,949
Are you sick?

817
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:14,910
I'm in here 'cause I'll get sick outside.

818
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:17,496
Staying inside will make you sick!

819
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:21,375
You see, someone I really care about is badly hurt.

820
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:23,127
I've got to go right now.

821
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,628
Please let me go.

822
01:21:24,848 --> 01:21:27,392
If you go, I'll start crying.

823
01:21:27,412 --> 01:21:29,956
Then Baba will come and kill you.

824
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,844
I'll break your little arm.

825
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,095
You're hurting me!

826
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:35,764
Please, I'll come play with you later.

827
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:37,516
No, I wanna play now!

828
01:21:41,531 --> 01:21:42,234
Blood!

829
01:21:42,254 --> 01:21:42,957
See?

830
01:21:42,977 --> 01:21:43,680
It's blood!

831
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:56,785
Haku!

832
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,204
Go away!

833
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:00,414
It's you, isn't it?

834
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:01,957
Hang on!

835
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:03,375
Be quiet!

836
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:04,627
Haku!

837
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:11,383
Go away!

838
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:15,387
No!

839
01:22:30,497 --> 01:22:32,353
I'm not afraid of blood.

840
01:22:32,373 --> 01:22:34,229
I'll cry if you don't play.

841
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:36,241
Please be a good boy and wait.

842
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:39,662
If you don't play with me I'll cry...

843
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,040
Please, wait!

844
01:22:43,176 --> 01:22:44,803
What a racket.

845
01:22:44,823 --> 01:22:46,450
Simmer down.

846
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:50,172
You're a little butterball, aren't you?

847
01:22:58,014 --> 01:23:00,224
I am a bit transparent here.

848
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,183
Baba...

849
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:05,771
Oh dear, can't you even tell me from your own mother?

850
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:16,865
There, that gives you a little more freedom.

851
01:23:17,002 --> 01:23:18,629
Let's see now.

852
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:20,276
What shall we turn you into?

853
01:23:38,314 --> 01:23:39,649
This is our little secret.

854
01:23:39,669 --> 01:23:41,004
If you tell anyone...

855
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:43,183
I'll do the same to you.

856
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:45,894
Who are you?

857
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:48,439
Yubaba's older twin sister.

858
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:52,359
Thanks to you I've had a nice tour of the place.

859
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:54,445
Now hand over the dragon.

860
01:23:54,706 --> 01:23:55,874
What are you going to do?

861
01:23:55,894 --> 01:23:57,062
He needs help.

862
01:23:57,417 --> 01:23:58,960
That dragon's a thief.

863
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,523
He works for my sister.

864
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:03,704
He stole a valuable seal from my house.

865
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,196
Haku would never do that.

866
01:24:05,216 --> 01:24:06,572
He's too kind.

867
01:24:07,093 --> 01:24:08,845
All dragons are kind.

868
01:24:08,865 --> 01:24:10,617
Kind and stupid...

869
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:15,340
and eager to learn my sister's magical ways.

870
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:19,344
This boy will do anything that greedy woman wants.

871
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,680
Now step aside.

872
01:24:21,806 --> 01:24:24,266
It's too late for him anyway.

873
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:27,561
The thing he stole had a protection spell.

874
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:29,813
Now the thief will die.

875
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:32,274
No, don't!

876
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,784
What are you up to now?

877
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,234
All right, that's enough.

878
01:24:43,254 --> 01:24:44,568
Back to your room.

879
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:54,296
Oh dear, that was careless...

880
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:56,173
Haku, no!

881
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:18,779
Haku!

882
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:48,392
What is this?

883
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:49,977
Hold on there!

884
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:54,231
Haku!

885
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:59,278
Does it hurt?

886
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:05,033
This is serious.

887
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,287
Haku, don't give up.

888
01:26:08,423 --> 01:26:09,299
What can we do?

889
01:26:09,319 --> 01:26:10,195
He'll die!

890
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:13,417
Something inside him is eating him up.

891
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:14,626
Inside him?

892
01:26:14,762 --> 01:26:16,410
It's a strong spell.

893
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:18,078
There's nothing I can do.

894
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:21,675
Haku, the river guardian gave me this.

895
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:23,969
Eat it, maybe it will help.

896
01:26:26,222 --> 01:26:28,473
Haku, open your mouth.

897
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,310
Please Haku, eat it.

898
01:26:33,062 --> 01:26:34,855
See, it's safe.

899
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:37,232
Is it some kind of medicine?

900
01:26:37,493 --> 01:26:38,995
Open your mouth.

901
01:26:39,015 --> 01:26:40,517
You can do it.

902
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,074
That's it.

903
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,618
Swallow it.

904
01:27:06,022 --> 01:27:06,690
He spit something out.

905
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:07,378
That's it!

906
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:21,318
The seal!

907
01:27:21,496 --> 01:27:22,087
It's getting away.

908
01:27:22,107 --> 01:27:22,698
There!

909
01:27:22,718 --> 01:27:23,309
Over there!

910
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:45,717
Sen, we have to purge the spell.

911
01:27:49,889 --> 01:27:50,806
Begone!

912
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,725
Haku took this from Yubaba's sister.

913
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:55,384
From Zeniba?

914
01:27:55,404 --> 01:27:56,718
That's a witch's seal.

915
01:27:57,146 --> 01:27:59,273
Precious loot, I'd say.

916
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:03,777
I knew it was Haku.

917
01:28:03,903 --> 01:28:05,487
Kamaji, it's Haku!

918
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:08,657
Haku!

919
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,325
Haku, Haku!

920
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:14,621
Kamaji, he's not breathing.

921
01:28:14,747 --> 01:28:18,333
He is, but he's still very ill from the spell.

922
01:28:27,593 --> 01:28:30,595
That should calm him some.

923
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:37,894
Haku turned up one day, just like you.

924
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:40,856
He said he wanted to learn magic.

925
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:43,150
I tried to warn him.

926
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:46,945
Becoming a sorcerer's apprentice is dangerous business.

927
01:28:47,457 --> 01:28:48,646
But he wouldn't listen.

928
01:28:48,666 --> 01:28:49,855
He kept saying...

929
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:51,742
that he'd lost his home.

930
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:55,412
So he signed up to be Yubaba's apprentice.

931
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:58,999
He got paler and paler as time went by...

932
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:02,044
and got a sharp gleam in his eye.

933
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:08,091
Kamaji, I'm going to give this back to Zeniba.

934
01:29:08,217 --> 01:29:11,928
Give it back, apologize, and ask her to help Haku.

935
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:13,972
Tell me how to get there.

936
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:16,725
To Zeniba's house?

937
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:19,061
That's one scary sorceress.

938
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:19,978
Please.

939
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:22,221
Haku helped me.

940
01:29:22,241 --> 01:29:24,223
Now I want to help him.

941
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:29,071
Well, getting there is one thing.

942
01:29:29,238 --> 01:29:31,156
Getting back's the problem.

943
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:33,241
Wait a minute.

944
01:29:35,661 --> 01:29:38,997
Let's see now, they're here somewhere...

945
01:29:39,665 --> 01:29:42,751
Everyone, I need my shoes and clothes.

946
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,585
Sen!

947
01:29:52,605 --> 01:29:54,086
I've been hunting for you everywhere!

948
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:57,766
Lin...

949
01:29:57,902 --> 01:29:59,216
Haku?

950
01:29:59,236 --> 01:30:00,550
What happened here?

951
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:02,270
Who are those guys?

952
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:04,815
My new friends.

953
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:05,649
Right?

954
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:07,475
Yubaba's looking for you.

955
01:30:07,495 --> 01:30:09,060
She's hopping mad.

956
01:30:09,278 --> 01:30:12,906
That big tipper turned out to be a No Face.

957
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:15,784
Yubaba says you let him in.

958
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:20,455
She might be right.

959
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:22,624
What, are you serious?

960
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:24,418
I thought he was a customer.

961
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:27,712
He's already swallowed three of our people!

962
01:30:28,141 --> 01:30:29,622
Found them.

963
01:30:29,642 --> 01:30:31,123
Here they are, Sen.

964
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:33,176
We're busy, gramps.

965
01:30:33,302 --> 01:30:34,886
You can use these.

966
01:30:36,315 --> 01:30:37,692
Train tickets?

967
01:30:37,712 --> 01:30:39,089
Where'd you get those?

968
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:41,685
Leftovers from 40 years ago.

969
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:45,564
You get off at the sixth stop, called Swamp Bottom.

970
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:46,898
Swamp Bottom?

971
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:48,942
That's right, the sixth stop.

972
01:30:49,068 --> 01:30:50,068
Six.

973
01:30:50,455 --> 01:30:52,227
Make sure you get it right.

974
01:30:52,247 --> 01:30:54,019
There used to be a return train...

975
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:55,991
but these days it's one way only.

976
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,826
Still want to go?

977
01:30:57,952 --> 01:31:01,163
Yes, I'll walk back along the tracks.

978
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:04,624
What about Yubaba?

979
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:06,001
I'll talk to her now.

980
01:31:06,846 --> 01:31:08,723
Haku, I promise I'll be back.

981
01:31:08,743 --> 01:31:10,620
Please don't die.

982
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:12,924
What's going on here?

983
01:31:13,519 --> 01:31:14,729
Don't you understand?

984
01:31:14,749 --> 01:31:15,959
It's love.

985
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:26,188
It just keeps getting bigger!

986
01:31:26,365 --> 01:31:27,658
- Don't let it eat me!

987
01:31:27,678 --> 01:31:28,971
- Here she comes.

988
01:31:36,532 --> 01:31:37,991
Thank goodness, Sen!

989
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:40,327
Yubaba can't control him.

990
01:31:43,549 --> 01:31:45,447
There's no need to get upset.

991
01:31:45,467 --> 01:31:47,365
Sen will be here soon.

992
01:31:47,803 --> 01:31:49,034
Where's Sen?

993
01:31:49,054 --> 01:31:50,285
I want Sen!

994
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,255
Now hurry!

995
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:59,513
Yubaba, it's Sen.

996
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:01,014
Where were you?

997
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:03,340
Sen is here, honored guest.

998
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,550
She'll be right with you.

999
01:32:06,614 --> 01:32:08,157
What took you so long?

1000
01:32:08,177 --> 01:32:09,720
This is a total disaster!

1001
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:12,734
Win him over and take all his gold.

1002
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:18,949
What's this filthy rat?

1003
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:23,161
Don't you recognize him?

1004
01:32:23,422 --> 01:32:24,778
Of course not.

1005
01:32:24,798 --> 01:32:26,154
How disgusting.

1006
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:27,749
Now in you go.

1007
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:31,503
Have a nice time.

1008
01:32:32,421 --> 01:32:34,673
Will she be all right?

1009
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:36,758
Want to take her place?

1010
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,448
Try this, it's yummy.

1011
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:04,568
Want some gold?

1012
01:33:04,588 --> 01:33:06,820
I've decided it's just for you.

1013
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:12,586
Come over here.

1014
01:33:12,722 --> 01:33:14,515
What do you want?

1015
01:33:14,535 --> 01:33:16,328
You can tell me.

1016
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:18,592
Where did you come from?

1017
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:21,094
There's someplace I have to go right away.

1018
01:33:23,472 --> 01:33:25,932
You should go home.

1019
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:29,102
You can't give me what I want.

1020
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:32,471
Where's your home?

1021
01:33:32,491 --> 01:33:33,972
You must have a mom and dad.

1022
01:33:34,827 --> 01:33:36,454
No...

1023
01:33:36,474 --> 01:33:38,101
No...

1024
01:33:39,081 --> 01:33:40,938
I'm lonely...

1025
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:42,815
So lonely...

1026
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:45,160
Are you lost?

1027
01:33:45,546 --> 01:33:47,298
Sen...

1028
01:33:47,318 --> 01:33:49,070
I want Sen.

1029
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:50,832
Take the gold.

1030
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:52,500
Would you eat me?

1031
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:53,460
Take it.

1032
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:54,461
Take it!

1033
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:06,431
Before you eat me, eat this first.

1034
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:11,061
I was saving it for my parents, but you can have it.

1035
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:33,291
Sen!

1036
01:34:35,763 --> 01:34:37,620
You little wench!

1037
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,497
What did you feed me?

1038
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,106
Watch out!

1039
01:34:57,274 --> 01:34:59,109
Not in my house!

1040
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,957
I'm over here!

1041
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,084
Here!

1042
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:02,505
You'll pay for this!

1043
01:36:19,982 --> 01:36:22,025
Sen, down here!

1044
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:40,627
Over here!

1045
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:42,420
We don't need him.

1046
01:36:46,435 --> 01:36:48,167
He needs to get out of there.

1047
01:36:48,187 --> 01:36:49,919
It's bad for him.

1048
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:52,180
But where do we take him?

1049
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:53,306
I don't know.

1050
01:36:53,432 --> 01:36:54,849
Don't know?

1051
01:36:55,309 --> 01:36:57,936
Great, now he's following us.

1052
01:37:15,464 --> 01:37:16,486
- From here you walk.

1053
01:37:16,506 --> 01:37:17,528
- Okay.

1054
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:19,374
You'll find the station.

1055
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:20,959
Thanks.

1056
01:37:21,585 --> 01:37:23,211
Be sure to come back!

1057
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:24,420
I will.

1058
01:37:28,602 --> 01:37:30,312
Sen!

1059
01:37:30,332 --> 01:37:32,042
I said you were a klutz.

1060
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:33,721
I take it back!

1061
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:46,109
No Face, hurt her and you'll get it from me!

1062
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:50,738
There it is.

1063
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:04,669
The train's coming, let's hurry.

1064
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:30,403
To Swamp Bottom, please.

1065
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:38,661
You want to come too?

1066
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:42,165
One more, please.

1067
01:39:22,706 --> 01:39:24,040
Sit down.

1068
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:26,334
Behave yourself, okay?

1069
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:29,957
Kamaji.

1070
01:41:32,346 --> 01:41:33,618
Oh, Haku.

1071
01:41:33,638 --> 01:41:34,910
You're awake.

1072
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,589
Kamaji, where's Sen?

1073
01:41:37,017 --> 01:41:38,289
What happened?

1074
01:41:38,309 --> 01:41:39,581
Please tell me.

1075
01:41:39,843 --> 01:41:42,720
Don't you remember anything?

1076
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:45,389
Just fragments.

1077
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:48,684
Chihiro kept calling my name in the darkness.

1078
01:41:48,977 --> 01:41:52,980
I followed her voice and woke up here.

1079
01:41:53,367 --> 01:41:55,786
Chihiro?

1080
01:41:55,806 --> 01:41:58,225
So her name is Chihiro.

1081
01:41:59,498 --> 01:42:00,916
Wonderful...

1082
01:42:00,936 --> 01:42:02,354
It's the power of love.

1083
01:42:06,036 --> 01:42:09,122
This gold will hardly cover the damage.

1084
01:42:09,258 --> 01:42:10,697
That fool, Sen!

1085
01:42:10,717 --> 01:42:12,156
She just cost me a fortune.

1086
01:42:12,668 --> 01:42:16,337
But we were saved, thanks to her.

1087
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:17,630
Silence!

1088
01:42:17,756 --> 01:42:20,174
She started the whole thing.

1089
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,593
Now she's run away.

1090
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:25,388
Abandoned her own parents!

1091
01:42:26,066 --> 01:42:27,964
They must be fat enough.

1092
01:42:27,984 --> 01:42:29,882
Turn them into bacon or ham.

1093
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:31,853
No, wait.

1094
01:42:33,021 --> 01:42:34,147
Master Haku!

1095
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:36,524
What, you're still alive?

1096
01:42:38,912 --> 01:42:40,581
You still don't see it?

1097
01:42:40,601 --> 01:42:42,270
She's played a trick on you.

1098
01:42:42,739 --> 01:42:45,533
You've gotten pretty fresh.

1099
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:48,161
Since when do you talk that way?

1100
01:43:39,796 --> 01:43:41,756
Bo?

1101
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:49,388
Bo!

1102
01:43:49,514 --> 01:43:50,514
Pebbles!

1103
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:53,434
Bo!

1104
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:57,772
Where are you, Bo?

1105
01:43:58,106 --> 01:44:00,733
Please come out.

1106
01:44:01,443 --> 01:44:02,735
Bo!

1107
01:44:05,989 --> 01:44:08,282
Bo?

1108
01:44:13,121 --> 01:44:17,458
Why, you little...

1109
01:44:18,919 --> 01:44:22,046
Out with it!

1110
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:27,635
Where did you hide my Bo?

1111
01:44:28,136 --> 01:44:29,929
He's with Zeniba.

1112
01:44:30,055 --> 01:44:32,014
Zeniba?

1113
01:44:53,046 --> 01:44:54,861
Now I understand.

1114
01:44:54,881 --> 01:44:56,696
That evil witch.

1115
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:59,542
She thinks she's beaten me.

1116
01:45:01,211 --> 01:45:03,462
So, what's your plan?

1117
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:06,007
I'll bring him back.

1118
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:10,386
But you must send Sen and her parents back to their world.

1119
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:12,972
And what about you?

1120
01:45:13,223 --> 01:45:16,976
Maybe I'll send them back and then tear you to pieces.

1121
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,566
I think this is right.

1122
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:08,027
Come on.

1123
01:46:34,846 --> 01:46:36,514
You can ride on my shoulder.

1124
01:47:55,177 --> 01:47:56,594
Come in.

1125
01:48:01,766 --> 01:48:03,559
Thank you.

1126
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,938
Well, hurry up then.

1127
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:09,732
Come on.

1128
01:48:13,028 --> 01:48:14,862
So you all made it.

1129
01:48:14,998 --> 01:48:16,187
- I...

1130
01:48:16,207 --> 01:48:17,396
- Have a seat.

1131
01:48:17,532 --> 01:48:19,783
I'll make some tea.

1132
01:48:25,634 --> 01:48:27,741
Zeniba, Haku stole this.

1133
01:48:27,761 --> 01:48:29,868
I came to give it back.

1134
01:48:33,131 --> 01:48:35,591
Do you know what this is?

1135
01:48:35,884 --> 01:48:38,802
No, but I know it's very precious.

1136
01:48:38,939 --> 01:48:40,732
I'm here to apologize for him.

1137
01:48:40,752 --> 01:48:42,545
He's sorry.

1138
01:48:43,433 --> 01:48:46,477
You held this and nothing happened to you?

1139
01:48:46,603 --> 01:48:47,520
What?

1140
01:48:47,646 --> 01:48:50,439
Wait, the protection spell is gone.

1141
01:48:51,576 --> 01:48:53,141
I'm sorry.

1142
01:48:53,161 --> 01:48:54,726
There was this strange bug.

1143
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:56,695
I squashed it.

1144
01:48:57,239 --> 01:48:59,365
Squashed it!

1145
01:49:01,409 --> 01:49:04,745
My sister snuck that bug into the dragon...

1146
01:49:04,871 --> 01:49:07,540
so she could control him.

1147
01:49:07,666 --> 01:49:10,292
And you squashed it!

1148
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,630
Now then, sit down.

1149
01:49:14,808 --> 01:49:16,289
You must be No Face.

1150
01:49:16,309 --> 01:49:17,790
You sit, too.

1151
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:22,429
Please turn them back into themselves.

1152
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:25,599
Why my dear, the spell's long broken.

1153
01:49:25,767 --> 01:49:28,143
They can change back any time.

1154
01:49:35,443 --> 01:49:39,280
Yubaba and I are two halves of a whole, but we don't get along.

1155
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:41,949
You know what bad taste she has.

1156
01:49:42,117 --> 01:49:45,160
Sorceress twins are just a recipe for trouble.

1157
01:49:49,207 --> 01:49:53,669
I'd like to help you dear, but there's nothing I can do.

1158
01:49:53,795 --> 01:49:55,838
It's one of our rules here.

1159
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:59,300
You'll have to save your parents and your dragon boyfriend...

1160
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:01,051
all by yourself.

1161
01:50:01,177 --> 01:50:04,096
But can't you even give me a hint?

1162
01:50:04,472 --> 01:50:07,933
I feel like Haku and I met a long time ago.

1163
01:50:08,101 --> 01:50:10,102
In that case it's easy.

1164
01:50:10,395 --> 01:50:12,938
Everything that happens stays inside you...

1165
01:50:13,064 --> 01:50:15,316
even if you can't remember it.

1166
01:50:16,661 --> 01:50:18,309
It's already late.

1167
01:50:18,329 --> 01:50:19,977
Why don't you stay the night?

1168
01:50:20,405 --> 01:50:23,198
You boys give me a hand.

1169
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:31,332
Come on, keep at it.

1170
01:50:34,346 --> 01:50:35,576
See?

1171
01:50:35,596 --> 01:50:36,826
You have a talent for this.

1172
01:50:37,005 --> 01:50:38,631
You're a big help.

1173
01:50:39,424 --> 01:50:42,676
It's not the same when you use magic.

1174
01:50:44,022 --> 01:50:46,170
Pull it through there.

1175
01:50:46,190 --> 01:50:48,338
Now do it again.

1176
01:50:48,558 --> 01:50:51,185
Zeniba, I'm going back after all.

1177
01:50:51,853 --> 01:50:55,314
Haku could die while I'm sitting here.

1178
01:50:55,523 --> 01:50:59,026
And they might eat my mom and dad!

1179
01:51:01,196 --> 01:51:03,947
Wait just a little longer.

1180
01:51:04,074 --> 01:51:05,616
There we are.

1181
01:51:06,451 --> 01:51:08,410
Use it to tie back your hair.

1182
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:14,500
It's pretty.

1183
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:17,160
It'll protect you.

1184
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:19,621
I made it from the thread we spun.

1185
01:51:19,881 --> 01:51:21,173
Thank you.

1186
01:51:30,735 --> 01:51:32,612
What good timing.

1187
01:51:32,632 --> 01:51:34,509
We've got another guest, let him in.

1188
01:51:34,646 --> 01:51:35,771
Sure.

1189
01:51:49,077 --> 01:51:50,202
Haku!

1190
01:51:51,413 --> 01:51:52,579
Haku...

1191
01:51:53,415 --> 01:51:54,998
I'm so glad to see you.

1192
01:51:55,343 --> 01:51:56,553
Are you okay?

1193
01:51:56,573 --> 01:51:57,783
Do you feel all right?

1194
01:51:58,086 --> 01:51:59,086
Thank goodness.

1195
01:52:00,922 --> 01:52:03,173
Good timing, I'd say.

1196
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:06,301
Zeniba, Haku's alive.

1197
01:52:06,845 --> 01:52:10,973
Haku, I no longer blame you for what you did.

1198
01:52:11,099 --> 01:52:14,476
But be sure to protect this girl.

1199
01:52:14,769 --> 01:52:17,771
Okay boys, time you went home.

1200
01:52:17,897 --> 01:52:19,940
Come see me again soon.

1201
01:52:20,692 --> 01:52:25,028
You stay with me and be my helper.

1202
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:28,490
Zeniba!

1203
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:31,285
Thank you, I'm going now.

1204
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:34,455
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll manage just fine.

1205
01:52:34,622 --> 01:52:37,833
My real name is Chihiro.

1206
01:52:37,969 --> 01:52:39,200
Chihiro?

1207
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:40,451
What a nice name.

1208
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:42,463
Take good care of it.

1209
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:43,255
I will!

1210
01:52:43,381 --> 01:52:45,174
Now off you go.

1211
01:52:46,895 --> 01:52:48,417
Thank you, Zeniba.

1212
01:52:48,437 --> 01:52:49,959
Goodbye!

1213
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:40,521
Haku, listen.

1214
01:53:40,855 --> 01:53:44,483
I don't remember this, but my mom told me about it.

1215
01:53:44,859 --> 01:53:48,487
Once when I was little, I fell in a river.

1216
01:53:48,957 --> 01:53:50,750
Now it's all built over.

1217
01:53:50,770 --> 01:53:52,563
It flows underground.

1218
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:55,077
But I just remembered.

1219
01:53:56,204 --> 01:53:57,871
The river was called...

1220
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:01,416
it was called the Kohaku River.

1221
01:54:02,043 --> 01:54:05,045
Your real name is Kohaku.

1222
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:28,110
Chihiro, thank you!

1223
01:54:28,236 --> 01:54:31,488
My name is Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

1224
01:54:31,916 --> 01:54:33,501
- Nigihayami?

1225
01:54:33,521 --> 01:54:35,106
- Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

1226
01:54:35,295 --> 01:54:36,630
What a name!

1227
01:54:36,650 --> 01:54:37,985
Sounds like a guardian spirit.

1228
01:54:38,329 --> 01:54:42,749
I remember how you fell into me as a child.

1229
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:44,585
You were chasing your shoe.

1230
01:54:44,794 --> 01:54:49,131
Yes, and you carried me to shallow water.

1231
01:54:50,008 --> 01:54:51,258
I'm so happy...

1232
01:55:24,042 --> 01:55:25,459
They're back!

1233
01:55:38,806 --> 01:55:41,433
You brought Bo back with you?

1234
01:55:44,312 --> 01:55:45,228
Baba!

1235
01:55:45,365 --> 01:55:46,818
Bo!

1236
01:55:46,838 --> 01:55:48,291
You're not hurt?

1237
01:55:48,311 --> 01:55:49,764
What a terrible time you had.

1238
01:55:51,027 --> 01:55:54,154
Bo, when did you learn to stand on your own?

1239
01:55:54,739 --> 01:55:56,657
Yubaba, remember your promise.

1240
01:55:56,908 --> 01:55:59,910
Send Chihiro and her parents back to their world.

1241
01:56:00,328 --> 01:56:02,746
Sorry, but it's not that simple.

1242
01:56:02,872 --> 01:56:05,999
This world has rules, you know.

1243
01:56:06,626 --> 01:56:07,793
Silence!

1244
01:56:07,929 --> 01:56:09,222
Just do it, Baba.

1245
01:56:09,242 --> 01:56:10,535
Don't be so mean.

1246
01:56:10,838 --> 01:56:13,423
Baby had such a good time.

1247
01:56:13,925 --> 01:56:16,677
But I'm just following the rule.

1248
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:19,179
Otherwise I can't break the spell.

1249
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:22,557
If you make Sen cry, I won't like you anymore.

1250
01:56:22,850 --> 01:56:24,184
But...

1251
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:25,477
Granny!

1252
01:56:25,687 --> 01:56:27,062
Granny?

1253
01:56:27,397 --> 01:56:29,022
I'll do as you ask.

1254
01:56:40,868 --> 01:56:42,995
Haku told me about the rule.

1255
01:56:43,121 --> 01:56:44,913
Well, you've got guts.

1256
01:56:45,133 --> 01:56:46,739
I brought your contract.

1257
01:56:46,759 --> 01:56:48,365
Follow me.

1258
01:56:48,543 --> 01:56:50,585
This won't take a minute, Bo.

1259
01:56:51,587 --> 01:56:53,088
Don't worry.

1260
01:56:57,552 --> 01:57:01,388
See if you can pick out your parents for me.

1261
01:57:10,732 --> 01:57:12,149
You get one guess.

1262
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:14,943
Pick them out and you all go free.

1263
01:57:26,799 --> 01:57:28,614
Granny, I can't do it.

1264
01:57:28,634 --> 01:57:30,449
Dad and Mom aren't here.

1265
01:57:30,636 --> 01:57:32,409
Not here?

1266
01:57:32,429 --> 01:57:34,202
Is that your answer?

1267
01:57:35,757 --> 01:57:36,798
Yes.

1268
01:57:39,594 --> 01:57:42,888
You're right!

1269
01:57:43,066 --> 01:57:44,276
Attagirl!

1270
01:57:44,296 --> 01:57:45,506
Good for you.

1271
01:57:49,479 --> 01:57:50,645
Thank you everyone.

1272
01:57:50,782 --> 01:57:52,388
All right!

1273
01:57:52,408 --> 01:57:54,014
You win, just get out of here.

1274
01:57:54,525 --> 01:57:56,443
Thanks for everything.

1275
01:57:56,986 --> 01:57:58,487
Goodbye.

1276
01:57:58,946 --> 01:57:59,946
Thank you.

1277
01:58:00,114 --> 01:58:01,490
See you soon.

1278
01:58:01,793 --> 01:58:02,648
- Haku!

1279
01:58:02,668 --> 01:58:03,523
- Let's go.

1280
01:58:04,202 --> 01:58:05,410
Where's Mom and Dad?

1281
01:58:05,536 --> 01:58:06,828
They went on ahead.

1282
01:58:14,378 --> 01:58:15,462
The water's gone.

1283
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:17,380
I can't go any further.

1284
01:58:17,799 --> 01:58:20,133
Go back the way you came.

1285
01:58:20,301 --> 01:58:23,386
But don't look back until you're out of the tunnel.

1286
01:58:23,554 --> 01:58:25,639
But what about you?

1287
01:58:26,057 --> 01:58:28,809
I'll tell Yubaba I'm quitting my apprenticeship.

1288
01:58:28,986 --> 01:58:30,238
I'm fine now.

1289
01:58:30,258 --> 01:58:31,510
I have my name back.

1290
01:58:32,063 --> 01:58:33,855
Now I can go home too.

1291
01:58:33,981 --> 01:58:35,315
Will we meet again somewhere?

1292
01:58:35,493 --> 01:58:36,223
- I'm sure of it.

1293
01:58:36,243 --> 01:58:36,973
- Promise?

1294
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:37,943
Promise.

1295
01:58:38,069 --> 01:58:40,362
Now go, and don't look back.

1296
01:59:03,427 --> 01:59:05,011
Chihiro!

1297
01:59:05,356 --> 01:59:06,670
Where have you been?

1298
01:59:06,690 --> 01:59:08,004
Hurry up.

1299
01:59:11,529 --> 01:59:12,426
Mom!

1300
01:59:12,446 --> 01:59:13,343
Dad!

1301
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:15,188
Don't go running off like that.

1302
01:59:15,356 --> 01:59:16,356
Let's go.

1303
01:59:17,024 --> 01:59:19,234
Mom, are you really okay?

1304
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:23,613
Hurry, the moving van will be there.

1305
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:35,250
Hurry up, Chihiro.

1306
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:45,719
Watch your step.

1307
01:59:45,855 --> 01:59:47,503
Chihiro, don't cling.

1308
01:59:47,523 --> 01:59:49,171
You'll make me trip.

1309
02:00:01,402 --> 02:00:02,861
The end of the tunnel.

1310
02:00:03,237 --> 02:00:04,487
Hey!

1311
02:00:04,822 --> 02:00:06,198
What is it?

1312
02:00:06,782 --> 02:00:08,909
Will you look at that.
