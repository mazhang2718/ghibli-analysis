1
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,727
Shh!

2
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,694
Sosuke, come right back up, OK?

3
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,862
OK!

4
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:44,858
Huh?

5
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,006
A goldfish!

6
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,811
Can't get it out.

7
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,580
That was weird.

8
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,092
Ow!

9
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,930
It looks kind of dead.

10
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:01,967
It licked me!

11
00:10:01,987 --> 00:10:02,927
It's alive!

12
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,108
Sosuke, we'll be late!

13
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,860
Mom, a goldfish!

14
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,070
Sosuke!

15
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,957
This wind is crazy.

16
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,127
Sosuke, I'm starting the car now!

17
00:10:35,478 --> 00:10:36,334
Well?

18
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:37,210
Have you found my daughter?

19
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:44,196
What?

20
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:45,969
She was captured by a human?

21
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:50,035
A boy!

22
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:51,724
This is very bad.

23
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,637
Is it already dead?

24
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,314
You are alive!

25
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,452
Sosuke, I have a job, you know!

26
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,663
Look, Mom, I found a goldfish!

27
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:47,634
- A goldfish?

28
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:49,531
- It was right down by the rocks.

29
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:54,005
Yeah?

30
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,135
Hm?

31
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,197
I don't know who you are, but we don't use weedkiller around here.

32
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,938
Hm?

33
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,606
What?

34
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:24,274
This is not weedkiller.

35
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,664
This is the purest ocean water, and it keeps me from drying out on land.

36
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:29,301
Whatever.

37
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:30,865
As long as it's not weedkiller.

38
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:31,991
- Excuse us.

39
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:33,033
- Please wait.

40
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,009
Uh-oh.

41
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:41,209
This is bad.

42
00:12:41,229 --> 00:12:42,335
This is very bad.

43
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:45,588
Wow.

44
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:46,380
That guy was a freak show.

45
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,186
But don't you call people "freak show." We never judge others by their looks.

46
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,010
I know, Mom.

47
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,760
I don't.

48
00:12:51,864 --> 00:12:52,803
- Oh.

49
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:53,762
Another experiment for school?

50
00:12:53,782 --> 00:12:54,721
- Mm-hm.

51
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,859
Your teacher doesn't really like show and tell.

52
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,486
I think it'll be fine.

53
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,530
Don't worry, I'll take good care of you.

54
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:01,604
Huh!

55
00:13:01,624 --> 00:13:02,605
She sure is pretty.

56
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,957
There's a ship headed for dry dock.

57
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:13,595
Hurry up.

58
00:13:13,615 --> 00:13:14,617
Eat your breakfast.

59
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,548
I wonder if she would eat this.

60
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,758
Want some?

61
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:23,313
Hey!

62
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,585
My cut is all gone!

63
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,143
Mom, I think I'll call her Ponyo.

64
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:31,238
- Mmm?

65
00:13:31,258 --> 00:13:32,260
- She came to me.

66
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,105
She might be magic.

67
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:36,013
I saved her.

68
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:37,848
She's my responsibility now.

69
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,495
Want ham instead?

70
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,888
Mom, Ponyo really likes to eat ham.

71
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,598
So she thinks she's human?

72
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,935
Ouch!

73
00:14:31,756 --> 00:14:32,695
Whoa!

74
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:33,654
Turn!

75
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,960
Humans are disgusting!

76
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,879
Come on, Lisa, hurry!

77
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,933
All this waste, filth.

78
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,770
Morning, Shima-san!

79
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:02,934
Ponyo, look.

80
00:15:02,954 --> 00:15:04,436
You can see our house.

81
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:26,770
- Ask about the fish.

82
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,834
- I will.

83
00:15:27,937 --> 00:15:29,356
- Love you, Sosuke.

84
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:30,795
- Goodbye.

85
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:32,171
Morning!

86
00:15:32,191 --> 00:15:33,464
Seems like I'm always late.

87
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:34,674
- Can you get me another wheelchair?

88
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:35,800
- Sure.

89
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:52,420
- Good morning, Sosuke.

90
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,817
- Excuse me.

91
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:55,382
- I'm in a big hurry, Yoshie.

92
00:15:55,402 --> 00:15:56,863
- Is that so?

93
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:58,058
- And me, Sosuke?

94
00:15:58,078 --> 00:15:59,170
- Not now, Toki.

95
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,282
I'm concentrating.

96
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:10,761
Ah… Maybe the teacher will get mad.

97
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,764
I got it.

98
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,093
You'll be safe here, Ponyo.

99
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:20,636
I'll be back soon.

100
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:24,494
Hm.

101
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:26,266
I wonder if there are any cats around here.

102
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:37,125
That should do it, Ponyo.

103
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:38,348
Stay put.

104
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:39,571
I'll be right back.

105
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:48,998
- See you later.

106
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:50,958
- Hello there, Toshi.

107
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,596
I'll call if her cough gets worse, but she looks fine.

108
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:54,517
- You good, little sweetie?

109
00:16:54,537 --> 00:16:55,365
- Oh, thank you.

110
00:16:55,385 --> 00:16:56,213
Good.

111
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:57,799
- Bye-bye.

112
00:16:57,819 --> 00:16:59,301
- Good morning, sensei.

113
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:00,948
- Good morning, Sosuke.

114
00:17:00,968 --> 00:17:02,513
- Hi, Sosuke.

115
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,851
- Sosuke!

116
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:09,602
- Kumiko!

117
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:10,895
Look at me!

118
00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:12,105
My mother made me a new dress.

119
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,294
- Isn't it pretty?

120
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:16,400
- Hm… Hey, Sosuke, let's go play.

121
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:17,380
Can't now.

122
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,276
I'm busy.

123
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:19,257
You're not busy.

124
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:20,153
You're five.

125
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:21,475
- I am too!

126
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:22,712
I have a job.

127
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:23,949
- You're so weird.

128
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:25,180
Yeah.

129
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,327
Hm!

130
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,892
Oh!

131
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,854
Ponyo?

132
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,858
Ponyo!

133
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,826
Sosuke!

134
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:58,109
- Oh, Kumiko.

135
00:17:58,129 --> 00:17:59,319
- What is that?

136
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,872
There are rules about bringing things to school for a reason.

137
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:03,093
I know.

138
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:03,990
This isn't school.

139
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,460
These bushes are on the senior center property.

140
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,837
Let me see!

141
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,214
Oh, a goldfish?

142
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:11,580
She's not just a goldfish.

143
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,872
She's Ponyo.

144
00:18:12,977 --> 00:18:14,104
Ponyo?

145
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:15,251
Let's see!

146
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,013
OK, but don't tell she's here.

147
00:18:17,106 --> 00:18:19,005
- I won't.

148
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:20,924
- The rules are: look but don't touch.

149
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:22,049
Look at her.

150
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:23,091
Isn't she pretty?

151
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:33,821
That's the most boring goldfish I've ever seen in my entire life.

152
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,511
That one was Kumiko's fault.

153
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,348
You should never judge others by their looks.

154
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,895
Let's get you some more water.

155
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,085
Ponyo!

156
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:35,143
Ah!

157
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:37,124
That was my fault.

158
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,809
There it comes again.

159
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,062
I hear old Sosuke's voice.

160
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,274
But I know our boy is in school right now.

161
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,569
So it must be only in my head.

162
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:56,748
Look, Yoshie.

163
00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:57,853
I'm right over here.

164
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,784
Oh, that's a relief.

165
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,245
I haven't lost my mind quite yet.

166
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,497
Are you ready to see my big surprise?

167
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,009
- What is it?

168
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:09,448
- I'll show you.

169
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,086
But first, guess what color she is.

170
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,370
- Hm… She… She's red!

171
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,581
- Red!

172
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,300
That's right!

173
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:20,960
- How did you both guess that?

174
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,712
- Come on, show us!

175
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,473
OK.

176
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:28,509
- Well, look!

177
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:29,969
- Very pretty.

178
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:31,199
Her name is Ponyo.

179
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:32,346
She likes to eat ham.

180
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,984
And she can do magic!

181
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:39,488
I got a cut on my thumb, and it went away because she licked it.

182
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,490
Oh!

183
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:45,411
Maybe she could use some of her magic to fix my hips and back.

184
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,498
I'd let a fish lick me if it'd get me out of this wheelchair.

185
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,626
Well, I don't know about all that licking.

186
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,046
- I'd have to ask Ponyo… - Let me have a look in that green pail.

187
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,423
Yes, Toki-san.

188
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,970
It has a real face on it!

189
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:04,962
Hurry up!

190
00:21:04,982 --> 00:21:06,255
Put it back in the ocean.

191
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,548
Don't you realize it'll cause a tsunami?

192
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:09,133
Oh, you.

193
00:21:09,153 --> 00:21:10,635
It's always tsunami, day and night.

194
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:14,523
Fish with faces who come out of the sea cause tsunamis.

195
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,650
That's what they always say.

196
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:19,797
Tsunami!

197
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:20,826
Tsunami!

198
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:21,855
It's here!

199
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:23,744
Ah!

200
00:21:23,764 --> 00:21:25,551
Oh!

201
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:27,358
Sosuke, put her back in the ocean where she belongs!

202
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,708
Toki, what's the matter?

203
00:21:32,802 --> 00:21:33,929
I'm soaking wet.

204
00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:35,076
Look at my clothes!

205
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,762
Sosuke!

206
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,519
Sosuke!

207
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,981
Sosuke!

208
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,527
Sosuke!

209
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,321
Come back here and apologize!

210
00:22:11,173 --> 00:22:13,113
Don't worry, Ponyo.

211
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:15,073
No matter what, I will protect you.

212
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,919
I promise.

213
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,295
Sosuke!

214
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,425
Sosuke!

215
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,806
Ponyo!

216
00:22:31,193 --> 00:22:32,362
Ponyo.

217
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:33,551
Sosuke.

218
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:38,190
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

219
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,573
I will love you, too.

220
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:50,286
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

221
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,069
Ponyo?

222
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,243
Ponyo!

223
00:23:31,337 --> 00:23:33,298
Ponyo!

224
00:23:33,318 --> 00:23:35,279
Ponyo!

225
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,373
Ponyo!

226
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:39,408
Ah!

227
00:23:39,428 --> 00:23:40,242
Ponyo!

228
00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:41,076
Ponyo!

229
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:43,662
- Ponyo!

230
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:44,579
- Sosuke!

231
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:47,708
Ponyo!

232
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:49,168
Ponyo!

233
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,013
Ponyo!

234
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,015
Ponyo!

235
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,060
Ponyo!

236
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,741
Listen, Sosuke, you know, this could be for the best.

237
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,202
I know you tried, but Ponyo is a fish.

238
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:57,090
She wasn't meant to live in a bucket.

239
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,905
The ocean is home to her.

240
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,249
Anyway, let's get home.

241
00:25:00,342 --> 00:25:02,470
Hopefully, that spritzing weirdo is gone.

242
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,618
Whoo!

243
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,630
Can I have a lick?

244
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,591
Hurry, it's starting to melt.

245
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:13,002
Dad's favorite.

246
00:25:13,022 --> 00:25:14,003
Me, too!

247
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,614
I'm really sorry, Sosuke.

248
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:22,429
But Dad is finally coming home tonight.

249
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,357
You can tell him all about Ponyo.

250
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:54,210
- No more ocean today, OK?

251
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,879
- Mm-hm.

252
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,208
Sosuke?

253
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:25,303
Sosuke?

254
00:26:25,323 --> 00:26:26,325
Time to come in now.

255
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:31,340
Maybe if I leave the pail, Ponyo will know where we live when she comes back.

256
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:33,123
Do that.

257
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:34,833
I think that's a lovely thing to do for Ponyo.

258
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,762
Mm-hm.

259
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,692
Sosuke, can you get that?

260
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,195
It must be your dad.

261
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:56,049
Hello?

262
00:26:56,069 --> 00:26:57,036
Yep.

263
00:26:57,056 --> 00:26:58,023
She's fine.

264
00:26:58,127 --> 00:26:59,581
- Are you at the dock?

265
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:01,055
- I caught a second run, so I have to take it.

266
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:02,529
I won't be home tonight.

267
00:27:02,631 --> 00:27:03,904
I'll signal you when we pass.

268
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:05,197
Can you help me out with Mom?

269
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,043
No, you should tell her.

270
00:27:09,304 --> 00:27:10,494
Hi, honey.

271
00:27:10,514 --> 00:27:11,704
Uh-huh.

272
00:27:11,807 --> 00:27:13,122
What?!

273
00:27:13,142 --> 00:27:14,457
Too many in a row, Koichi!

274
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,884
Let someone else take it!

275
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,096
Go ahead, abandon your wife and child up here on a cliff all alone.

276
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,098
Oh, jerk!

277
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:26,079
Uh!

278
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:27,233
Come on, Sosuke.

279
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:28,387
Let's get out of here.

280
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,316
What if Ponyo comes back?

281
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,319
Mm!

282
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,200
Ah!

283
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:01,232
There's Dad.

284
00:28:01,252 --> 00:28:02,629
Turn off the lights, Mom.

285
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:04,110
- Don't you wanna signal him?

286
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,507
- Mm-mm.

287
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,584
Hey, my son is working the signal all by himself!

288
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:32,221
- Can you believe that?

289
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:33,785
- Your wife must be pretty mad.

290
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:40,260
S… O… R… …R…Y.

291
00:28:40,354 --> 00:28:43,055
- Dad says he's very sorry.

292
00:28:43,075 --> 00:28:45,776
- B-U-G… - O-F-F.

293
00:28:45,796 --> 00:28:48,497
- B… B-U-G O-F-F.

294
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:51,218
B-U-G O-F-F.

295
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,529
Mom, Dad says he loves you.

296
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:03,116
He says, "Lots and lots."

297
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,995
Wow!

298
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:18,580
Nice, Dad!

299
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,500
Don't cry, Mom.

300
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,129
I know Dad breaks his promises sometimes.

301
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,715
But he does his best for us.

302
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,676
I promised Ponyo I'd take care of her.

303
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,678
Then I lost her.

304
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,474
I wonder if she's crying now.

305
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:13,413
- Ah!

306
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:14,484
- You are so good!

307
00:30:14,504 --> 00:30:15,555
Mmm!

308
00:30:17,617 --> 00:30:19,683
♪ Happy as can be ♪ - Mm!

309
00:30:19,703 --> 00:30:21,769
Ah!

310
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:23,855
- Don't you worry, Sosuke.

311
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,784
You did your best and Ponyo will be just fine.

312
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,953
OK.

313
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,331
I say we start with dessert and go backwards!

314
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,041
It's been a backwards kind of day.

315
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,678
It's not your fault.

316
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,098
I exposed you to the magic and you're too young to understand.

317
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:52,194
I have to keep the sea in balance.

318
00:30:52,214 --> 00:30:54,216
It's a great responsibility.

319
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:56,762
You must promise me something: You will never go back to the surface.

320
00:30:56,782 --> 00:30:59,223
Yes?

321
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:00,828
Come on, now.

322
00:31:00,848 --> 00:31:02,350
Eat, Brunhilde.

323
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,030
I want ham!

324
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:08,371
Ham!

325
00:31:08,391 --> 00:31:09,553
You ate their food.

326
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:10,735
What else did you do?

327
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,454
Did you taste blood, Brunhilde?

328
00:31:12,547 --> 00:31:14,321
My name is not Brunhilde.

329
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:16,115
It's Ponyo.

330
00:31:16,218 --> 00:31:17,769
- Ponyo?

331
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:19,340
- Ponyo!

332
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,911
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

333
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,924
I will be a human, too!

334
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:25,644
Human?

335
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:27,291
What do you know about humans, Brunhilde?

336
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,762
They spoil the sea.

337
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,307
They treat your home like their empty, black souls.

338
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:36,061
I was once, long ago, a human myself.

339
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,313
I had to leave that all behind to serve the Earth.

340
00:31:38,407 --> 00:31:39,930
Hands!

341
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,473
I want hands!

342
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,111
I don't want these flippers anymore!

343
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:48,031
I want feet, like Sosuke!

344
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:52,077
That's enough!

345
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,501
Ah!

346
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,503
Oh!

347
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,946
I made hands!

348
00:32:09,966 --> 00:32:11,142
I made feet, too!

349
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,338
Ha!

350
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:13,283
- Yes!

351
00:32:13,303 --> 00:32:14,145
- What?

352
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,007
No, no!

353
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,300
Don't tell me.

354
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,510
You have tasted human blood!

355
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,229
I'm going to Sosuke!

356
00:32:19,322 --> 00:32:20,262
Enough!

357
00:32:20,282 --> 00:32:21,222
You're making a terrible mistake!

358
00:32:21,324 --> 00:32:21,982
Don't do it!

359
00:32:22,002 --> 00:32:22,660
Stop it.

360
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,338
Stop it!

361
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,016
Stop changing now.

362
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,006
Revert.

363
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:25,913
Revert.

364
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:26,820
Revert!

365
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,727
Revert!

366
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,198
Revert!

367
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:34,035
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!

368
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:38,206
Don't change!

369
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,376
I need more power!

370
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,536
Let me out!

371
00:32:44,556 --> 00:32:45,912
Let me out!

372
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:49,926
Let me out!

373
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,439
I want to see Sosuke!

374
00:32:51,459 --> 00:32:52,878
Let me go!

375
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,974
Let me out!

376
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,810
You can't be human and magic at the same time, sweetheart.

377
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,897
Be still, be still, be still, be still, be still.

378
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,991
She's already so powerful.

379
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,993
Just like her mother.

380
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,668
If you could only remain innocent and pure forever.

381
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,526
I don't have the power to hold her for very long.

382
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,903
I need to ask for her mother's help now.

383
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,029
I… What?

384
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:00,654
Huh!

385
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:01,906
They're headed for my elixirs.

386
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:02,603
Shoo!

387
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,218
Shoo!

388
00:34:03,238 --> 00:34:03,833
Get out of here!

389
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:04,448
Shoo!

390
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,962
That was too close.

391
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,257
I must be careful not to upset the balance of nature.

392
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,352
Calm.

393
00:34:11,372 --> 00:34:12,374
I must remain calm.

394
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,387
When I think of leaving her again, my heart won't stop pounding.

395
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,607
Right, then.

396
00:34:16,627 --> 00:34:17,754
Focus on work.

397
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,558
This batch should be ready.

398
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,485
At least there aren't leaks down here.

399
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,243
This door still doesn't fit right.

400
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,540
I'll fix that next.

401
00:34:49,764 --> 00:35:06,219
If even one living creature got in here… Ah, yes.

402
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:22,694
I can feel the power of the ocean in the furthest reaches of my DNA.

403
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:27,626
When this well is full, then the age of the ocean will begin again.

404
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,712
An explosion of life to match the Cambrian age.

405
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,174
An end to the era of those abominable humans.

406
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,847
This cursed door!

407
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,974
Teeth!

408
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,401
Let's find Sosuke!

409
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:27,991
I'm free!

410
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,939
- Waterspout!

411
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:50,378
- Captain, look over there!

412
00:39:53,151 --> 00:39:55,320
- It must be a tsunami!

413
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,509
- Turn the ship into the wave!

414
00:39:57,614 --> 00:39:59,158
Look!

415
00:39:59,178 --> 00:40:00,722
What is that?

416
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,781
Captain, all our instruments just went dead!

417
00:40:12,253 --> 00:40:14,068
It's a little girl.

418
00:40:14,088 --> 00:40:15,903
Looks like she's about Sosuke's age.

419
00:40:29,437 --> 00:40:30,696
- Thanks again.

420
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:31,975
- Sure.

421
00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:33,254
See you tomorrow.

422
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,849
It's raining so hard, Sosuke.

423
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,893
I'll call your mother and have her pick you up.

424
00:40:36,986 --> 00:40:37,953
That's all right.

425
00:40:37,973 --> 00:40:38,940
I'll take the shortcut.

426
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,927
Goodbye, sensei.

427
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:42,075
Bye, Sosuke.

428
00:40:42,095 --> 00:40:44,139
Be careful out there.

429
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,277
Sosuke, I'm sorry.

430
00:41:28,371 --> 00:41:29,790
The door didn't open, right?

431
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,229
The power just went out.

432
00:41:31,332 --> 00:41:32,229
- Everything OK at school?

433
00:41:32,249 --> 00:41:33,146
- Mm-hm.

434
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:36,744
Lisa, if your shift's over, you can go home.

435
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,121
Sure you don't need my help?

436
00:41:38,214 --> 00:41:39,549
Don't worry.

437
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:40,904
We'll be fine.

438
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,876
A little rain storm keeps the seniors entertained.

439
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,255
If I were you, I'd get out of here while you still can.

440
00:41:47,348 --> 00:41:48,558
Wait here, sweetie.

441
00:41:48,578 --> 00:41:49,788
I'll be right back.

442
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,426
OK.

443
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,855
Hi, Yoshie.

444
00:42:03,948 --> 00:42:05,242
Oh, Sosuke.

445
00:42:05,262 --> 00:42:06,556
Is that you?

446
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,651
It's so dark I can barely see.

447
00:42:08,745 --> 00:42:10,143
Here, Yoshie.

448
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:11,561
I made this for you.

449
00:42:13,249 --> 00:42:14,856
Oh!

450
00:42:14,876 --> 00:42:16,483
What do we have here?

451
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,286
There's one for you, too, Noriko.

452
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,079
Thank you, Sosuke.

453
00:42:20,173 --> 00:42:22,050
I can't see a thing.

454
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,947
I don't know why we're still here.

455
00:42:24,052 --> 00:42:26,701
It's just a little rain.

456
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:29,370
I wanna go back to my own house.

457
00:42:31,976 --> 00:42:33,082
There we go.

458
00:42:33,102 --> 00:42:34,208
That's more like it.

459
00:42:34,312 --> 00:42:35,710
Let's see.

460
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,128
Your goldfish!

461
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:41,476
I bet the lights came back on because Sosuke's here.

462
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,645
They're now calling the bizarre event a micro-typhoon.

463
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:50,193
Ship… Ah, this stupid TV.

464
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,820
Nobody understands weather anymore.

465
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,448
Might as well look at shadows and listen to crickets.

466
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,492
You should take your mother home now.

467
00:42:57,585 --> 00:43:00,610
With our lucky goldfish to keep us company, - we'll be just fine.

468
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,655
- OK.

469
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:07,043
…landslides, flooding and tidal surges.

470
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:13,925
People trying to evacuate… This is for you, Toki.

471
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:18,141
I can't tell.

472
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:19,323
What is it?

473
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:20,505
It's wrinkled.

474
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,599
It goes like this.

475
00:43:24,195 --> 00:43:25,260
I got it.

476
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,345
It's a grasshopper.

477
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,439
No, it's the Koganei Maru.

478
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:31,526
That's the name of your father's ship, isn't it, Sosuke?

479
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,121
- Mm-hm.

480
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:34,643
- Now, it looks like a party hat.

481
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,198
Sosuke, we've gotta get on the road.

482
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,908
Let's hurry now and say goodbye.

483
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:41,171
OK.

484
00:43:41,191 --> 00:43:43,361
Ladies, good evening.

485
00:43:43,464 --> 00:43:44,758
Good evening, Mr.

486
00:43:44,778 --> 00:43:46,072
Sosuke.

487
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,751
Be careful the wind doesn't blow you away.

488
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,597
Let's go.

489
00:43:50,617 --> 00:43:51,494
Slide in.

490
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:58,136
They said the phones are out, too.

491
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,494
The ocean looks all puffed up.

492
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,126
You think the storm could sink the ships?

493
00:44:30,219 --> 00:44:31,103
No.

494
00:44:31,123 --> 00:44:32,007
Ships can handle a storm.

495
00:44:32,027 --> 00:44:32,911
They go out to sea.

496
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,922
That's what your father's doing right now.

497
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,529
I saw a fish!

498
00:44:47,549 --> 00:44:48,759
Did you see that, Mom?

499
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,104
Put your seatbelt on!

500
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:01,981
Hold on, Lisa!

501
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:03,107
You can't cross here!

502
00:45:03,211 --> 00:45:04,567
We've just gotten word.

503
00:45:04,587 --> 00:45:05,943
They're gonna evacuate this side.

504
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,455
It's not mandatory.

505
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,332
There are some people up at the senior center.

506
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,583
You should get them out.

507
00:45:10,676 --> 00:45:11,573
They're fine.

508
00:45:11,593 --> 00:45:12,490
They're on the leeward side.

509
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,629
You need to go back and seek shelter there.

510
00:45:14,722 --> 00:45:16,391
OK.

511
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:18,080
But right now, I need to get home.

512
00:45:18,184 --> 00:45:19,499
- Well, you can't cross here.

513
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:20,834
- Take the mountain road.

514
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,816
- Hold on, kiddo.

515
00:45:24,836 --> 00:45:25,712
- Mm!

516
00:45:27,068 --> 00:45:27,562
No!

517
00:45:27,582 --> 00:45:28,076
Stop!

518
00:45:28,096 --> 00:45:28,590
Don't do it!

519
00:45:28,694 --> 00:45:29,237
Watch out!

520
00:45:29,257 --> 00:45:29,800
Here it comes!

521
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:38,569
Lisa, you gotta get out of here!

522
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,540
Hold on.

523
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,028
The fish are following us now!

524
00:46:21,122 --> 00:46:21,852
Turn around.

525
00:46:21,872 --> 00:46:22,602
Sit down.

526
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,499
Ah!

527
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,583
Ah!

528
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:38,004
Try to hang on to something!

529
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,932
That wave is just after us.

530
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,413
- Mom, the little girl just fell in!

531
00:47:43,433 --> 00:47:44,476
- What?

532
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,322
She was running on a fish and she fell!

533
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,079
Where?

534
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,464
I've never seen the ocean like this.

535
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,633
Sosuke, where did you see a little girl?

536
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,469
She was out there, running on top of a huge fish!

537
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,762
That's impossible.

538
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:15,726
Sosuke, we have to go!

539
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:32,692
It's OK.

540
00:48:32,712 --> 00:48:33,819
There was no little girl out there.

541
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,079
We're almost home.

542
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:30,833
There is a little girl.

543
00:49:30,853 --> 00:49:32,376
Come over here!

544
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,502
We'll help you!

545
00:49:33,522 --> 00:49:34,544
Come here!

546
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,764
Stay there, Sosuke.

547
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,648
What?

548
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,126
Sosuke, do you know her?

549
00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:27,083
- Ponyo?

550
00:50:27,103 --> 00:50:28,487
- Mm-hm!

551
00:50:28,507 --> 00:50:29,891
It's me, Ponyo!

552
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,447
It is you!

553
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:35,794
Mom!

554
00:50:35,814 --> 00:50:38,067
Ponyo came back and she's a little girl now!

555
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,912
Who?

556
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,631
I found Sosuke!

557
00:51:09,243 --> 00:51:11,934
All right.

558
00:51:11,954 --> 00:51:14,645
Sosuke, Ponyo, life is mysterious and amazing.

559
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,448
But we have work to do now.

560
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:19,159
And I need both of you to stay calm.

561
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,911
Me, too.

562
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:26,542
You can take off your rain coat now, Sosuke.

563
00:51:26,635 --> 00:51:28,096
I've got a job for you, Ponyo.

564
00:51:28,116 --> 00:51:29,577
Will you hold the light?

565
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:34,498
- Huh?

566
00:51:34,518 --> 00:51:36,667
- Stay here, and I'll go get a towel.

567
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:56,363
Here, this way!

568
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:59,325
Smells like you in here!

569
00:52:02,129 --> 00:52:03,214
- Ow!

570
00:52:03,234 --> 00:52:04,319
- Ponyo!

571
00:52:08,218 --> 00:52:09,179
- Oof!

572
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:10,160
- There, got ya.

573
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,338
Now, let's rub you down and dry you off.

574
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:17,728
Look at that pretty red hair.

575
00:52:17,748 --> 00:52:19,375
It's almost dry.

576
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,461
- Huh!

577
00:52:20,481 --> 00:52:21,462
- Huh?

578
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,098
And your clothes are dry.

579
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,060
That's because Ponyo was a fish, Mom.

580
00:52:26,153 --> 00:52:28,281
- Water can't make her wet.

581
00:52:28,301 --> 00:52:30,429
- Mm-hm.

582
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,108
I really like this thing.

583
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:36,612
So let's calm ourselves down with a hot drink.

584
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,490
Ponyo, will you hold the light for me?

585
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:40,564
- Coming!

586
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:41,565
- OK.

587
00:52:41,669 --> 00:52:43,109
- Who wants to bet the water is working?

588
00:52:43,129 --> 00:52:44,569
- I do!

589
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:45,829
I do!

590
00:52:48,634 --> 00:52:50,178
- Water!

591
00:52:50,198 --> 00:52:51,742
- Water!

592
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,630
We have our own water tank outside in the yard.

593
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,133
And who thinks the stove will light?

594
00:52:58,227 --> 00:52:59,542
And light!

595
00:52:59,562 --> 00:53:00,877
All right.

596
00:53:00,979 --> 00:53:02,649
- All right!

597
00:53:02,669 --> 00:53:04,339
- We have our own propane tank.

598
00:53:07,111 --> 00:53:08,217
- OK.

599
00:53:08,237 --> 00:53:09,343
Let's all sit at the table.

600
00:53:09,363 --> 00:53:10,469
- OK!

601
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,315
Ponyo, the table's over here.

602
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,197
Now, sit down like this.

603
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,035
Now, put your stuff down.

604
00:53:27,256 --> 00:53:29,030
- You need to use your hands.

605
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:30,824
- No, I'll use feet!

606
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,546
Look at that!

607
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,175
Uh… what are you guys doing?

608
00:53:40,269 --> 00:53:41,792
Look at her feet.

609
00:53:41,812 --> 00:53:43,335
They're just like hands.

610
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,075
Here you go.

611
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,910
It's hot.

612
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,625
This is the best.

613
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,643
Mm!

614
00:54:56,668 --> 00:55:04,176
Hm… That hit the spot.

615
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,221
So, what would the two of you like to do now?

616
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,181
Ponyo wants ham!

617
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,518
All she thinks about is ham, Mom.

618
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:15,270
I better make some dinner then.

619
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:18,315
First, we should start the generator so we can call Koichi.

620
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,517
That's my dad.

621
00:55:21,537 --> 00:55:23,394
We need power to talk to him on the radio.

622
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,532
He's out at sea right now, but he'll be fine.

623
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:28,085
- Is he an evil wizard?

624
00:55:28,105 --> 00:55:29,565
- No, of course not.

625
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,079
He's the captain of a ship.

626
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,540
So, Ponyo, what's your dad like?

627
00:55:34,633 --> 00:55:36,385
He hates humans!

628
00:55:36,405 --> 00:55:38,157
He keeps me in a bubble!

629
00:55:38,262 --> 00:55:39,493
- Huh?

630
00:55:39,513 --> 00:55:40,744
- So I swam away from home.

631
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,130
Huh?

632
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:44,132
So, what's your mother like then?

633
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:47,928
She's big and beautiful!

634
00:55:48,021 --> 00:55:50,024
- But she can be very scary.

635
00:55:50,044 --> 00:55:52,047
- Just like my mom.

636
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,897
Ponyo, over here, please.

637
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,997
Mm!

638
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,791
Looks like something must have gone wrong with the fuel line.

639
00:56:17,885 --> 00:56:19,492
- Maybe it's clogged.

640
00:56:19,512 --> 00:56:21,119
- It's clogged.

641
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,380
It's clogged over there.

642
00:56:38,405 --> 00:56:40,067
- It's on!

643
00:56:40,087 --> 00:56:41,749
- It's light now!

644
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:43,431
Yeah!

645
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,694
Ponyo, you're amazing.

646
00:57:02,763 --> 00:57:04,453
- Antenna, antenna!

647
00:57:04,473 --> 00:57:06,163
- Hey, Mom.

648
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,258
Did all the ships out there sink?

649
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:11,970
I don't see any lights out there.

650
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:17,976
All right.

651
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,230
- Too loud!

652
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,690
- What's wrong?

653
00:57:32,793 --> 00:57:35,025
I can't get any reception.

654
00:57:35,045 --> 00:57:37,277
That's really weird.

655
00:57:37,381 --> 00:57:39,529
Transmitting from JA4LL.

656
00:57:39,549 --> 00:57:41,697
JA4LL.

657
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,210
Come in, Koichi.

658
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,963
This is Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.

659
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,715
We wanted you to know that we're all doing fine.

660
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,469
I'm taking care of everyone, Dad!

661
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:53,762
Ham!

662
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,564
Got your noodles all ready?

663
00:58:04,658 --> 00:58:05,514
Be careful.

664
00:58:05,534 --> 00:58:06,390
It's really hot.

665
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,417
You have to wait a little bit.

666
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,044
It takes three minutes.

667
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:42,269
OK, close your eyes.

668
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,646
Keep 'em shut.

669
00:58:46,908 --> 00:58:48,515
Ponyo, uh!

670
00:58:48,535 --> 00:58:50,142
No peeking!

671
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,032
Get ready to look now.

672
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:59,870
Abracadabra!

673
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:03,832
Mm!

674
00:59:03,925 --> 00:59:05,490
- It's ham!

675
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:07,075
- Careful, it's hot.

676
00:59:07,179 --> 00:59:08,953
Oh!

677
00:59:08,973 --> 00:59:10,747
Hot, hot, hot!

678
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:30,567
Mm… Mom, Ponyo fell asleep.

679
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,993
Do you think Ponyo came from far, far away?

680
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,120
Yeah, I do.

681
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:58,897
Look outside.

682
00:59:58,917 --> 01:00:00,544
It looks like the waves have calmed down.

683
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,350
Maybe because Ponyo fell asleep.

684
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,768
Do you see that light?

685
01:00:11,785 --> 01:00:13,537
It's moving.

686
01:00:13,557 --> 01:00:15,309
There must be somebody still over there.

687
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,447
That's the senior center.

688
01:00:23,964 --> 01:00:25,257
- I don't see it now.

689
01:00:25,277 --> 01:00:26,570
- Did they evacuate?

690
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,792
I'm worried about the seniors.

691
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:33,088
Sosuke, stay with Ponyo, OK?

692
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,600
I've gotta go help them.

693
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:48,103
I can get there if I take the mountain road.

694
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,400
Sosuke, I should go to the senior center.

695
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,734
I'm coming, too.

696
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:58,029
I'd feel better if you stay up here.

697
01:00:58,123 --> 01:00:59,834
But why can't I come?

698
01:00:59,854 --> 01:01:01,565
We'll wake up Ponyo and take her with us.

699
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,827
I wanna go with you!

700
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:09,749
Sosuke, right now, our house is a beacon in the storm.

701
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:14,129
Our light can be seen by the town and by the ships, and every place else is dark.

702
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,047
You know I need to help the old people.

703
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:19,259
So I'm going to leave you here in charge.

704
01:01:19,352 --> 01:01:20,542
You'll do the right thing.

705
01:01:20,562 --> 01:01:21,752
I know it.

706
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:24,347
You have to be the man of the house tonight.

707
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,766
Let Ponyo sleep, wait for me.

708
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,436
You're only five, but you're very smart.

709
01:01:29,529 --> 01:01:31,031
Sometimes, we take a leap.

710
01:01:31,051 --> 01:01:32,553
Be brave.

711
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,357
You can do it, and I'll be back.

712
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:36,860
Promise?

713
01:01:38,371 --> 01:01:40,228
- I promise.

714
01:01:40,248 --> 01:01:42,105
- You promised.

715
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,783
I love you, Sosuke.

716
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:42,050
Captain, I can see the lights of a city up ahead.

717
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:45,220
Finally, we can get our bearings again.

718
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:48,098
We're someplace I've never seen before.

719
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,142
Did the storm blow us to China?

720
01:02:53,321 --> 01:02:54,948
What mountains are those?

721
01:02:54,968 --> 01:02:56,595
I have no idea where we are.

722
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:06,324
That is a huge wall of water.

723
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:08,868
Why is the moon so close?

724
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:15,709
Hm… That's no mountain we're looking at.

725
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,544
And that's no town, either.

726
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,337
Those lights are ships.

727
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:34,269
The moon is so close, its gravity is forcing the ocean to rise.

728
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,105
What's going on here?

729
01:03:42,329 --> 01:03:43,852
- The engine stopped!

730
01:03:43,872 --> 01:03:45,395
- Try to hold her steady.

731
01:03:45,498 --> 01:03:46,730
- Arai, drop the sea anchor.

732
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:47,982
- Yes, sir.

733
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:03,298
Something's coming this way.

734
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:32,660
I just saw the Goddess of Mercy!

735
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,037
Ah!

736
01:04:43,348 --> 01:04:44,579
- The engine's working.

737
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:45,830
- It was her.

738
01:04:45,934 --> 01:04:47,499
So you saw her, too?

739
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:49,084
I thought maybe I was hallucinating.

740
01:04:49,177 --> 01:05:22,961
Thank you for protecting us… Higher, higher.

741
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,259
Huh?!

742
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,851
That has a powerful spell on it.

743
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,228
How has she learned to do something like that?

744
01:05:57,172 --> 01:05:57,986
What?

745
01:05:58,006 --> 01:05:58,820
I can't believe it!

746
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,654
No!

747
01:05:59,757 --> 01:06:01,016
She's turned into a human!

748
01:06:01,036 --> 01:06:02,295
Whoa!

749
01:06:02,315 --> 01:06:03,574
Hold still!

750
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:07,005
You… What are you doing?

751
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:12,677
Hold still!

752
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:14,064
Girls!

753
01:06:14,084 --> 01:06:15,378
Girls… Whoa!

754
01:06:15,482 --> 01:06:16,922
Stop, stop!

755
01:06:16,942 --> 01:06:18,382
Please!

756
01:06:18,485 --> 01:06:19,059
Stop now!

757
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:19,653
No!

758
01:06:19,673 --> 01:06:20,247
Stop!

759
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:20,841
Ah!

760
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,229
Respect your father!

761
01:06:27,785 --> 01:06:29,309
This was serious.

762
01:06:29,329 --> 01:06:30,853
I'm trying to save your sister.

763
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:39,245
At last, she has finally come.

764
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:18,087
- Fujimoto.

765
01:07:18,107 --> 01:07:20,319
- It's been a long time, my love.

766
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,705
Look at my ocean.

767
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,627
Something has changed.

768
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,256
It's like my ancient Devonian Sea, full of magic and power.

769
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,967
You're going to be very upset, my dear.

770
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:37,303
Ponyo got into my elixirs, and she has tasted human blood.

771
01:07:37,397 --> 01:07:39,879
Ponyo?

772
01:07:39,899 --> 01:07:42,381
What a lovely name.

773
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,313
Hm.

774
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,315
Of course, it's all my fault, really.

775
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:54,445
She's become so powerful that she's opened a hole in the fabric of reality.

776
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:57,156
She's too young to understand, and she wouldn't listen to me.

777
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,024
She's now a little girl.

778
01:07:59,044 --> 01:08:00,818
And she loves a little boy.

779
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,954
And the whole world is out of balance.

780
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:07,500
Please, please, remove the human in her, or the planet is doomed.

781
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:10,253
Huh?

782
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:19,345
Already the Earth is pulling satellites from the sky.

783
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:25,101
And the moon pulls the sea closer… Be calm, dear.

784
01:08:32,035 --> 01:08:34,037
Sosuke.

785
01:08:34,057 --> 01:08:36,059
The boy's name is Sosuke.

786
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:43,453
We love your sister, and we all want her to be happy.

787
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:50,752
Listen, my darling, why don't we let Ponyo become human for good?

788
01:08:50,845 --> 01:08:54,516
We must test the boy.

789
01:08:54,536 --> 01:08:58,207
If Sosuke's love is true, Ponyo will be permanently transformed and the balance of nature will be restored.

790
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:02,555
But if his love isn't real, then Ponyo will turn into sea foam.

791
01:09:02,649 --> 01:09:04,693
True.

792
01:09:04,713 --> 01:09:06,757
That is where we all originated, my darling.

793
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:09,020
The boy is so young, so innocent.

794
01:09:09,113 --> 01:09:10,282
- What does…?

795
01:09:10,302 --> 01:09:11,471
- Shh.

796
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,445
Let them sleep.

797
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,447
They'll need their rest.

798
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,002
Sosuke!

799
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:38,341
Sosuke!

800
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,762
Ponyo, you OK?

801
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,890
Good morning, Sosuke.

802
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,437
Huh?

803
01:09:51,531 --> 01:09:52,866
Look at that.

804
01:09:52,886 --> 01:09:54,221
The ocean is at our door.

805
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,424
How come your mom's not here?

806
01:10:19,517 --> 01:10:21,166
The water's so high.

807
01:10:21,186 --> 01:10:22,835
She must be stuck.

808
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:24,929
Too bad we don't have a boat.

809
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,434
There's a boat, right there!

810
01:10:31,487 --> 01:10:33,031
- It's a little small.

811
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:34,595
- No, it's not.

812
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,573
Ah!

813
01:10:47,336 --> 01:10:48,860
Uh!

814
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,404
Huh?

815
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,165
Thank you!

816
01:10:53,593 --> 01:10:55,158
Wow!

817
01:10:55,178 --> 01:10:56,743
You even made the candle bigger.

818
01:10:56,846 --> 01:10:58,056
- We can fit!

819
01:10:58,076 --> 01:10:59,286
- This is fantastic.

820
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:00,663
- Fantastic!

821
01:11:00,683 --> 01:11:01,956
- You take that end, please.

822
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,301
OK!

823
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:09,974
- Ready? ' Let's Whoa!

824
01:11:10,067 --> 01:11:11,034
Whoa!

825
01:11:11,054 --> 01:11:12,021
Whoa!

826
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:13,008
Whoa!

827
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,979
Ah!

828
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:24,030
It actually floats!

829
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,326
Doesn't look like it has any leaks.

830
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,661
Now, we have to fill the boiler.

831
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,831
The water gets sucked in through this pipe.

832
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:36,834
Then it gets heated up here in this round thing.

833
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,822
Well, that worked.

834
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,664
Looks like everything's shipshape.

835
01:12:14,757 --> 01:12:15,697
- Shipshape!

836
01:12:15,717 --> 01:12:16,657
- Yep.

837
01:12:16,759 --> 01:12:17,907
- Shipshape!

838
01:12:17,927 --> 01:12:19,075
- Shipshape.

839
01:12:19,178 --> 01:12:20,013
Shipshape!

840
01:12:20,033 --> 01:12:20,868
Shipshape!

841
01:12:20,888 --> 01:12:21,723
Shipshape!

842
01:12:21,743 --> 01:12:22,578
Shipshape!

843
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:23,673
Shipshape!

844
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,363
What's that?

845
01:12:51,335 --> 01:12:52,337
- Ow!

846
01:12:52,357 --> 01:12:53,359
- Ow!

847
01:12:57,049 --> 01:12:58,406
- Look at that!

848
01:12:58,426 --> 01:12:59,783
- It's burning.

849
01:12:59,886 --> 01:13:00,700
It's hot!

850
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:01,534
It's hot!

851
01:13:01,554 --> 01:13:02,368
It's hot!

852
01:13:02,388 --> 01:13:03,202
It's hot!

853
01:13:10,688 --> 01:13:18,051
- Is it working?

854
01:13:18,071 --> 01:13:25,434
- Hm… It's working!

855
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,322
Sosuke, we're shipshape, right?

856
01:13:29,415 --> 01:13:30,020
- Yep.

857
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:30,645
- This is a good boat.

858
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:31,741
Mm-hm.

859
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,663
Ah!

860
01:13:39,175 --> 01:13:40,170
- Hey, Sosuke!

861
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:41,185
Look at me!

862
01:13:41,205 --> 01:13:42,200
- Mm-hm.

863
01:13:42,303 --> 01:13:43,660
- Hey, this is even more fun!

864
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,037
- Mm-hm.

865
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,673
That thing makes my nose hot.

866
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:50,343
Ponyo, you be the boat's lookout.

867
01:13:50,436 --> 01:13:51,862
- And I'll do the steering, OK?

868
01:13:51,882 --> 01:13:53,308
- Mm-hm.

869
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:54,754
I'm the lookout!

870
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:22,875
There's the road.

871
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,169
That's the road my mom took last night.

872
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,080
- I don't see her anywhere.

873
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,540
- We'll see her.

874
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:32,969
She promised me she'd come back.

875
01:14:37,525 --> 01:14:39,340
Those are ancient fish.

876
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,175
They lived during the Devonian Age.

877
01:14:41,278 --> 01:14:43,031
I know that one.

878
01:14:43,051 --> 01:14:44,804
It's Bothriocephalus.

879
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:50,611
- And that one is… - Dipnorhynchus.

880
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:52,405
Dipnorhynchus!

881
01:14:52,498 --> 01:14:53,833
Wow!

882
01:14:53,853 --> 01:14:55,188
That one's really huge!

883
01:14:55,292 --> 01:14:56,794
- That's Devonynchus!

884
01:14:56,814 --> 01:14:58,316
- Devonynchus!

885
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:07,336
Ahoy!

886
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,089
Ahoy!

887
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,091
- Ahoy… - Whoa, there's a boat!

888
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,844
Ahoy!

889
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:18,639
I'm gonna say that.

890
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:20,891
Ahoy!

891
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,103
Ow!

892
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,107
Whoa, that's fast!

893
01:15:30,036 --> 01:15:31,267
- Hey!

894
01:15:31,287 --> 01:15:32,518
- I'm getting the hang of this.

895
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:37,867
Get ready to stop, Ponyo.

896
01:15:44,008 --> 01:15:45,051
- Hello, you two.

897
01:15:45,071 --> 01:15:46,114
- Hello.

898
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:49,128
Hey, that is quite a boat you got there.

899
01:15:49,221 --> 01:15:50,723
I've seen you before.

900
01:15:50,743 --> 01:15:52,245
You're Lisa's little boy, aren't you?

901
01:15:52,349 --> 01:15:53,726
He's not a little boy.

902
01:15:53,746 --> 01:15:55,123
He's Sosuke!

903
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,719
She's Ponyo.

904
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,847
And I used to be a fish.

905
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,475
Is that right?

906
01:16:02,568 --> 01:16:03,444
I like your name, Ponyo.

907
01:16:03,464 --> 01:16:04,340
It's cute.

908
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:06,562
Mm-hm.

909
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,981
By the way, have you seen my mom?

910
01:16:09,075 --> 01:16:10,765
Your mother?

911
01:16:10,785 --> 01:16:12,475
Why isn't your mother with you?

912
01:16:12,578 --> 01:16:14,038
- She went to the senior center.

913
01:16:14,058 --> 01:16:15,518
- Wow, way up there?

914
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:17,448
My baby likes you.

915
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:49,021
Oh, sweetheart.

916
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,030
Oh, is that for us?

917
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,337
Can I have the cup?

918
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:19,500
Well, thank you.

919
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,210
It smells good.

920
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:25,568
Wow, that's good soup.

921
01:17:25,588 --> 01:17:27,006
Thanks.

922
01:17:27,111 --> 01:17:29,177
- My mom made it from scratch.

923
01:17:29,197 --> 01:17:31,263
- The soup's for him!

924
01:17:31,365 --> 01:17:33,201
Oh, I'm sorry.

925
01:17:33,221 --> 01:17:35,057
He's a little too young.

926
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,278
He can only drink milk at this age.

927
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:41,282
But I could eat the soup instead, and it would help me to make milk for him.

928
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:43,200
Huh?

929
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:45,786
Yeah, my mom made milk for me, too.

930
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,133
Ponyo, what do you say?

931
01:17:48,153 --> 01:17:50,406
Is it all right if I eat the soup?

932
01:17:50,509 --> 01:17:51,699
- That's fine.

933
01:17:51,719 --> 01:17:52,909
- Thank you, sweetheart.

934
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:56,672
Huh?

935
01:18:10,446 --> 01:18:12,366
People from the town!

936
01:18:12,386 --> 01:18:14,306
It's just like a parade!

937
01:18:14,408 --> 01:18:16,807
Ahoy!

938
01:18:16,827 --> 01:18:19,226
Are any of you in need of assistance at this time?

939
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:21,875
We're all good here!

940
01:18:21,895 --> 01:18:24,440
But thanks for checking on us, captain!

941
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,870
We are taking everyone to the Mountain Peak Hotel!

942
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,706
For your safety, we request that you follow us!

943
01:18:30,799 --> 01:18:32,114
Aye, aye!

944
01:18:32,134 --> 01:18:33,449
Will do!

945
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:36,962
Looks like the whole town is here.

946
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:38,130
I don't see your mom.

947
01:18:38,224 --> 01:18:39,726
- I hope she's OK.

948
01:18:39,746 --> 01:18:41,248
- Ponyo, time for us to cast off.

949
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:42,384
Hold on a second.

950
01:18:49,068 --> 01:18:50,800
- Here, have some milk.

951
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:52,552
- Oh.

952
01:18:52,572 --> 01:18:54,304
Uh… It's for milk.

953
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:57,149
She already ate all the ham off those sandwiches.

954
01:18:57,243 --> 01:18:58,683
Thank you.

955
01:18:58,703 --> 01:19:00,143
That's very generous of you, Ponyo.

956
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:01,987
Sosuke, here.

957
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:04,156
I brought you the biggest candle I have.

958
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,732
Thanks.

959
01:19:05,752 --> 01:19:07,234
Ponyo will make it bigger.

960
01:19:07,336 --> 01:19:08,630
- See you later.

961
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:09,944
- Take care.

962
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,122
Be careful.

963
01:19:15,636 --> 01:19:17,451
Oh!

964
01:19:17,471 --> 01:19:19,286
What's the matter?

965
01:19:23,519 --> 01:19:25,334
Shh, shh, shh.

966
01:19:25,354 --> 01:19:27,169
You have a cold.

967
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,115
Ponyo!

968
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:00,754
Hey, are you guys OK?

969
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:02,298
Hey, Sosuke.

970
01:20:02,391 --> 01:20:03,831
- What are you doing out here?

971
01:20:03,851 --> 01:20:05,291
- Sosuke, where's your mother?

972
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,386
She went to the senior center last night!

973
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:08,679
We're on our way to find her!

974
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:12,016
You know, I still can't believe Lisa beat that wave.

975
01:20:12,109 --> 01:20:13,736
- That's Lisa.

976
01:20:13,756 --> 01:20:15,383
- Sosuke, can I ride with you?

977
01:20:15,487 --> 01:20:16,468
I can't.

978
01:20:16,488 --> 01:20:17,469
I'm busy.

979
01:20:17,489 --> 01:20:18,470
I have a job to do now.

980
01:20:18,574 --> 01:20:20,348
Check the park.

981
01:20:20,368 --> 01:20:22,142
The seniors should be there by now.

982
01:20:22,244 --> 01:20:23,392
- Good luck, kid!

983
01:20:23,412 --> 01:20:24,560
- You'll find her!

984
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:29,199
We'll send a boat for the seniors as soon as we drop this group off!

985
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:33,162
Good luck, captain!

986
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:23,712
Ponyo, our candle is just about out.

987
01:21:26,683 --> 01:21:28,686
We'll be OK.

988
01:21:28,706 --> 01:21:30,709
The fisherman gave me another one.

989
01:21:30,813 --> 01:21:32,461
Ow!

990
01:21:32,481 --> 01:21:34,129
It's still pretty hot.

991
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:41,647
Bye-bye.

992
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:43,305
Here, Ponyo.

993
01:21:43,325 --> 01:21:44,890
Can you make this bigger?

994
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:47,861
All right.

995
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:55,869
Hey, are you OK?

996
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:57,746
Hm?

997
01:22:02,761 --> 01:22:04,118
- Ponyo.

998
01:22:04,138 --> 01:22:05,495
- Hm?

999
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:21,072
Ponyo.

1000
01:22:21,092 --> 01:22:21,885
Ponyo!

1001
01:23:19,338 --> 01:23:20,736
Oh, good.

1002
01:23:20,756 --> 01:23:22,154
I can walk from here.

1003
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:50,275
There's the road.

1004
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:04,706
It's shrinking!

1005
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:07,042
Ponyo!

1006
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:28,063
Ponyo!

1007
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,191
Ponyo, wake up!

1008
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:36,071
Sosuke.

1009
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:43,120
You scared me.

1010
01:24:43,213 --> 01:24:44,715
Don't turn into a fish again.

1011
01:24:44,735 --> 01:24:46,237
I'd miss you.

1012
01:24:58,478 --> 01:24:59,668
My mom's car!

1013
01:24:59,688 --> 01:25:00,878
Ponyo, come on!

1014
01:25:00,898 --> 01:25:02,088
She might be there!

1015
01:25:05,944 --> 01:25:07,217
Hey, Mom!

1016
01:25:07,237 --> 01:25:08,510
Mom!

1017
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,107
Mommy!

1018
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:18,530
Mommy!

1019
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,367
Mom!

1020
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:27,789
Mommy!

1021
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,336
Mom!

1022
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:36,632
Mom!

1023
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:07,746
Here, I've got your boat.

1024
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,540
There's water coming from your eyes.

1025
01:26:17,182 --> 01:26:18,809
- Let's go find your mom.

1026
01:26:18,829 --> 01:26:20,456
- Mm-hm.

1027
01:27:06,523 --> 01:27:07,963
- It's so beautiful!

1028
01:27:07,983 --> 01:27:09,423
- You forgot your cane!

1029
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:11,977
Look, here comes a whale again!

1030
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,645
I think he sees us.

1031
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:15,689
The other side is nice, isn't it?

1032
01:27:15,782 --> 01:27:17,243
- And my knees don't hurt.

1033
01:27:17,263 --> 01:27:18,724
- This is the other side?

1034
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:22,195
Where do you think we are, Las Vegas?

1035
01:27:22,289 --> 01:27:24,855
- It's like a dream.

1036
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:27,441
- Ladies, can we gather around, please?

1037
01:27:27,544 --> 01:27:29,255
- Coming!

1038
01:27:29,275 --> 01:27:30,986
- Why don't we run?

1039
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:32,831
Come on!

1040
01:27:32,924 --> 01:27:34,844
- It's so nice to run.

1041
01:27:34,864 --> 01:27:36,784
- Beat you there!

1042
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,383
Winner!

1043
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:49,181
Everyone, quiet, please.

1044
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:55,187
The time has come for you to bear witness to a sacred test of love.

1045
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,991
- Oh, how exciting!

1046
01:27:57,011 --> 01:27:58,722
- Are they too young for this?

1047
01:27:58,825 --> 01:27:59,868
- Are we too old?

1048
01:27:59,888 --> 01:28:00,931
- When are they coming?

1049
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,905
Please, ladies, the children are coming now.

1050
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:07,908
And remember, this is a very important moment.

1051
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:10,285
A crucial moment.

1052
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:14,706
Fujimoto, you won't let any harm come to Sosuke or Ponyo, will you?

1053
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:17,584
It's not in his nature.

1054
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:20,337
Of course I wouldn't.

1055
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:22,100
My hope is Ponyo will stay asleep.

1056
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:23,790
Excuse me.

1057
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:34,935
Do you think we can trust him?

1058
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:37,437
I wonder what Lisa is thinking.

1059
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:42,359
She's with that woman, and they've been talking all night and day.

1060
01:28:50,377 --> 01:28:51,650
Poor Lisa.

1061
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:52,943
Must be hard on her.

1062
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:55,914
I wish we could hear what they're talking about.

1063
01:28:56,007 --> 01:28:57,217
Oh, why don't we just ask.

1064
01:28:57,237 --> 01:28:58,447
Lisa!

1065
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:01,878
Lisa!

1066
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,593
Lisa!

1067
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:11,388
We wanna know what you're talking about!

1068
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:12,764
Come tell us!

1069
01:29:27,372 --> 01:29:28,207
- My dear!

1070
01:29:28,227 --> 01:29:29,062
- Lisa!

1071
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:30,240
What's going on?

1072
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:32,701
Lisa, are you sure you can trust that man?

1073
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:33,952
It's so exciting.

1074
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,037
Tell us what's going to happen next.

1075
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:38,832
Whatever happens, I'm just glad you're all here for this.

1076
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:41,877
It's going to be fine.

1077
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:08,320
I think I've been here before.

1078
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,947
Ponyo?

1079
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:13,199
Don't like this place.

1080
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:19,456
Don't let go of my hand.

1081
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:59,037
Mm… Ponyo!

1082
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:18,556
Ponyo!

1083
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:27,816
Ponyo!

1084
01:31:49,681 --> 01:31:50,871
Ponyo!

1085
01:31:50,891 --> 01:31:52,081
Please don't die!

1086
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:54,759
Ponyo!

1087
01:31:54,853 --> 01:31:56,710
- Ponyo, wake up!

1088
01:31:56,730 --> 01:31:58,587
- Shh.

1089
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,765
Be careful not to wake her.

1090
01:32:00,859 --> 01:32:02,903
It's good to meet you, Sosuke.

1091
01:32:02,923 --> 01:32:04,967
We've all been waiting for you.

1092
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:08,773
- The old ladies, your mother… - My mother?

1093
01:32:08,867 --> 01:32:10,619
Won't you come with me and join them, Sosuke?

1094
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:12,391
Ponyo, too.

1095
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:14,446
Come with me.

1096
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:17,657
I promise I'm not going to take Ponyo away from you.

1097
01:32:17,751 --> 01:32:19,086
- We have to go now.

1098
01:32:19,106 --> 01:32:20,441
- Sosuke!

1099
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,455
Sosuke, don't listen to that wacko!

1100
01:32:23,548 --> 01:32:25,926
He tricked all the others into going with him, - but he couldn't fool me!

1101
01:32:25,946 --> 01:32:28,324
- Toki!

1102
01:32:28,428 --> 01:32:29,367
Did you hear me?

1103
01:32:29,387 --> 01:32:30,326
Nobody fools me!

1104
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:32,516
There is so little time!

1105
01:32:32,536 --> 01:32:34,622
My choice has to be made!

1106
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:37,802
If the moon comes any closer… Can't you see it?

1107
01:32:37,896 --> 01:32:39,106
The world is out of balance!

1108
01:32:39,126 --> 01:32:40,336
We will all be underwater!

1109
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,067
That's the best excuse you can come up with?

1110
01:32:42,087 --> 01:32:43,714
A falling moon?

1111
01:32:43,818 --> 01:32:45,216
- Humans!

1112
01:32:45,236 --> 01:32:46,634
- Sosuke, come to me!

1113
01:32:46,738 --> 01:32:47,740
Sosuke, please listen.

1114
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:48,762
You have to trust me.

1115
01:32:48,865 --> 01:32:50,027
You're the only one who can save the planet.

1116
01:32:50,047 --> 01:32:51,209
Do it now.

1117
01:32:51,229 --> 01:32:52,391
Do it!

1118
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:55,236
Ponyo!

1119
01:32:56,905 --> 01:32:59,240
Brunhilde, respect your father!

1120
01:33:05,622 --> 01:33:07,290
Ponyo!

1121
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:10,126
Sosuke, come on!

1122
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:12,212
Bring them to me!

1123
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:19,177
Faster!

1124
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:22,639
Jump for it!

1125
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:03,304
Now what?

1126
01:34:58,286 --> 01:34:59,434
- Mama!

1127
01:34:59,454 --> 01:35:00,602
- Sosuke.

1128
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:02,405
Ponyo!

1129
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:09,454
You don't have to swim.

1130
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:11,581
I don't know why we're here.

1131
01:35:20,725 --> 01:35:22,602
- So this is Sosuke.

1132
01:35:22,622 --> 01:35:24,499
- How do you do?

1133
01:35:24,604 --> 01:35:26,106
- Are you Ponyo's mother?

1134
01:35:26,126 --> 01:35:27,628
- Yes.

1135
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:30,308
You brought my daughter safely here.

1136
01:35:30,401 --> 01:35:31,508
- Shh!

1137
01:35:31,528 --> 01:35:32,635
- Thank you.

1138
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:41,569
Sosuke, Ponyo opened a magic well because she wants very much to be human, to become a real girl.

1139
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:46,783
She needs you to accept and love her as she truly is.

1140
01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:51,329
You know that Ponyo was a fish, don't you?

1141
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:52,664
Mm-hm.

1142
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,707
And you know her as a human.

1143
01:35:54,801 --> 01:35:56,366
- Your drop of blood did that.

1144
01:35:56,386 --> 01:35:57,951
- Oh, that's it!

1145
01:35:58,054 --> 01:35:59,661
I cut my thumb.

1146
01:35:59,681 --> 01:36:01,288
Then Ponyo licked it and made it better.

1147
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:03,883
So that's how she changed into a human.

1148
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:08,680
Could you love her if she moved between two worlds?

1149
01:36:08,773 --> 01:36:10,046
Mm-hm.

1150
01:36:10,066 --> 01:36:11,339
I love all the Ponyos.

1151
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:16,062
It's a big responsibility, but I really love her.

1152
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:28,366
Ooh!

1153
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:32,078
Ponyo, come here, please.

1154
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:51,139
Ponyo, Sosuke has promised to accept you as you are.

1155
01:36:53,683 --> 01:36:57,603
To become human, you must choose to abandon magic.

1156
01:36:57,697 --> 01:36:59,408
- Can you do that?

1157
01:36:59,428 --> 01:37:01,139
- Mm-hm.

1158
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:17,665
Kiss the bubble, child, when you return to land, and Ponyo will become a girl, growing up just like you.

1159
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:23,588
I accept, Ponyo.

1160
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:26,966
Thank you very much, Ponyo's mother.

1161
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:35,516
Everyone, the balance of nature is restored.

1162
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,686
Life begins again.

1163
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:41,439
I'm so proud!

1164
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:49,113
My Sosuke.

1165
01:38:13,564 --> 01:38:14,941
- Good luck, Lisa.

1166
01:38:14,961 --> 01:38:16,338
- Thank you.

1167
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:18,226
I'll take care of her.

1168
01:38:29,455 --> 01:38:30,979
There you are!

1169
01:38:30,999 --> 01:38:32,523
Are you all right?

1170
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,997
Wait, let me get your wheelchairs!

1171
01:38:40,091 --> 01:38:41,134
Don't bother, Shima-san.

1172
01:38:41,154 --> 01:38:42,197
We like to walk.

1173
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:44,460
Life begins again.

1174
01:38:47,713 --> 01:38:49,715
This is yours, I believe.

1175
01:38:52,186 --> 01:38:53,918
- Thank you.

1176
01:38:53,938 --> 01:38:55,670
- Try to remember me kindly.

1177
01:38:55,773 --> 01:38:56,754
If you will.

1178
01:38:56,774 --> 01:38:57,755
May I?

1179
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:05,440
Take care of Ponyo.

1180
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:09,068
It's your father!

1181
01:39:13,541 --> 01:39:15,481
Koichi!

1182
01:39:15,501 --> 01:39:17,441
Hi!

1183
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:19,203
Over here!

1184
01:39:19,297 --> 01:39:21,112
Ah!

1185
01:39:21,132 --> 01:39:22,947
Lisa and Sosuke!

1186
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,750
Ahoy!

1187
01:39:24,834 --> 01:39:28,045
Look, Ponyo, there's my dad's ship!
