1
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,280
Raccoon, Raccoon, Come on out and play.

2
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,642
I can't right now, I'm eating.

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,568
What is it you're eating?

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,688
Pickled plums and radish.

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,647
How about some for me?

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,256
Hey.

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,712
Don't be so greedy.

8
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,609
We raccoons have always lived close by humans.

9
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,537
Not to steal their food.

10
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:48,914
Not at all.

11
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,838
Where there are paddies and fields, there are frogs and grasshoppers, mice and moles.

12
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,325
There's fruit, like persimmons and mulberries.

13
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,999
There's much more food than in the woods.

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,082
Last spring, the old farmhouse was suddenly abandoned.

15
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,601
It looked like no one was coming back, so we all moved in.

16
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,605
We spent a really wonderful year there.

17
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,599
Living in a detached house with a garden was like a dream.

18
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,884
But then...

19
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:49,567
We raccoons usually don't make a fuss over territory, but this was different.

20
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,801
Wherever we went looking for food, we ran into other raccoons.

21
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,649
There were quarrels, and fights over burrows.

22
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,039
And finally...

23
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,885
Pom Poko 31, autumn.

24
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:09,568
On the newly logged border between Taka and Suzu Woods, the raccoons of the Tama Hills gathered for their final battle.

25
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,881
The Red Army was commanded by Gonta, a fearsome raccoon of Taka.

26
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,286
The Blue Army was led by Seizaemon, an elder of Suzu.

27
00:02:50,170 --> 00:03:00,126
Now, it's a little-known fact, but when humans aren't around, raccoons walk on two legs, just as you see here.

28
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,326
The battle was hard-fought, but it did not last long.

29
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,480
Fight!

30
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,400
Fight!

31
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,320
Taka!

32
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,240
Fight!

33
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,160
Fight!

34
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,080
Suzu!

35
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,319
Red wins!

36
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:03,278
Blue wins!

37
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:04,237
Both of you lose!

38
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,798
Slaughter the losing raccoons!

39
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,448
Taka loses today, Suzu loses tomorrow!

40
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,403
The raccoons have nowhere to go.

41
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,124
Where can the raccoons go to?

42
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,248
There's nowhere for them to go.

43
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,487
Whether Red wins or Blue wins, both sides lose.

44
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,889
Kill the losing raccoons!

45
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,570
There are too many of them!

46
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,210
Fewer raccoons is better for all!

47
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,605
The rest of you, control yourselves!

48
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,001
Stop having children!

49
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,485
Have more children and you'll lose everything!

50
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,805
Your homes are disappearing, and that's a fact!

51
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,325
Granny Oroku was right.

52
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,402
The raccoons were stunned by the desolation around them.

53
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,441
Their woods were disappearing.

54
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:01,928
A chilling panorama of denuded, flattened hills A chilling panorama of denuded, flattened hills stretched as far as the eye could see.

55
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,642
This is madness!

56
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,523
It's no time for us to be fighting!

57
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,927
In those days, Japan was entering a golden age of economic growth.

58
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,006
Demand for housing around Tokyo exploded.

59
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,839
Lots of farmland and forest disappeared in waves of uncontrolled development.

60
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:25,403
As Tokyo grew, it gnawed the land in random patterns like a huge insect.

61
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,161
Then in 1967, the city fathers hit on a better idea: A plan for a new suburb of Tokyo called Tama New Town.

62
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:36,239
Over 300,000 people would populate an area of 3,000 hectares.

63
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:43,448
Forests would be cleared, hills flattened, valleys filled, farms and fields obliterated, old farmhouses demolished.

64
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:53,041
The Tama Hills would be transformed into an enormous construction site to create a model bedroom town for Tokyo's workers.

65
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,401
It was the largest urban development project in history.

66
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,246
You've got to hand it to these humans they're really something.

67
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,921
We always thought they were animals just like us, but now we know we were wrong.

68
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,687
They must be even more powerful than the gods.

69
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:28,604
Raccoon clans from all over the Tama Hills gathered secretly late one night at the old abandoned Manpuku Temple, deep in the forest.

70
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:36,049
By unanimous agreement of all present, the meeting was chaired by Tsurukame Osho, the temple's 105-year-old resident raccoon.

71
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:47,367
...so in view of the current difficulties, we must abandon our nocturnal habits and be prepared to act at any time of the day or night.

72
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,926
Amid some confusion, the assembly agreed on a policy to stop the development.

73
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,838
That makes it unanimous!

74
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:03,207
The raccoons turned for home, leaving it to the clan elders to work out a specific course of action.

75
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:12,644
The elders settled on a five-year program to revive the neglected art of shape-shifting and study the ways of humans.

76
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:21,049
They invited renowned practitioners of shape-shifting from Sado and Shikoku islands, where the art was most advanced, to teach the young raccoons.

77
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:26,198
But in view of the difficulties and danger posed by the long journeys required to fetch these teachers, there were none willing to go.

78
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:31,276
So, they all pretended to fall asleep.

79
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,081
I suppose we'll just have to wait for the youngsters to acquire the skills on their own.

80
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,686
Agreed!

81
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:47,367
The McDonald's hamburgers provided to facilitate the discussion were enthusiastically received.

82
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,527
And with that, the council of elders concluded.

83
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:14,483
NO DUMPING Keeping close track of the doings of humans was of the utmost importance, so the raccoons decided to set up a television in their headquarters, the main hall of Manpuku Temple.

84
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,675
- Good evening.

85
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:24,790
- Good evening!

86
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,639
The arrival of the television provoked great interest.

87
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:41,126
The headquarters at Manpuku Temple were soon crowded with visitors who were there just to spend the day watching television.

88
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,360
Shape-shifting requires the highest degree of mental concentration.

89
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,568
It means changing one's very cells in an instant.

90
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,284
Truly, this is nature's greatest miracle.

91
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:57,768
Lesser forms of transformation can be achieved by such animals as chameleons.

92
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:03,726
But only raccoons, foxes and some old cats can practice real shape-shifting.

93
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,358
Gonta!

94
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:14,368
That you can assume such an appearance, even for a moment, proves you've taken the first steps on the path, whether you realize it or not.

95
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,754
If one studies hard and grasps the basics, any raccoon can learn to shape-shift.

96
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:21,028
At least in theory.

97
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,527
Allow me to demonstrate!

98
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,881
Aren't you going to put a leaf on your head?

99
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,850
That's for beginners!

100
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,646
That's for beginners!

101
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,363
It's been a long time!

102
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,760
And a one, and a two!

103
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:50,885
With Granny Oroku as their instructor, the raccoons made steady progress in the art of shape-shifting.

104
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:56,130
Young raccoons from every clan burned with desire to hone their skills.

105
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,323
Bravo, Shokichi!

106
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,375
- Gotcha!

107
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,190
- Gotcha!

108
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,207
Gotcha!

109
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,521
I've been interested in humans and their ways ever since I was a child.

110
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:22,326
As a rule we weren't supposed to approach them, but for my late father, I think that just sharpened his interest.

111
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:30,121
Careful observation of humans is a basic requirement for shape-shifting, so I'm sure he thought getting close to them would prove useful.

112
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,085
It goes without saying that some of our raccoons were not good students.

113
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:58,682
In fact, many of them simply couldn't manage at all.

114
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:05,123
Shape-shifting requires rigorous physical and mental discipline.

115
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:11,448
Naturally this discouraged many of the raccoons, who unlike foxes, are inclined to be rather lazy.

116
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,446
Hey!

117
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,325
Ponkichi!

118
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,919
All the arhats are here!

119
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:26,398
Turn them!

120
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:26,989
Turn!

121
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:27,458
Turn!

122
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:27,927
Turn!

123
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:28,396
Turn!

124
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,919
Back then all I thought about was shape-shifting.

125
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:37,089
I never dreamed my childhood pal Ponkichi wanted nothing more than to live like a normal raccoon.

126
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:49,644
...so when the traveler reached the mountain pass, he saw the pine tree seemed to have grown an extra branch.

127
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,725
Now, this was odd.

128
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,809
The traveler said to himself, "There wasn't a branch on that side last time."

129
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,196
And lo and behold!

130
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,472
The branch switched sides.

131
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,336
Seeing this, the traveler said aloud, "That's not right either.

132
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,392
There were branches on both sides."

133
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,727
And sure enough, branches sprouted on both sides.

134
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,283
The next instant, boom!

135
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,316
Something fell!

136
00:12:13,336 --> 00:12:15,272
What was it, do you suppose?

137
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,439
A raccoon!

138
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,092
Right!

139
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,184
And why did he fall?

140
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:20,276
Gonta?

141
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,777
He was a klutz.

142
00:12:21,797 --> 00:12:23,154
I'd never fall.

143
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,119
That's the spirit!

144
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,718
Sasuke, why do you think he fell?

145
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,645
He had to let go of the tree to make two branches.

146
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,504
Very good!

147
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:34,968
And what is the moral of this story?

148
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,432
Shokichi?

149
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,724
It doesn't pay to take what humans say literally.

150
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,976
That's correct.

151
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,512
We raccoons are naturally good-natured.

152
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,215
We get carried away!

153
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:47,790
We try too hard to please!

154
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,518
This is where we go wrong.

155
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:51,156
Do you see?

156
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,569
Yes, Tsurukame Osho!

157
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,919
So if I were to say: "Mr.

158
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:57,198
Raccoon, Mr.

159
00:12:57,218 --> 00:12:59,477
Raccoon, come out and play"?

160
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,444
We're in the middle of a lesson now!

161
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,130
See?

162
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,700
You're already getting carried away!

163
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,270
This is what worries me!

164
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,977
As the raccoons worked to understand humans and practice shape-shifting, winter turned to spring.

165
00:13:27,997 --> 00:13:33,154
The plum trees blossomed, and love was in the air.

166
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:43,002
But most of the raccoons heeded Granny Oroku's admonition to remain chaste and avoid having children until everyone's homes were safe again.

167
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:52,446
They suppressed their maternal instincts and firmly rejected the clumsy efforts of the males to woo them.

168
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,965
Meanwhile, the massive building program was picking up steam.

169
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,206
Woods were cleared, the earth was scoured, and construction sites multiplied.

170
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:11,603
The raccoons, filled with anger and sadness, called these sites "bald hills."

171
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:17,458
Mr.

172
00:14:17,478 --> 00:14:23,236
Postman, you dropped something Freed from the work of child-rearing, some of the females started to practice shape-shifting too.

173
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,486
When males tried to pass themselves off as women or children, the overall effect was not quite right.

174
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,568
With the participation of the females, this problem was solved.

175
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:37,489
Naturally, some of the females wanted to try their hand at turning into males.

176
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:45,199
Ah, I'd like the males to stay after class today.

177
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:51,121
One day, Tsurukame Osho gave a special lecture for the males.

178
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:58,245
Now then, what do you think the carpet you are all sitting on is?

179
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,717
I may as well tell you.

180
00:15:00,737 --> 00:15:02,634
It's my testicles!

181
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,916
It's exactly eight mats.

182
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:07,112
And I'll prove it!

183
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,729
The time finally came for the students to test their skills in the real world.

184
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,765
The exercise was conducted like a driving lesson.

185
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:34,204
Each student was accompanied by an advanced partner, in case of unforeseen problems or someone seeing through their disguise.

186
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:10,599
Shape-shifting requires large amounts of energy, especially when assuming human form.

187
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:18,968
The dark circles raccoons have around their eyes are the result of sheer fatigue.

188
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:26,405
Even experienced shape-shifters have to secretly carry special herbs to replenish their strength at a moment's notice.

189
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:33,683
Otherwise, out pops the tail, and the next thing you know, they're back to their original form.

190
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:40,519
Recently raccoons have discovered that quick-acting energy drinks widely sold in stores are a good pick-me-up.

191
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:50,369
To graduate from the shape-shifting course, students had to pass one final test: To go out and earn at least 1,000 yen through honest labor.

192
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,926
Help!

193
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,803
Some raccoons got together and took turns impersonating the same human.

194
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,161
Others transformed themselves into monks with begging bowls.

195
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,966
Some females worked in clubs and raked in money drinking with customers.

196
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,767
Another raccoon parlayed a discarded pachinko ball into big money.

197
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:14,082
One tricky raccoon burgled a temple donation box, but all he got was small change.

198
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,044
So he transformed some leaves into bills, but Oroku saw right through him.

199
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,402
I told you modern shape-shifting forbids turning leaves into money!

200
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,160
One day, an urgent report interrupted Gonta's training at headquarters.

201
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,487
He hurried home to Taka Woods to face tragedy.

202
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:44,607
More than half his childhood home had already been ravaged by construction.

203
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,130
Gonta went mad with grief.

204
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,165
Gonta went mad with grief.

205
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:56,082
He raced back to headquarters and forced Tsurukame Osho to call a meeting of the clan elders, where he called for a strategy of violent attacks on the humans.

206
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,682
I'm completely against this.

207
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,765
Why?

208
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,757
The time is not ripe.

209
00:18:01,777 --> 00:18:03,634
We're still in the first year of the Five-Year Plan.

210
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,978
We've all completed our training.

211
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:08,236
There's a lot we can do right now!

212
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,096
What do you think, Granny?

213
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:13,872
Do you think these youngsters are up to it?

214
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,246
True, they've mastered the basics, but...

215
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,849
But?

216
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,519
They lack experience.

217
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,118
One slip and they'll be exposed.

218
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,649
Gonta, I have to ask you this.

219
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:32,846
I think your anger at what happened to Taka Woods is clouding your judgment.

220
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,846
Isn't that so?

221
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,479
I swear there is absolutely no truth to that.

222
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,523
I'm thinking of the welfare of all the raccoons of Tama.

223
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,403
What do you mean, everyone's welfare?

224
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,280
Don't forget, Gonta's the one who tried to take over Suzu Woods!

225
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,795
Shut up!

226
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:54,190
Even if no one's for it, we raccoons of Taka are going ahead anyway.

227
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,128
If Gonta's that determined, I'm going to help him!

228
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,888
You too, Shokichi?

229
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,648
Thank you!

230
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,007
It's too late to stop us now!

231
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,808
Not so fast!

232
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,569
Don't try to stop us, Granny!

233
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,963
Just this once, I'll teach you a special technique!

234
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:23,967
If you bungle this, you won't return to your original form for five days.

235
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,643
So, what is it?

236
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,760
A dead fox!

237
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,046
Pom Poko 32, summer.

238
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:41,887
Ten young volunteers led by Gonta of Taka Woods set out to apply their new skills in shape-shifting with a series of desperate surprise attacks on the humans.

239
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,088
The raccoons were fighting back at last.

240
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,379
- Here they come!

241
00:19:58,399 --> 00:19:59,238
- They're coming!

242
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,255
Keep going!

243
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:06,950
Keep going!

244
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,888
We did it!

245
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,919
Multiple Accidents At Construction Site Disaster struck the Tama New Town development at approximately 2:30 p.m.

246
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:12,122
A series of landslides and accidents killed three workers, injured two, and destroyed a residence under construction.

247
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:17,602
Live Police suspect reduced visibility and unstable ground from heavy rains.

248
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:26,162
The widespread, simultaneous nature of the accidents is raising concern there may be fundamental problems with the development plan.

249
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:32,280
Some local residents are calling for a review of the plan.

250
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,201
Hold on, everyone!

251
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:46,528
I think we should take a moment to remember the poor humans who died in this operation.

252
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,647
Osho is right.

253
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:54,686
Let's observe a minute of silent prayer for the unfortunate victims.

254
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,177
Agreed!

255
00:21:56,197 --> 00:21:57,554
A minute of silence!

256
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,681
All pray!

257
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,805
Look, it's Gonta!

258
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,121
The heroes have returned!

259
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,801
You really did it, Shokichi!

260
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:08,128
You youngsters have put hope back in this old heart of mine.

261
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,417
That was only the beginning!

262
00:23:10,437 --> 00:23:11,754
Today was just a practice run!

263
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,244
Raccoons, the war has started!

264
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:22,729
We must kill, crush, and mangle every human we can, until they are driven from the Tama Hills!

265
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,364
Shokichi, you should say something too!

266
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,039
And let's plant trees!

267
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:30,638
Lots and lots of our favorite persimmon trees!

268
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,925
Little persimmon seeds, send out your shoots!

269
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,568
We'll have all the persimmons we can eat!

270
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,960
Out with the humans!

271
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,240
Slaughter the humans!

272
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,857
OK, OK, OK.

273
00:23:46,877 --> 00:23:49,394
But first we must celebrate this auspicious victory!

274
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,239
You know, something worries me.

275
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,760
What?

276
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,438
Are we really going to drive out all the humans?

277
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,559
Of course!

278
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,205
Can't we let a few of them stay, the way it used to be?

279
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,617
No way!

280
00:24:03,637 --> 00:24:04,914
The two-legs are our sworn enemies.

281
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,558
They're vermin.

282
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,076
We've got to get rid of them once and for all!

283
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,837
I see.

284
00:24:10,857 --> 00:24:12,874
I mean, look, I hate humans too.

285
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,171
Well, some of them are not so bad.

286
00:24:15,191 --> 00:24:17,382
I mean, I really do hate them.

287
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:19,593
But...

288
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,558
But what?

289
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:26,969
But if we get rid of them all, we'll never eat tempura again!

290
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,404
Or sardines!

291
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,440
Or corn!

292
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,919
Hamburgers!

293
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:34,118
Donuts!

294
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:35,317
Fried chicken!

295
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:36,516
Potato chips!

296
00:24:36,536 --> 00:24:37,715
Pizza!

297
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,799
I can taste it!

298
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:45,083
Well then, Gonta, shall we let a few of the humans stay?

299
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,478
I guess it can't be helped.

300
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,297
Hooray for Gon!

301
00:24:51,317 --> 00:24:52,394
Lift him up, fellows!

302
00:24:53,730 --> 00:25:07,838
The moon, moon, moon shines bright Over Man, Man, Manpuku Temple All our friends are here tonight Pon poko pon pon, pon pon!

303
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,165
We'll show the world What Tsurukame Osho can do!

304
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,451
Come on, come on!

305
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:14,662
All our friends are here tonight!

306
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:16,873
Come on, come on!

307
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:29,685
... a government spokesman stressed that the project is an urgent necessity for the people of Tokyo, and that today's accidents will not affect the government's determination to carry out the building of Tama New Town.

308
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,718
What?!

309
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,722
It was a very unfortunate accident.

310
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:45,685
Poor Gonta, the driving force behind the attacks, suffered fractures and internal injuries that would take a year to heal.

311
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:53,289
The news report plunged the raccoons into depression.

312
00:25:53,410 --> 00:26:00,327
But when television began to cover local residents' fears of divine retribution, their spirits soared again.

313
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:05,320
Maybe it was a mistake, moving that Shinto shrine.

314
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,326
How do you mean?

315
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:11,605
Maybe all these incidents are revenge from the gods of the shrine.

316
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:15,764
It's true that a lot of Jizo statues and shrines have been moved.

317
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,920
Yes, that really worried me.

318
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:22,607
I asked the developers to observe the proper ceremonies before moving them, but...

319
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,927
Professor Mizuki, what do you think about all this?

320
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:31,044
These spirit entities are usually associated with a given location.

321
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:36,441
If their abodes are moved, they'll try to return home.

322
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,483
If they do, and find everything has changed, they naturally become upset.

323
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,046
I have a feeling there's a lot more trouble to come.

324
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,561
Maybe I can save my woods after all.

325
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,203
Shokichi and the others went into action.

326
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:07,164
The owner of Shokichi's woods came to inspect his property with one of the developers before construction began.

327
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,327
To his surprise, he saw a lot more Jizo statues than he remembered.

328
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:16,404
"I'd better give this more thought," he told the developer, and held off on signing the contract to sell his land.

329
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:30,204
During a ceremony at another shrine that was slated to be moved, one of the raccoons suddenly appeared on the roof disguised as a fox, the shrine's servant to the gods.

330
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,570
The fox's eerie cry brought the proceedings to an immediate halt.

331
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,320
The fox's eerie cry brought the proceedings to an immediate halt.

332
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:44,682
The ceremony was canceled, the shrine's relocation put on hold, and residents petitioned the authorities to change plans for a road through the area.

333
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,246
The raccoons were on a roll.

334
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:04,249
Each group tried to outdo the others in a campaign of guerrilla operations.

335
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,719
Come this way!

336
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,686
Go away!

337
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,445
Take it with you!

338
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,565
Let's take all the trash and leftovers with us.

339
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,288
The leftovers!

340
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,089
Leave them behind!

341
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,926
Is something wrong, miss?

342
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,761
What's the trouble?

343
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,009
I have no face!

344
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,648
A goblin!

345
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,318
- J-j-just now, I...

346
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:29,996
I saw - A murder?

347
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,961
N-no, it was...

348
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,760
Not a murder?

349
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,040
Too bad!

350
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:38,128
Th-th-there was a woman!

351
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,086
- Did she have a mouth like a shark?

352
00:29:39,106 --> 00:29:39,932
- No!

353
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:40,778
No!

354
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:41,624
She was...

355
00:29:41,644 --> 00:29:42,470
I mean...

356
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,449
Then, was she something like this?

357
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,963
It's her!

358
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:08,765
Was... she... something... like... this?

359
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:20,729
The raccoons took endless delight in frightening the humans.

360
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,601
After every big success, they held a celebration.

361
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:34,482
But Gonta, the one who started it all, showed no signs of recovering from his injuries.

362
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:40,480
His loving wife Otama cared for him tenderly, but she could not soothe his frustration at being out of the fight.

363
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,080
Frankly, Gonta thought his raccoon friends were wimps.

364
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,923
Yesterday's News Train was priceless.

365
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,439
That special about "Tama New Goblin Town."

366
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,323
They interviewed the cop we scared.

367
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,238
The other guests laughed in his face.

368
00:30:54,258 --> 00:30:56,036
He was so furious!

369
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,834
I almost died!

370
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,746
Idiot!

371
00:30:59,766 --> 00:31:01,572
So what?

372
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:03,398
Are they going to stop the project just because of stuff like that?

373
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,998
If you're going to shape-shift, do it the way I did!

374
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,321
Cause accidents, and kill them!

375
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,317
- Oh, no!

376
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:13,194
- Gonta!

377
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,924
It was just as Gonta said.

378
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,887
The project didn't stop.

379
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:28,240
Rivers were encased in concrete, roads were laid out everywhere, masses of building material flowed in, and the construction of thousands of apartments finally got under way.

380
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:37,998
The strange happenings on the construction sites and in the hills The strange happenings on the construction sites and in the hills received nationwide coverage.

381
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,127
The raccoons became more and more confident of ultimate victory.

382
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,724
Rock, paper, scissors...

383
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,680
Pom Poko Year 32, autumn.

384
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:58,202
It was time to choose messengers to travel to Sado and Shikoku islands, to seek the help of famous masters in the art of shape-shifting.

385
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,002
Tamasaburo of Oni Woods was chosen to go to Shikoku.

386
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,929
Bunta of Mizunomi Marsh was chosen to travel to Sado.

387
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:19,606
So at the next full moon, the two young raccoons said farewell to their comrades and set out for their destinations in high spirits.

388
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,049
What a smell!

389
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:41,009
The raccoons continued haunting the construction sites.

390
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:54,403
They were having so much fun with their shape-shifting, they almost didn't care whether it was effective or not.

391
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,859
- Out with the demons!

392
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:10,638
- Daddy!

393
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,804
Will this really drive out the humans?

394
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,964
Won't they see through us one of these days?

395
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,919
Maybe we should really go after them, like Gonta says.

396
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,327
What does it matter if one or two get killed?

397
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:00,440
"To be, or not to be, that is the question."

398
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,445
Kiyo!

399
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,202
What are you doing up there?

400
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,689
Something wrong with your neck?

401
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,397
I was posing for you.

402
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:28,314
I was hoping you'd say I was pretty.

403
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,760
Oh, sorry.

404
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,605
Now there really is something wrong with my neck.

405
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,000
You looked pretty.

406
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:35,765
It's too late.

407
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,723
I mean it.

408
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,914
It's OK.

409
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:43,108
I just need more practice.

410
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:54,523
One day a raccoon from Potamochi Mountain...

411
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,695
Everyone likes that song, don't they?

412
00:34:57,715 --> 00:34:59,310
I kind of like it myself.

413
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,007
Do you know the song, Where Are You From?

414
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,285
Yes, but I can't sing all the lyrics.

415
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,439
That song used to be...

416
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:11,361
There was a raccoon from Senba Along came a hunter...

417
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,886
A hunter shot my grandpa.

418
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,436
I'm sorry.

419
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:17,192
I didn't know.

420
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,337
That's OK.

421
00:35:20,357 --> 00:35:22,754
But Grandpa wasn't boiled or fried.

422
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:26,599
Someone paid a lot for his pelt.

423
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,763
I really like your fur too.

424
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,617
Why, that makes me happy.

425
00:35:30,637 --> 00:35:31,954
Coming from you, that is.

426
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,165
So, what were you going to say about that song?

427
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,004
My father used to sing it.

428
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,569
He was a good ball-bouncer too.

429
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,284
He must have been a character.

430
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:52,084
Whenever he got to the end of the song, he always warned us.

431
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,919
About what?

432
00:35:54,050 --> 00:36:01,440
"You kids better remember: Even in a simple ball-bouncing song, you hear about the cruel nature of humans."

433
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,836
"How they hunt us raccoons, kill us and eat us.

434
00:36:03,856 --> 00:36:06,112
And don't you forget it!"

435
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,360
Say, shall we bounce balls?

436
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,843
Are you good at it?

437
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,722
Yes, I'm pretty good.

438
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,327
Then I better do my best too!

439
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,091
Where are you from?

440
00:36:29,111 --> 00:36:30,502
Higo.

441
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,913
Where's Higo?

442
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,519
In Kumamoto.

443
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:34,998
Where's Kumamoto?

444
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:36,477
In Semba.

445
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:40,159
There was a raccoon from Semba.

446
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,200
Along came...

447
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,289
Shokichi, when are you going to do that "Operation Twin Star" you talked about?

448
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,799
Oh, I don't really want to do it anymore.

449
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,319
But it was such a good plan.

450
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,836
Why don't we do it tonight?

451
00:36:52,856 --> 00:36:53,832
Just the two of us.

452
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,847
With you?

453
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,843
Are you afraid to do it with me?

454
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,558
No, it's not that.

455
00:36:59,578 --> 00:37:01,196
It's just...

456
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,398
Then let's try.

457
00:37:03,418 --> 00:37:05,196
I'm sure it will go over really well.

458
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,757
OK, let's do it!

459
00:37:07,777 --> 00:37:09,634
With you as my partner, I bet things will go great.

460
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,525
I can't wait!

461
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,404
Well, well, what adorable little children!

462
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:30,006
We just got back from a trip to the stars, but our home is gone.

463
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,958
A trip to the stars?

464
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:37,045
From red-eyed Scorpio to the Eagle's wings...

465
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,686
From the coils of the Snake to the brow of the Bear Cub!

466
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:46,890
We sprinkle the dew and frost as we fly among the stars.

467
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,319
What is this?!

468
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,817
Our home is gone!

469
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:55,114
We're cold!

470
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,889
Mister, do you know where our home went?

471
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,996
Your home?

472
00:38:01,016 --> 00:38:03,112
I don't know what you mean.

473
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,377
Nobody knows!

474
00:38:04,397 --> 00:38:05,554
Run along now!

475
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,897
We should call the police.

476
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,154
Someone get the police here!

477
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,049
Hey, what are you kids doing?

478
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,240
They're not kids, they're gremlins!

479
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,280
Gremlins?!

480
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,125
Little gremlins, please don't be angry!

481
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,200
Now, just hold on a minute.

482
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,452
I'll treat you right!

483
00:38:58,472 --> 00:38:59,624
You want a raise?

484
00:38:59,644 --> 00:39:00,796
Come on, give me a break!

485
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,998
Nope, I've had it.

486
00:39:03,018 --> 00:39:05,076
I'm going back home.

487
00:39:05,096 --> 00:39:07,154
I can't stay in these haunted hills.

488
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,043
Come on, Suzuki.

489
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:15,085
I heard Tokyo was a scary place, but this is too much for me.

490
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:17,326
You'd best stop the construction.

491
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:22,002
Whether it's gods or devils, somebody or something is really upset about this project.

492
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,688
The raccoons cheered.

493
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:34,246
That evening's celebrations were especially grand.

494
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:39,000
Naturally, the guests of honor were the two heroes, Kiyo and Shokichi.

495
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:49,287
Meanwhile, the workers' quarters were dark and silent.

496
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,924
But the next morning...

497
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:56,283
It seemed there was an endless supply of humans.

498
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:02,159
No matter how many the raccoons scared away, there were always others to take their place.

499
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:07,768
It's rumored among local residents that this may be the work of foxes and raccoons.

500
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,328
That would make things simple enough.

501
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,443
All we'd have to do is exterminate all the offending animals.

502
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,489
The raccoons monitoring the broadcast were shocked.

503
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:23,280
But these incidents are right out of old folk tales.

504
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,482
It's not surprising people think foxes and raccoons are behind it.

505
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:30,489
But that's precisely what proves this is all just malicious rumors.

506
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,198
What do you mean, rumors?!

507
00:40:32,218 --> 00:40:33,836
I saw it with my own eyes!

508
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,283
Oh, all right.

509
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,408
In that case, we'll issue an extermination order for these pests.

510
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,242
As soon as you find any more raccoons playing more tricks, let us know immediately.

511
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:49,289
That is, if you can prove it!

512
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:55,969
Shokichi was not the only one who wondered whether shape-shifting was enough to drive out the humans.

513
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:00,049
As you all know, the Edo period was a golden age for raccoons.

514
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:07,679
Raccoon shape-shifting was a frequent subject for painters and writers.

515
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,527
But unfortunately, we raccoons were too conspicuous.

516
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,289
We aroused the resentment of humans.

517
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:22,640
In the modern era, we've been hunted for our pelts, and our fur has been used for paintbrushes and toothbrushes.

518
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,689
That's how the humans took revenge for our excesses.

519
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:40,644
Don't any of you ever forget: The past few decades have been peaceful for us raccoons only because we've exercised restraint and not used shape-shifting too often.

520
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,486
Our talents are a two-edged sword.

521
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,649
I want all of you to use this technique with discretion.

522
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:52,123
Otherwise, we'll invite further retribution from the humans.

523
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:00,241
Oroku's speech dashed cold water on the spirits of the young raccoons.

524
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:11,608
And now autumn was upon them, the time of year when raccoons need enough food to store ample fat and grow the long, fluffy coats needed for the coming winter.

525
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:33,366
The young raccoons focused their attention and shape-shifting skills on getting food for the winter.

526
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:41,082
One day, an exhausted raccoon arrived in the Tama Hills.

527
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:00,046
Don't worry, we're raccoons too!

528
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,889
Thank you very much.

529
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,635
You seem completely worn out.

530
00:43:09,655 --> 00:43:12,030
Where did you come from?

531
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,523
From Fujino Woods.

532
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,555
Is that on Shikoku island?

533
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:15,470
Sado island?

534
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,455
Why, no.

535
00:43:17,475 --> 00:43:19,310
It's just over the mountains from here.

536
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,698
Just over the mountains?

537
00:43:21,718 --> 00:43:23,996
So you're not from Shikoku after all.

538
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,139
Oh, my, I'm sorry.

539
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:29,158
I'm afraid I've disappointed you.

540
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,362
No, it's just that we've been waiting for someone from there.

541
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:36,449
So, what brought you here?

542
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:42,487
Now I finally know where all that dirt is coming from, the dirt that's ruining our woods!

543
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:51,728
According to this raccoon named Hayashi, a huge amount of excavated dirt was being illegally dumped in Fujino Woods.

544
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:59,368
The streams were polluted, there were frequent landslides, and the raccoons and other animals of the woods were in dire straits.

545
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:08,926
To find out where all this discarded earth was coming from, Hayashi assumed human form and caught a ride on one of the dump trucks.

546
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:21,084
Unfortunately, shape-shifting was not one of his strong points.

547
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:27,159
The swaying of the truck and the stress of the journey made him fall asleep, and he changed back into a raccoon.

548
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,016
It's not just Fujino Woods.

549
00:44:29,036 --> 00:44:30,512
Other woods are being ruined too.

550
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,848
And now there are garbage dumps and golf courses all over the place.

551
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:38,201
Our Tama Hills are leveled, and we suffer.

552
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:43,245
Then the dirt is dumped in Fujino Woods, and you suffer.

553
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,680
When will this insanity end?

554
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,641
And I was so astonished at what I found here!

555
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:55,281
I thought the trucks came from some site in the middle of Tokyo.

556
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:57,600
But we're in the hills here!

557
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:00,039
They dig up one hill and dump it on another!

558
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:04,083
I just can't understand why the humans are doing this.

559
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:11,606
So if we stop the construction, it will help the raccoons in Fujino Woods too, right?

560
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,687
What stirring words!

561
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:23,765
I beg you all to use your skills in shape-shifting to save our woods too!

562
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:29,004
Well, you see, it's not really that simple, even for us.

563
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:36,845
Where could Bunta and Tamasaburo be?

564
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:40,246
They were supposed to go and fetch the masters to help us.

565
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:47,767
There was no word from Shikoku or Sado.

566
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:51,041
And so winter came to the Tama Hills.

567
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:59,319
With the raccoons down for the winter, the haunting of Tama New Town was forgotten, and media attention evaporated.

568
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:05,322
The papers were filled with stories of celebrity scandals and sordid political goings on.

569
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:17,278
Sleet covers the garden of Manpuku Temple The sleet's like ice cream!

570
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,294
All our friends are here!

571
00:46:19,314 --> 00:46:21,188
Pom poko pon pon, pon pon!

572
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,560
New Year's Day, Pom Poko 33.

573
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:29,087
The Tama Hills greeted the new year covered with a rare blanket of snow.

574
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:39,884
Most of the construction workers had already returned to their hometowns and were enjoying the holidays surrounded by their families.

575
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,676
Push!

576
00:46:41,696 --> 00:46:43,352
Push!

577
00:46:43,372 --> 00:46:45,028
Push!

578
00:46:55,010 --> 00:47:08,284
Our golden balls swing and swing Though there's not a breath of wind The baby raccoon sees our balls And swings his too...

579
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,299
We saw it!

580
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:10,158
It really happened!

581
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,963
A bunch of raccoons pushed that earth mover over the cliff!

582
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,079
We're not lying!

583
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:22,760
Police suspect the workers, who stayed behind over the new year holidays, were inspired by the numerous pranks that finally stopped last fall.

584
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:27,206
However, snow around the crime scene has melted, and it may be difficult to gather evidence.

585
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:29,400
I hope you know what you're doing, Shokichi.

586
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,839
Oh, I think we'll be all right.

587
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,847
What a stupid prank.

588
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,158
Not at all.

589
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:39,969
Shokichi was trying to encourage the raccoons who can't shape-shift Shokichi was trying to encourage the raccoons who can't shape-shift by giving them a way to help.

590
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,722
What do you think, Osho?

591
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:45,525
Hmm, I don't see any great harm done.

592
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,680
It was just as Osho predicted.

593
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:51,598
The three workers were released for lack of evidence.

594
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,443
Naturally, no one believed the raccoons were responsible.

595
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:57,004
The case remained unsolved.

596
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:07,841
And so spring came.

597
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:19,163
The season of love had arrived once again The raccoons had been chaste for more than a year, and were unable to control themselves any longer.

598
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:27,284
The air was filled with sweet nothings, and the raccoons pursued and wooed each other until the very skies turned rosy.

599
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:31,814
Hanako!

600
00:48:31,834 --> 00:48:32,428
Wait!

601
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,324
Hanako!

602
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:43,646
You're walking much better!

603
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,400
Hanako!

604
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,680
Wait just a minute!

605
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:50,244
Can't you catch me?

606
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:54,845
Everyone has spring fever.

607
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:57,723
I guess we're all like the flowers and the trees.

608
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:02,840
When winter ends and the sun shines down on us, we can't help sending out shoots.

609
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,367
Then at last we blossom and bear fruit.

610
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:12,120
But we have to keep our promise to Granny.

611
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:16,004
Let's stay chaste until we've finally won this war.

612
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:21,241
Shokichi, you're so wonderful.

613
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,486
I'm so happy!

614
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,285
Our love will last forever!

615
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,365
Shokichi!

616
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,762
That was a mistake.

617
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:50,165
Their love grew passionate, and later that year, four charming young raccoons were born to Kiyo and Shokichi.

618
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:56,965
Kincho Daimyo Shrine Now the previous autumn, Tamasaburo had managed to reach the island of Shikoku after many trials and hardships.

619
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:03,529
He presented his request for help to the master of shape-shifting, Kincho VI, but then he collapsed and was very ill for many weeks.

620
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:09,241
Luckily, Kincho had a daughter, Koharu, who stayed by Tamasaburo's bedside and miraculously nursed him back to health.

621
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:14,841
With the coming of spring, their bond deepened, and Koharu bore Tamasaburo three cubs.

622
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:24,607
The island's elders held a council in the inner chambers of the shrine.

623
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:35,923
They all agreed that success in stopping Tama New Town would be an important blow against similar construction all over Japan.

624
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:46,283
But the elders were divided as to who to send, how affairs in Shikoku would be handled, and how to avoid any succession disputes that might arise in case something should happen to one of the participants.

625
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:49,925
Hundreds of questions were raised, but no conclusions were reached.

626
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,318
It's such beautiful weather.

627
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:56,236
But Father and the others just talk, talk, talk.

628
00:51:57,090 --> 00:52:00,685
They've been debating for six months now.

629
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:04,041
When will they ever reach a decision?

630
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:08,202
Oh, I hope they never reach a decision!

631
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:21,968
Tamasaburo, just the thought that you might someday return to far-off Tama Hills makes my heart ache with sadness.

632
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,974
Koharu...

633
00:52:28,994 --> 00:52:32,028
I too dream that this happiness we have may never end.

634
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,646
Why must it be just a dream?

635
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:40,445
I'll ask Father.

636
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:44,882
I'll ask him to let you stay here and be his successor.

637
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:08,530
While Tamasaburo was struggling to make a decision, Bunta of Mizunomi Marsh roamed the fields and mountains of Sado island, searching for a master of shape-shifting called Danzaburo.

638
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,646
Searching for a master of shape-shifting called Danzaburo.

639
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:17,444
But he found no one who knew anything about the master's whereabouts.

640
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:29,048
During the summer and fall of that year, the raccoons of Tama Hills were beset by a series of misfortunes.

641
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:32,645
Their woods continued to shrink before the onslaught of development.

642
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:41,799
And just when the baby boom of spring had brought many new mouths to feed, poor summer weather brought a serious food shortage.

643
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:46,208
There were not nearly enough chestnuts and persimmons to eat that fall.

644
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:54,160
Those with shape-shifting skills tried to help by gathering food meant for humans, but it was still not nearly enough to feed the growing cubs.

645
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:14,046
Finally, even raccoons who could not shape-shift were forced to come out of the woods and scavenge around human dwellings, looking for anything to feed their children.

646
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:22,445
Inevitably, some of them began to lose their lives on the roads and in traps.

647
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:58,805
I can't take any more!

648
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:04,364
The time has come for each of us to take at least one human life, even if we lose our own.

649
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:07,323
Are you sure you're all right now, Gonta?

650
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,612
Of course!

651
00:55:08,632 --> 00:55:09,784
See?

652
00:55:09,804 --> 00:55:10,956
I'm in the pink!

653
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,499
This is wonderful.

654
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:22,638
When should we celebrate your recovery?

655
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:27,127
This isn't the time for parties, Granny.

656
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:33,520
I think we should wait for the masters of shape-shifting to get here before we decide our strategy.

657
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,318
You too, Shokichi?

658
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:37,036
You're too young to be such a coward.

659
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,377
You're wrong.

660
00:55:38,397 --> 00:55:39,634
We can't underestimate the humans.

661
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:42,728
If we attack them head on, they'll destroy us.

662
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,761
We've waited long enough!

663
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,416
Be patient.

664
00:55:47,436 --> 00:55:48,952
Let's hear Shokichi out.

665
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:53,402
I propose we adopt three policies until the masters arrive.

666
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:58,081
One: Establish a system of distributing food to raccoons who can't shape-shift.

667
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:00,246
In other words, a rationing system.

668
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:04,687
Two: Thorough training in traffic safety.

669
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:10,406
Three: Formation of rescue squads for raccoons caught in traps.

670
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,361
That's my proposal.

671
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:17,041
Shokichi, you're practically like one of the humans.

672
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,559
No!

673
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:19,918
I'm a raccoon, born and bred.

674
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,536
Well then, leaving the particulars to later.

675
00:56:24,556 --> 00:56:27,312
All in favor?

676
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,042
Hands up!

677
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:31,049
In favor!

678
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,441
What is this nonsense, Gonta?

679
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,475
It's not nonsense!

680
00:56:35,495 --> 00:56:36,390
It's a coup d'etat!

681
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,176
Anyone who opposes me from now on will be killed by my private guard!

682
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:41,832
Got it?

683
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,118
Those are dangerous words, Gonta.

684
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,322
That's "Sir Gon."

685
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,336
Raccoons!

686
00:56:51,356 --> 00:56:52,872
We all know the humans are dangerous.

687
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:56,167
If we attack without concern for our own safety, victory will be ours.

688
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,595
They can be killed.

689
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,910
As the saying goes, "a trapped mouse will beat the cat."

690
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,962
What's that supposed to mean?

691
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,409
He doesn't look like a mouse.

692
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,640
He means, we can win, if we're desperate.

693
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,089
Exactly.

694
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:12,446
If a mouse is cornered, he'll find the strength to beat the cat.

695
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,125
We're not mice, Gonta.

696
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:17,087
What's the point in beating a cat?

697
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:22,489
Come to think of it, it's been a while since I had a nice mouse.

698
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,168
Mouse tempura can't be beat.

699
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:27,324
No, deep fried is the tastiest!

700
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,158
Are you sure?

701
00:57:29,178 --> 00:57:30,876
I think the tempura batter really makes it.

702
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:34,320
That crispy deep fried tail!

703
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:39,607
What the hell are you talking about!?

704
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,319
What's important is I love mouse tempura!

705
00:57:42,339 --> 00:57:44,958
Yes, I do!

706
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,998
See Gonta?

707
00:57:47,018 --> 00:57:48,556
All we can think about is food.

708
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:53,280
I think we'd better wait for the masters to get here.

709
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:56,489
My apologies.

710
00:57:56,610 --> 00:58:03,927
I suppose it was too much to expect the young raccoons to stay chaste and not have babies.

711
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,000
No!

712
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,560
Instead of fewer raccoons, we need fewer humans!

713
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:13,879
The places they've infested used to be our homes!

714
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,180
The humans are the intruders!

715
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,360
Drive them out!

716
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,219
The humans are the intruders!

717
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:18,078
Drive them out!

718
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,645
Kill them!

719
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,135
Drive them out!

720
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:23,990
Kill them!

721
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:26,129
But at that very moment...

722
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,438
Hey, taxi!

723
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:15,087
I'll tell everyone you're here!

724
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:27,445
Tamasaburo!

725
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:29,879
I've brought the masters from Shikoku!

726
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:34,235
Tamasaburo!

727
00:59:34,255 --> 00:59:35,150
You did it!

728
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:50,046
Friends, on our way here we saw your devastated woods.

729
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,649
You have our deepest sympathy.

730
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:54,359
We'd like to address all raccoons tonight.

731
00:59:54,379 --> 00:59:56,958
There's no time to lose.

732
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,806
Pompoko 33, autumn.

733
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:04,401
All the raccoons assembled to welcome the three masters from Shikoku.

734
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:10,249
There's a good moon out tonight.

735
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:15,285
Fellow raccoons, I am Tazaburo Hage of Yashima.

736
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:20,359
I am 999 years old.

737
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:28,084
Why is Honshu ravaged by development, while Shikoku is almost untouched?

738
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:33,568
The reason is, we raccoons protect our woods vigilantly.

739
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:43,285
The humans of Shikoku know that disaster will befall them if they anger us.

740
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:52,243
In fact, all three of us are worshipped at every shrine and temple in Shikoku.

741
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:54,930
The humans revere us.

742
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,206
But I have not introduced myself.

743
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:04,849
I am Inugami Gyobu, supreme leader of the raccoons of Matsuyama.

744
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:12,605
I am Kincho VI, direct descendant of the first raccoon master of Kincho Shrine.

745
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:20,406
To frighten the humans of Tokyo and drive them out, we have resolved to carry out Operation Goblin.

746
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:31,847
This operation will require unprecedented powers of mental concentration, concentration so great that the three of us may lose our lives.

747
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:46,366
But if you successfully carry out this plan, you will regain the humans' fear and their respect without fail.

748
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:58,159
And then, you can use the humans' fear and respect of raccoons to put an end to this infernal construction once and for all!

749
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:01,208
We have a full array of potent tricks.

750
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:08,645
We have brought you a boat, oh raccoons, that will ferry all of you back to a lost era of greatness!

751
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:13,446
We promise you: All who come aboard will reach those blessed shores without fail!

752
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:35,120
What a beautiful moon.

753
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,048
We raccoons love moonlit nights.

754
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:44,526
Let us pray to the moon for the success of our enterprise.

755
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:47,164
Right, everybody?

756
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:04,009
The raccoons immediately embarked on a special regimen of training.

757
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:24,958
Congratulations on your nine hundred and ninety-ninth birthday!

758
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:29,179
Thank you everyone!

759
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:31,398
Thank you!

760
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:36,839
Master, please reenact the story of Yoichi the Archer, as you witnessed it in your younger days!

761
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:39,086
So I shall!

762
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:25,678
The time is ripe!

763
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:35,159
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

764
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:41,606
Pom Poko 33, December.

765
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:44,802
The day for Operation Goblin arrived at last.

766
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,659
Slightly cloudy, no wind.

767
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:49,838
Thirteen degrees centigrade, humidity 65% .

768
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:52,006
Perfect conditions for goblins.

769
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:31,724
Transformation into monsters and goblins has always been a raccoon strong point.

770
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:43,770
But now, they needed to draw not only on their own latent energy, but also the hidden energy of the cosmos: Fire, earth, water and air.

771
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:56,843
The intensity of the training undertaken by the raccoons under the tutelage of the three elders of Shikoku is almost beyond description.

772
01:05:56,970 --> 01:06:03,687
All the raccoons, even those who could not shape shift, worked together to focus their combined power.

773
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:11,086
That night, the fighting spirit of the raccoons merged into one consuming flame.

774
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:15,610
Their enthusiasm was so boundless, they transformed themselves into goblins long before they even reached the dwellings of the humans.

775
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:18,124
Long before they even reached the dwellings of the humans.

776
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:24,042
Hey, look at that!

777
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:30,607
What is it?

778
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:38,688
Let the trees burst into full flower!

779
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:49,480
Let the trees burst into full flower!

780
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:09,962
Wow... it's a big parade of goblins!

781
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:14,163
I used to see stuff like that too, way back when.

782
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:17,640
You know, foxes with lanterns, that kind of thing.

783
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:21,365
You can really see them.

784
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,084
You can see the lanterns.

785
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:26,485
With little lights in them.

786
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:30,922
You can see them marching along.

787
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:40,079
I wonder why I could see them?

788
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:43,008
Maybe foxes can really do that.

789
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:45,644
I wonder.

790
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:51,770
You can really see them.

791
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:56,406
It must be your brain playing tricks on you.

792
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,372
A fox wedding.

793
01:09:58,392 --> 01:10:00,264
Foxes with lanterns.

794
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:02,156
It's already in your head.

795
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:05,839
So, it's like...

796
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:08,643
Your brain plays tricks on you.

797
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:11,115
You can see them walking.

798
01:10:11,135 --> 01:10:13,470
It's all in your head.

799
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:18,674
Yeah, you're right.

800
01:10:18,694 --> 01:10:21,108
There's no way it's real.

801
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:25,004
People's brains are scary.

802
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:28,969
You think things, and then you see them.

803
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:32,048
There's no way they could be real, though.

804
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,046
They really are real!

805
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:41,682
It's just your brain playing tricks on you.

806
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:47,843
Welcome home.

807
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:51,278
Sachiko!

808
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:39,399
Matter is void!

809
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:49,964
Form is emptiness!

810
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,398
Here they come again!

811
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:03,079
Master Gyobu!

812
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:04,995
- Master Gyobu!

813
01:13:05,015 --> 01:13:06,150
- Master Gyobu!

814
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:15,448
That was amazing!

815
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:16,844
That was scary, wasn't it?

816
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:22,007
Aw, is that the end?

817
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,599
- That was really cool!

818
01:13:23,619 --> 01:13:25,078
- Yes.

819
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:27,804
Come on, time for bed.

820
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:29,522
Oh, OK...

821
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:34,729
Don't forget to brush your teeth!

822
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:40,523
I feel like I just woke up from a dream.

823
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,199
Me too.

824
01:13:42,219 --> 01:13:43,798
What was all that about, I wonder?

825
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:47,483
After that, flying saucers would seem pretty tame.

826
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:50,325
There are some things you just can't explain.

827
01:13:54,370 --> 01:14:00,282
Long ago, when the Matsuyama clan was at war, Gyobu went over to the enemy, causing the downfall of his clan.

828
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:10,688
He regretted this so deeply that he made a solemn vow to devote the rest of his life fighting for justice.

829
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:21,323
We must ensure his sacrifice was not in vain, emulate his noble spirit, and vow not to rest until the day of victory!

830
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:34,446
Gyahte gyahte hara gyahte A raccoon of Potamochi Mountain Got drunk and transformed himself!

831
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:38,119
Great success to Operation Goblin!

832
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:44,128
The raccoons were so convinced of victory, no one was checking the television for news.

833
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:49,523
Police and the media are searching for anyone who might have videotaped tonight's mysterious parade.

834
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:55,122
But so far no one has come forward, complicating efforts to determine what really happened.

835
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:59,721
I'm sure I was taping the whole thing, but there's nothing on the tape.

836
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:01,562
It doesn't make any sense.

837
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:05,888
The goblin slipped in right through this opening.

838
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:08,196
It was terrifying!

839
01:15:08,216 --> 01:15:10,392
Nobody could have staged that.

840
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:14,886
There really is something strange about New Town after all.

841
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,763
I'd like to move out, but it's not easy.

842
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:20,120
There will be a special program at 12:20 a.m.

843
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:24,402
With in-depth coverage of this evening's strange events.

844
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:46,006
The more people investigate this, the more they will be convinced it was no hallucination, that it all really happened!

845
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:54,159
Then, when they realize their science and logic are powerless to unlock the riddle of what happened...

846
01:15:54,290 --> 01:16:05,087
They'll be dumbfounded by the awesome mystery of the cosmos, and realize how insignificant human existence really is.

847
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:10,000
Listen, everyone: Our good fortune awaits, but let's not wait for it!

848
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:12,405
Come then!

849
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,213
Drink!

850
01:16:14,233 --> 01:16:15,946
Sing!

851
01:16:15,966 --> 01:16:17,679
Dance!

852
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:21,968
Let's hear it for Master Hage!

853
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:28,563
But the next day, events took a totally unexpected turn.

854
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:38,486
It appears that the massive parade staged yesterday in a residential complex of Tama New Town may have been a publicity stunt for Wonderland, a theme park now under construction in the area.

855
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:44,244
Police have summoned PR executives of Wonderland for questioning, on suspicion of having staged a parade without a permit.

856
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:45,405
You gotta be kidding!

857
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:52,128
However, residents of the complex and the surrounding area remain convinced that what they saw yesterday could not have been a publicity stunt.

858
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,842
You can say that again!

859
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:59,128
The president of the company responsible for Wonderland has admitted that the parade was a promotional event.

860
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,569
What?

861
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:09,725
President of Wonderland At Emergency Press Conference I deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused by our parade yesterday.

862
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:11,085
Who the hell is he?

863
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:21,603
We just wanted the world to know how wonderful, ah, Wonderland will be.

864
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:28,846
So we decided the best way was to go out and give the public a free taste of the, ah, wonders they will soon be able to experience at Wonderland.

865
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:37,208
As president of Wonderland, I take full responsibility for the staging of this unauthorized event.

866
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:38,716
- What a liar!

867
01:17:38,736 --> 01:17:39,512
- That's ridiculous!

868
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:49,203
Fortunately, we received an overwhelmingly positive response to our parade.

869
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:55,047
Frankly, we were astonished at the enthusiasm we encountered.

870
01:17:55,170 --> 01:18:04,564
If this humble servant of the theme park going public has to go to jail, the positive reaction we received will make it all worthwhile.

871
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:06,840
- What in the world?!

872
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:07,520
- Is this for real?

873
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:08,276
- What in the world?!

874
01:18:08,296 --> 01:18:09,032
- Is this for real?

875
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:11,286
There's got to be some mistake here!

876
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:15,204
If this humble servant of the theme park going public has to go to jail...

877
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:16,888
That asshole!

878
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:22,641
This new development plunged the raccoons into a state of panic.

879
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:27,966
Meanwhile, Wonderland was desperately searching for the people who staged the parade.

880
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:29,887
It's too late!

881
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:32,843
Beat the bushes if you have to!

882
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:35,319
Just find out who did it and hire them all!

883
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,255
Throw money at them!

884
01:18:37,275 --> 01:18:39,070
I'll pay whatever they want!

885
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:40,762
It was the work of raccoons.

886
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:41,517
What's that?

887
01:18:41,537 --> 01:18:42,154
Raccoons?

888
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,999
I don't care if it was penguins!

889
01:18:45,019 --> 01:18:47,718
I want them all working exclusively for me!

890
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:51,091
Raccoons?

891
01:18:51,111 --> 01:18:51,982
Wait a minute!

892
01:18:52,002 --> 01:18:52,873
What's that supposed to mean?

893
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:55,279
Oh, just a little joke.

894
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:57,237
Who are you?

895
01:18:57,257 --> 01:18:59,114
How did you get in here?

896
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:01,678
Your assistant let me in.

897
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,137
I am Ryutaro.

898
01:19:03,157 --> 01:19:04,474
We spoke on the phone earlier.

899
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,725
This affair is a bit delicate.

900
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:14,840
If you want to work with the people who did this, I'm probably the only one who can deliver them to you.

901
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:17,234
Fine!

902
01:19:17,254 --> 01:19:18,428
I'll pay you 100 million yen.

903
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:25,205
The raccoons were dumbfounded.

904
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,848
This bizarre human had completely stolen their thunder.

905
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:31,643
At first, they railed against the unfairness of it all.

906
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:37,203
But soon, the sheer hopelessness of their situation began to sap their will to fight.

907
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:47,325
Meanwhile, with no footage of Operation Goblin, media coverage petered out and the public rapidly lost interest in the whole affair.

908
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:02,961
You're a fox!

909
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:07,800
Truly, you have a discerning eye.

910
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:11,969
I am Ryutaro, the shape-shifting fox, at your service.

911
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,600
I am honored to meet you, master Kincho.

912
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:19,160
I have heard much about you.

913
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:22,362
I'm nothing more than the sixth in a long line.

914
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:25,323
And what business brings you here?

915
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:28,442
I was astonished by your fabulous parade.

916
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:30,959
At last, someone who understands!

917
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:32,159
How could I not?

918
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:36,203
And you have my deepest sympathies for everything you've had to bear.

919
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,255
I see...

920
01:20:40,275 --> 01:20:43,230
At least someone understands what we're going through.

921
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:47,321
And I was hardly surprised by what happened after the parade.

922
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:49,439
What's that you say?

923
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:52,801
Ryutaro the shape-shifting fox could charm the birds from the trees.

924
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:55,046
He convinced Kincho to come to Ginza.

925
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:58,640
He showed the raccoon into a private room in one of Tokyo's swankiest clubs.

926
01:20:58,730 --> 01:20:59,879
Step right this way.

927
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:03,158
Not to worry!

928
01:21:03,178 --> 01:21:04,796
All my girls are foxes.

929
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:10,607
Do you like them this way?

930
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:12,248
Would foxes suit you better?

931
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:14,725
Or they can be raccoons, if you prefer.

932
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:19,483
I'll get right to the point.

933
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:21,840
There's no future for the raccoons of Tama.

934
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:24,649
They'll die out, just like the foxes.

935
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:27,364
So that's what happened to the foxes of Tama.

936
01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:29,720
Yes, I'm afraid so.

937
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:35,482
The few of us who could shape-shift have to live like this now.

938
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:37,249
Among the humans?!

939
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:40,601
That's the only way to survive in the big city.

940
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:45,968
And that's why I invited you here, to recommend that you raccoons do the same.

941
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:47,762
Now hold on a minute!

942
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:51,240
I know this must come as a shock, but allow me to complete the picture.

943
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:54,643
It's not enough to start over in the human world.

944
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:57,330
If you must swallow poison, drink the whole cup.

945
01:21:57,410 --> 01:22:02,807
The best move would be for you all to go to work for Wonderland, and solve your problem in one go.

946
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:05,258
You can't be serious!

947
01:22:05,278 --> 01:22:07,596
Work for the people who made monkeys of us?

948
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:09,925
Let's think about this calmly.

949
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:12,848
It's time for you raccoons to start living as humans.

950
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:14,807
That's a foregone conclusion.

951
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,524
It takes big money to live like a human!

952
01:22:17,610 --> 01:22:20,124
And how do you make the money you need?

953
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,639
You use the skills you have!

954
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:26,964
And who's going to pay the highest salary?

955
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:30,486
I'm afraid that would be your enemy, Wonderland.

956
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:33,170
They tell me they'll pay generous benefits too.

957
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:38,563
Here's the salary, and these are the benefits.

958
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:43,604
Naturally, I'll be the only one who knows you're raccoons.

959
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:48,999
Bon app
