WHISPER OF THE HEART Shizuku HONNA Yoko Seiji TAKAHASHI Issei Shizuku's Father TACHIBANA Takashi Shizuku's Mother MUROI Shigeru Baron TSUYUGUCHI Shigeru World Emporium' Proprietor KOBAYASHI Keiju - Hello.

2
00:01:15,610 --> 00:02:04,220
- Hot, isn't it?

3
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,240
I'm home.

4
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,990
Thanks.

5
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:18,200
You don't need a bag for just milk!

6
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:19,620
They put it in one.

7
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:21,443
Just say no.

8
00:02:21,463 --> 00:02:23,241
Pour me some too.

9
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:24,790
Dad, want some barley tea?

10
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,590
Please, I'll come there.

11
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,527
- Thanks.

12
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:31,724
The word processor open?

13
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:32,921
- I'm still printing.

14
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,550
I should buy an electronic notebook.

15
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,140
You could've gone to your aunt's too.

16
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,865
No.

17
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:44,890
Onee-chan wears me out.

18
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,150
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.

19
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:49,650
Do you need lunch?

20
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:51,440
No, I'll eat out.

21
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:55,530
The library's busy going to a bar code system.

22
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:58,410
I like the book cards better.

23
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,200
Me too.

24
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:03,660
Hey, this isn't right...

25
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:04,960
What?

26
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,380
Did you leave out a line?

27
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,015
- You're right!

28
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:12,330
- Let me go first.

29
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,130
I have to get this right or my professor will complain.

30
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:20,470
Note: Amasawa Seiji This guy...

31
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,020
You can read, but don't stay up too late.

32
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:24,567
Yeah.

33
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:25,089
Good night.

34
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,370
I thought I'd seen that name before.

35
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,240
Here too.

36
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:52,460
Note: Amasawa Seiji He's taken all these books out before me.

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,060
Amasawa Seiji.

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,740
What's he like?

39
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,420
Is he good-looking?

40
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,295
Shizuku!

41
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:26,860
Get up!

42
00:04:26,905 --> 00:04:28,580
I'm leaving!

43
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,450
Did you sleep in your clothes?

44
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,330
Put the rice on.

45
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,800
Bye!

46
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,480
Oh, no!

47
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,920
I've got to meet Yuko!

48
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,930
My purse!

49
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,650
You ran back upstairs again?

50
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:51,440
Yeah.

51
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,150
That's funny.

52
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,240
Try by the phone...

53
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,240
Found it!

54
00:04:58,275 --> 00:04:59,820
Just where you left it...

55
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,162
I'm late!

56
00:05:01,182 --> 00:05:02,479
Lock the door!

57
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:04,040
Silly!

58
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,000
It's flying so low!

59
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,470
Today's a lucky day!

60
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,660
Is it ever hot!

61
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,435
Yahoo!

62
00:05:58,455 --> 00:05:59,960
How's it going?

63
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,610
Hit it!

64
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:24,280
Hi, Shizuku!

65
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,335
Hi!

66
00:06:26,355 --> 00:06:27,940
Try your best!

67
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,250
Kosaka-sensei, are you there?

68
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,220
Tsukishima?

69
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,490
What are you doing here?

70
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:38,710
Could I ask a favor?

71
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:41,420
Nothing weird, I hope...

72
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:42,828
- Let me in the library!

73
00:06:42,848 --> 00:06:44,211
- What?

74
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:46,850
Can't you wait till school starts?

75
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:50,850
I've read all my books, and the public library's closed.

76
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,770
I'm reading 20 before school starts.

77
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:59,360
Don't forget, you've got high school entrance exams.

78
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:00,992
- Hurry it up!

79
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:02,599
- Here it is!

80
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:04,030
Bring it here.

81
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,040
Give me your card and the book card.

82
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,120
Yes, ma'am.

83
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,710
No one's ever borrowed this book!

84
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,345
It's rare.

85
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:20,200
They don't even have it at the public library.

86
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:31,310
Note: Donated "Amasawa." Sensei!

87
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:34,480
Do you know who this "Amasawa" is?

88
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:37,690
Look what you made me do!

89
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:39,427
Someone gave it to us.

90
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:41,139
I wouldn't know him.

91
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:43,150
Ask an older teacher.

92
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:44,740
Shizuku!

93
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:47,332
What are you doing here?

94
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:49,899
I've been at the front gate since 11!

95
00:07:49,945 --> 00:07:53,750
If I have to stand in the sun, I get more freckles!

96
00:07:53,785 --> 00:07:54,750
S-Sorry!

97
00:07:54,795 --> 00:07:56,632
Relax, Harada.

98
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:58,489
You take freckles much too seriously.

99
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:00,920
They're a serious problem, Sensei!

100
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:03,097
Yeah, yeah.

101
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:05,249
OK, out of here, both of you.

102
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,335
Move up!

103
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:12,130
Move up!

104
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,615
I tried, but it's not going to work.

105
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:18,930
Why not just sing it in English?

106
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:39,240
White clouds spreading up over a hill A road winds up to the town An old house with small windows An old dog waits for me to come home Country road leading far away The road to my old hometown West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain My good old hometown - That's not bad.

107
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:57,590
- Yes, it is.

108
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,900
It's trite.

109
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,060
Yeah?

110
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,820
I wrote another one.

111
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:27,970
Concrete roads, everywhere Cut down all the trees Filled in the valleys Western Tokyo Tama Mountain My hometown is concrete roads What is this?!

112
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,640
But what's this problem?

113
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,760
You don't need the lyrics yet.

114
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:35,583
No.

115
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:37,381
Are you in love with anyone?

116
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:38,770
What?

117
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:42,610
Studying for entrance exams would be easier having someone.

118
00:09:42,645 --> 00:09:44,360
We could encourage each other.

119
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,430
Yuko!

120
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,640
You're in love!

121
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,570
You got a love letter?!

122
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:52,950
Shh!

123
00:09:52,995 --> 00:09:53,700
When?

124
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,425
Who?

125
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:55,150
Is he handsome?

126
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:56,877
He's in another class.

127
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,569
He's not bad.

128
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,258
Meet him, then!

129
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:01,911
If you don't like him, just say no!

130
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:03,130
Yeah, but...

131
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,130
So there's someone else you like!

132
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,145
You can't hide it from me!

133
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:12,920
Confess!

134
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,460
It's Su...

135
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,460
Su...

136
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:18,770
Tsukishima!

137
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:20,560
Bring me my bag, will you?

138
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,405
- Sugimura!

139
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:25,550
- That blue sports bag.

140
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:27,070
Come on, Tsukishima!

141
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,820
Throw it over here.

142
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,860
Shut up and go back to the bench!

143
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:37,740
I'm first-string, and we're through to the regionals!

144
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:38,740
Yuko?

145
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,930
You're in love with Sugimura?

146
00:10:53,975 --> 00:10:56,002
What am I going to do?

147
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,049
The way I reacted, he might know!

148
00:10:58,105 --> 00:10:59,317
Don't worry.

149
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:00,549
He's too dense.

150
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,350
But what about the love letter?

151
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,900
I'll think about it awhile.

152
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:12,070
I see.

153
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,280
At least your parents aren't always after you to study.

154
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:19,120
Silence isn't always great.

155
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:20,660
I wonder...

156
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,635
- Oh, no!

157
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:23,490
- What?

158
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:24,612
I forgot my book!

159
00:11:24,632 --> 00:11:25,699
I'll go back.

160
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:26,920
I'll ride you.

161
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:28,387
No.

162
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:29,829
You'll be late for cram school.

163
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,630
I'll call you.

164
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,630
That book...

165
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,630
Oh, is it yours?

166
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,560
Here, Tsukishima Shizuku.

167
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,560
How do you know my name?

168
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,560
Guess!

169
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,070
My library card.

170
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:35,150
I'd forget about Concrete Road, though.

171
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,080
You read it!

172
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,487
Jerk!

173
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:45,154
Jerk!

174
00:12:45,174 --> 00:12:45,821
Jerk!

175
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,170
Jerk!

176
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,810
Jerk!

177
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,450
Jerk!

178
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,090
Jerk!

179
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,270
"I'd forget about Concrete Road."

180
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,100
Get lost!

181
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,600
I'm home.

182
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,990
Onee-chan?

183
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,220
You're back already?

184
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:57,070
I'm beat!

185
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,160
I got a ride with someone who was coming this way.

186
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,990
Where's Mom?

187
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:05,582
Summer Intensive Seminar.

188
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:07,149
Dad's at work.

189
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,370
You could clean up a little.

190
00:14:10,415 --> 00:14:12,028
- What about dinner?

191
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:13,661
- I'm going to wash the rice.

192
00:14:13,715 --> 00:14:15,177
What's this, Shizuku!

193
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:16,659
The breakfast things are still out!

194
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
I'm getting to it!

195
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,400
Mom's busy!

196
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,840
We've got to help!

197
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,570
Do the rice and put away the washing.

198
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,760
I'll take a shower and make dinner.

199
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,110
Aunt says come see her when you get into high school.

200
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,410
Are you studying?

201
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:47,910
Don't think you can take it easy just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.

202
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:50,410
I know!

203
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,460
She even wanted me to bring home soy sauce!

204
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:56,250
That's your aunt, all right.

205
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,760
It was the same thing last year.

206
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:00,967
Yes!

207
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:02,149
It was miso!

208
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,331
Boy, was it heavy!

209
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,100
Two kilos of it!

210
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,785
Shizuku!

211
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:23,850
Get up and vacuum by your desk!

212
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,530
I'm washing the sheets.

213
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:28,280
And airing the bedding.

214
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,130
- Where's Mom?

215
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,530
- Long gone.

216
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,050
Put that stuff away and bring Dad's lunch to him.

217
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:41,170
Me?!

218
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:42,808
Why not?

219
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:44,421
You're going to the library.

220
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,180
Shall I go instead?

221
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:52,680
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath and the balcony and go to the co-op?

222
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,400
Don't forget to turn the bedding and fix dinner.

223
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,610
I'm going!

224
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,870
Shizuku!

225
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:13,370
Mail these, will you?

226
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,620
What?

227
00:16:14,655 --> 00:16:16,540
M-A-I-L!

228
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,420
You don't have to read them!

229
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:26,930
Take the paper clip off.

230
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:28,122
- Your boyfriend?

231
00:16:28,142 --> 00:16:29,289
- Idiot!

232
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,320
Hey, cat, are you alone?

233
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,330
Where are you going?

234
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,710
What's out there?

235
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,850
Hey!

236
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,830
Answer me!

237
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,695
I get off here.

238
00:17:57,715 --> 00:17:58,590
What about you?

239
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,610
See you.

240
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,695
Hey!

241
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:19,450
A cat!

242
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,100
The library's that way!

243
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:09,260
And it felt just like the start of a story.

244
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,540
There he is!

245
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:27,845
Note: No Entrance What a hill!

246
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:44,260
How far up is he going?

247
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,870
Cat?

248
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,670
Cat?

249
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,420
Does he live around here?

250
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,763
Hey, cat!

251
00:21:47,783 --> 00:21:48,916
Where are you going?

252
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:50,069
Do you live around here?

253
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,900
I never knew there was a place like this way up here.

254
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,890
That's not nice!

255
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,620
Going around teasing dogs!

256
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,140
Maybe you're teasing me too.

257
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,950
I never guessed there was a store like this up here either.

258
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,730
Beautiful doll!

259
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,910
Are you that cat?

260
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,330
- Oh, hello.

261
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,500
- Um...

262
00:24:43,555 --> 00:24:45,557
That's all right.

263
00:24:45,577 --> 00:24:47,579
Look around all you want.

264
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,800
The Baron gets bored.

265
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,980
Is this doll the Baron?

266
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,647
Yep.

267
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,289
Baron Humbert von Jechingen.

268
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:58,931
Quite the name.

269
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,870
Sorry.

270
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,480
- Thanks.

271
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,650
I'm fine now.

272
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,820
- That's a great clock.

273
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:16,027
It was sitting in some castle, all rusted out.

274
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:18,199
Look.

275
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,870
It's beautiful.

276
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,620
What is it?

277
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,140
Wait and see.

278
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,680
What great dwarfs!

279
00:26:13,715 --> 00:26:19,020
So, you're a young lady who knows about dwarfs, are you?

280
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,980
Watch the face... if it works.

281
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,090
A fairy!

282
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,472
The light shines on the glass.

283
00:26:45,492 --> 00:26:46,829
Come up here.

284
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,625
- A princess?

285
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,790
- That's right.

286
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,570
Are they in love?

287
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,475
But they live in different worlds.

288
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,810
He's king of the dwarfs.

289
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,370
Only while the clock is striking 12 she is changed back from a sheep.

290
00:27:17,405 --> 00:27:23,120
But he appears every hour and waits for her.

291
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:28,960
The artisan who made this must have been disappointed in love.

292
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,380
That's why they both look so sad.

293
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,970
This clock's fast, isn't it?

294
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:42,100
Only about five minutes, though.

295
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:43,060
Oh, no!

296
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,240
I've got to be at the library!

297
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,550
Goodbye.

298
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,860
Can I come back sometime?

299
00:27:49,895 --> 00:27:53,240
Sure, but go left to get to the library!

300
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,080
I'm right above it!

301
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,250
What a find!

302
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,000
A place where stories start!

303
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,430
Fantastic!

304
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,600
Tsukishima!

305
00:28:22,635 --> 00:28:24,480
Tsukishima Shizuku!

306
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,610
Isn't this yours?

307
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,110
Forgetful, aren't you.

308
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:38,123
- Thanks, but how?

309
00:28:38,143 --> 00:28:40,111
- Guess!

310
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,800
The cat.

311
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,240
Is that your cat?

312
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,130
You sure eat a big lunch!

313
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,420
No!

314
00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:55,510
Concrete roads, everywhere...

315
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,230
It's not mine!

316
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,420
Hey!

317
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,140
Oh, here you are.

318
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,850
What's wrong with you?

319
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,270
It's hard to explain.

320
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,030
I felt like I'd found a treasure hidden in a cave.

321
00:29:15,065 --> 00:29:17,990
Then what someone said buried me alive.

322
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:19,990
Sounds complicated.

323
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,590
- Getting more books?

324
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,650
- Seven more to go.

325
00:29:26,705 --> 00:29:27,940
- Still at it?

326
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,195
What about lunch?

327
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:30,450
- I'll buy something.

328
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:31,677
You will?

329
00:29:31,697 --> 00:29:32,869
Thanks, then.

330
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,690
June 16th...

331
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,105
Wow!

332
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:00,770
Amasawa's read this one too!

333
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,990
What's he like?

334
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,405
No!

335
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:09,530
He's not you!

336
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,900
Shizuku!

337
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,090
Hurry!

338
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,890
I'm late!

339
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,600
Pass my umbrella.

340
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,400
Rain every day this term!

341
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,030
At least you're studying because you want to.

342
00:31:21,065 --> 00:31:22,280
Sorry.

343
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:24,070
Study hard!

344
00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:25,490
Don't you worry!

345
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,385
- Shizuku!

346
00:31:34,405 --> 00:31:35,450
- Hi!

347
00:31:35,505 --> 00:31:36,237
Hurry!

348
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:36,989
We'll be late!

349
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,605
- I hate all these tests!

350
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:42,670
- One every day!

351
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,255
- Did you answer?

352
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:50,510
- No.

353
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:51,810
Did he say anything?

354
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,940
I'm going to say no.

355
00:31:54,985 --> 00:31:56,513
Yeah?

356
00:31:56,533 --> 00:31:58,061
Maybe that's best.

357
00:31:58,105 --> 00:31:59,530
Sugimura!

358
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,530
Better hurry!

359
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,740
I know!

360
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,300
Time's up.

361
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,490
Gather the papers.

362
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,470
See you this afternoon.

363
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,720
Let's go see Kosaka-sensei.

364
00:32:30,755 --> 00:32:32,640
Let me go to the teachers' room first.

365
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:34,020
Sure.

366
00:32:34,065 --> 00:32:35,067
- Tsukishima!

367
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,089
- What?

368
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:38,400
I lucked out on the test!

369
00:32:38,435 --> 00:32:39,900
Isn't that nice.

370
00:32:39,935 --> 00:32:42,900
Everything I studied was on it!

371
00:32:42,935 --> 00:32:45,450
So, you're not just a baseball goof.

372
00:32:45,495 --> 00:32:47,582
Yuko's good at guessing too.

373
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:49,689
Why not study with her?

374
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,080
With Harada?

375
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,172
- Hey, Sugimura!

376
00:32:52,192 --> 00:32:53,239
- What?

377
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,540
Come on!

378
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,120
Stop fixing me up!

379
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:04,260
Was it obvious?

380
00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:06,390
I never just guess!

381
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:07,510
Sorry!

382
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,430
Excuse me.

383
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,595
A library book donor?

384
00:33:15,615 --> 00:33:17,330
Gee, I don't know.

385
00:33:17,385 --> 00:33:19,228
Sorry to bother you at lunchtime.

386
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:21,091
There's this stamp in it.

387
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,870
Oh...

388
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,235
That's Dr.

389
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:29,070
Amasawa.

390
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,127
I've read it.

391
00:33:30,147 --> 00:33:31,149
It's a good book!

392
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,580
Yes, very.

393
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,650
What kind of person is he?

394
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,130
He was chairman of the PTA a few years ago.

395
00:33:40,175 --> 00:33:42,088
The PTA?

396
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:44,021
Would you know his given name?

397
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:45,830
His given name?

398
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:48,123
Kimura-sensei, do you remember that Dr.

399
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:50,391
Amasawa's given name?

400
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,693
Dr.

401
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:52,961
Amasawa?

402
00:33:52,981 --> 00:33:54,229
It was Koichi, Amasawa Koichi.

403
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:55,680
Amasawa Koichi.

404
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,870
His youngest son's in your year, Tsukishima.

405
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,640
You don't know him?

406
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:03,650
He is?!

407
00:34:03,695 --> 00:34:04,623
Umm...

408
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:05,571
Thank you very much!

409
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,320
Goodbye!

410
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,620
Sorry!

411
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,620
Shizuku, where are you going?

412
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,930
What a surprise!

413
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:20,630
Tell me about it!

414
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,700
What's with you?!

415
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,900
Sorry!

416
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,680
Hey, where are you going?

417
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,425
He ignored me!

418
00:34:55,445 --> 00:34:56,560
Of all the nerve!

419
00:34:56,615 --> 00:34:58,063
Who is he?

420
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,531
Where are you going?

421
00:34:59,585 --> 00:35:01,047
He's a jerk!

422
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:02,529
He won't make me avoid him!

423
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,760
I've been carrying her lunch all over.

424
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,720
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?

425
00:35:12,755 --> 00:35:17,180
Looks like springtime has come for Shizuku at last!

426
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,350
It isn't true!

427
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:22,310
You met a prince from one of your books?

428
00:35:22,345 --> 00:35:23,480
Is he handsome?

429
00:35:23,515 --> 00:35:26,150
I just want to find out what he's like!

430
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:28,242
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.

431
00:35:28,262 --> 00:35:30,309
Tell us!

432
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,360
Yuko!

433
00:35:32,395 --> 00:35:34,200
It happened too fast.

434
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:38,200
"Ma," something, "Masaki," maybe...

435
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:39,910
Right, Shizuku?

436
00:35:39,945 --> 00:35:41,080
Dunno...

437
00:35:41,115 --> 00:35:46,130
But it's like Tsukishima to run out without hearing the end of something.

438
00:35:46,165 --> 00:35:48,670
You want to know, but you don't.

439
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,840
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!

440
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:56,100
How terribly romantic!

441
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:02,390
Should you really tease a girl who has just written your lyric?

442
00:36:02,435 --> 00:36:03,297
- You finished?!

443
00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:04,179
- Let's see!

444
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,680
Oh, Shizuku-sama!

445
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,140
Oh, great poet!

446
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,600
We will not transgress again!

447
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,950
All right, then.

448
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,870
I'm not sure...

449
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,620
I don't know about old hometowns, so I wrote about what I feel.

450
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:24,750
This is great!

451
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:36,730
Country road, this old road If I go right to the end Got a feeling it'll take me To that town, country road This is good, Shizuku.

452
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:48,390
I like it.

453
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,690
It's not hard to sing?

454
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:51,940
We'll manage.

455
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:56,160
We can give this to the juniors and sing it at the teachers' thank you!

456
00:36:56,195 --> 00:36:57,450
There too?!

457
00:36:57,495 --> 00:36:58,917
- Slow down!

458
00:36:58,937 --> 00:37:00,359
- I like this part.

459
00:37:00,405 --> 00:37:04,370
"I left because I was alone and I had nothing.

460
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:08,580
Pushed away my sadness and pretended I was strong..."

461
00:37:08,615 --> 00:37:10,630
Ladies, the bell.

462
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,970
The sun's come out!

463
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,470
Shizuku!

464
00:37:22,515 --> 00:37:24,647
Come to the choir room!

465
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,799
We'll show them your lyrics.

466
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:29,230
No, I'm going to the library.

467
00:37:29,265 --> 00:37:31,360
There's another test tomorrow.

468
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,100
- I'll study there.

469
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,350
- Bookworm!

470
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,710
- Later.

471
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,440
- Bye-bye.

472
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,730
Harada.

473
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,240
Can I talk to you for a minute?

474
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,540
It's closed.

475
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,340
Have these flowers been watered?

476
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,990
Baron's gone.

477
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,930
Maybe someone bought him.

478
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,320
Note: World Emporium; Nishi Shiro, Prop.

479
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,210
Nishi Shiro.

480
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,320
Maybe that jerk's name is Nishi too.

481
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,040
Shizuku!

482
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,460
Shizuku!

483
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,220
Yuko-chan's on the phone!

484
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,940
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.

485
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,100
Yuko?

486
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,825
What?

487
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:36,060
I can't hear you.

488
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,650
I'll be there in a minute.

489
00:39:39,685 --> 00:39:41,700
Bye.

490
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,480
- Where are you going?

491
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,560
- Not far.

492
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,170
What's wrong?

493
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,475
- Shizuku!

494
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:56,830
- What's the matter?

495
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,340
What's with this face?

496
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:00,550
What am I going to do?!

497
00:40:00,585 --> 00:40:06,260
The guy who wrote the letter got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!

498
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,190
Huh?

499
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,380
That's bad.

500
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,270
Why you, of all people?!

501
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,190
Hey!

502
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,990
That guy is so dense!

503
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,950
But he doesn't know how you feel about him.

504
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,790
I'll apologize to him.

505
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:36,880
But I can't go to school tomorrow looking like this.

506
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:38,130
And miss the test?

507
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,590
Yeah.

508
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,010
I see.

509
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,530
Idiot!

510
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,070
What?

511
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,620
It was easy.

512
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:11,700
The library again, Shizuku?

513
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:12,950
I'm going to Yuko's.

514
00:41:12,995 --> 00:41:13,918
I see.

515
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:14,861
Say hello to her.

516
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,300
Tsukishima!

517
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,800
Wait up!

518
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,390
About Harada...

519
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,185
And then she started crying.

520
00:41:46,205 --> 00:41:48,810
Did I say something wrong?

521
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,160
She said, "Why you, of all people," didn't she?

522
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,240
Yeah.

523
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,700
A guy on the baseball team asked me.

524
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,960
No!

525
00:42:00,995 --> 00:42:04,050
She didn't want to hear something like that from you!

526
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:05,420
Don't you understand?!

527
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,760
No, I don't!

528
00:42:07,795 --> 00:42:08,880
Tell me!

529
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,945
You really are dense, you know!

530
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:14,260
She likes you!

531
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,980
What?!

532
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,120
No way!

533
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,260
I don't need this!

534
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,480
You don't?

535
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,120
How do you think Yuko feels?

536
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,760
She stayed home sick today!

537
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,290
But...

538
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,190
I like you!

539
00:42:28,235 --> 00:42:29,780
What?

540
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,950
Don't make jokes at a time like this!

541
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:34,503
It's not a joke!

542
00:42:34,523 --> 00:42:36,031
I've liked you for a long time!

543
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,675
Not me!

544
00:42:38,695 --> 00:42:40,070
You can't!

545
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,970
You don't like me?

546
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,370
Or do you have a boyfriend?

547
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,170
I don't have a boyfriend.

548
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,340
But...

549
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,770
- I'm sorry!

550
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,540
- Wait!

551
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,050
Tell me the truth!

552
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:56,800
But we've always been friends...

553
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,970
I like you, but not...

554
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,805
I'm sorry.

555
00:43:03,825 --> 00:43:04,930
I can't say what I mean.

556
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,950
Just friends?

557
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,200
Forever?

558
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,210
I see.

559
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,010
I'm the one who's dense.

560
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,860
Miss, the parcel delivery left this with me.

561
00:44:27,895 --> 00:44:30,230
Thank you again.

562
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,920
You don't have to do this.

563
00:44:46,955 --> 00:44:49,380
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.

564
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:51,510
Oh, you're home.

565
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,880
Shizuku?

566
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,130
Hi.

567
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,970
Have you been shut out too?

568
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,360
Do you live here?

569
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,170
Are you hungry?

570
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,430
You're not very nice.

571
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:34,180
Just like me.

572
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:39,520
Why do we change, I wonder?

573
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,190
I was always so sweet.

574
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:46,700
Books don't even excite me like they used to.

575
00:46:46,735 --> 00:46:52,170
There's always someone inside me saying, "Things aren't that easy."

576
00:46:52,205 --> 00:46:53,880
I'm not very nice.

577
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,125
Hey!

578
00:47:20,145 --> 00:47:20,980
Tsukishima!

579
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,950
Moon lets you pet him?

580
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,620
Moon, you're not coming in?

581
00:47:27,655 --> 00:47:29,290
Is that his name?

582
00:47:29,325 --> 00:47:31,370
He's like a full moon.

583
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,040
That's why I call him that.

584
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,550
Isn't he yours?

585
00:47:40,585 --> 00:47:42,470
He won't stay in one house.

586
00:47:42,505 --> 00:47:46,010
I heard him being called Ball at one place.

587
00:47:46,045 --> 00:47:48,310
I'm sure there's others.

588
00:47:48,345 --> 00:47:50,980
So he does the rounds.

589
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,905
Yes!

590
00:47:53,925 --> 00:47:55,470
He commutes, on the train!

591
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:56,980
The train?

592
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:58,877
Yes, by himself!

593
00:47:58,897 --> 00:48:00,324
That's how I came here.

594
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:01,771
I followed him.

595
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,780
And he brought me to a neat store, just like out of a story.

596
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:09,910
I insulted him.

597
00:48:09,955 --> 00:48:12,107
I said he wasn't very nice.

598
00:48:12,127 --> 00:48:14,279
Just like me.

599
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,130
You're not like Moon at all!

600
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,800
He's half-devil...

601
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,425
- Um...

602
00:48:30,445 --> 00:48:31,050
- Would you?

603
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:35,615
Is your grandfather all right?

604
00:48:35,635 --> 00:48:37,720
The store's been closed and I thought...

605
00:48:37,775 --> 00:48:39,107
He's fine.

606
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:40,459
It's a weird store.

607
00:48:40,479 --> 00:48:41,811
He doesn't open very often.

608
00:48:41,855 --> 00:48:43,820
I'm glad he's all right.

609
00:48:43,865 --> 00:48:45,852
I can't see Baron through the window.

610
00:48:45,872 --> 00:48:47,859
Did he sell him?

611
00:48:47,915 --> 00:48:48,910
That cat doll?

612
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:49,925
You want to see it?

613
00:48:49,945 --> 00:48:50,940
Come on.

614
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:02,720
Close the door.

615
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,320
It's like we're in the sky!

616
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,210
Afraid of heights?

617
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:36,632
No, I like high places.

618
00:49:36,652 --> 00:49:38,029
This is great.

619
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,435
This is the time it looks best.

620
00:49:46,455 --> 00:49:48,000
In here.

621
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,910
Perfect timing.

622
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,410
Sit there.

623
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:16,410
The clock's gone!

624
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,080
The one that was there?

625
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,920
Grandpa's delivering it today.

626
00:50:22,955 --> 00:50:24,050
Did he sell it?

627
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,920
It was here being fixed.

628
00:50:26,955 --> 00:50:30,050
I wanted to see it again.

629
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:32,043
It took three years.

630
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,011
He finished it the day you forgot your lunch.

631
00:50:34,055 --> 00:50:35,560
That lunch!

632
00:50:35,595 --> 00:50:38,480
I know it wasn't yours.

633
00:50:38,515 --> 00:50:40,150
Look into the cat's eyes.

634
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:45,480
Quick, before the light goes.

635
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:01,210
Engelzimmer: "angel's room."

636
00:51:01,245 --> 00:51:04,590
The artisan accidentally scratched it with a cloth.

637
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:06,460
It's beautiful.

638
00:51:06,505 --> 00:51:07,973
The Baron won't go.

639
00:51:07,993 --> 00:51:09,461
He's a treasure.

640
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:11,090
A treasure?

641
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:14,630
It means something to him.

642
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,670
He won't say what, though.

643
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:18,318
Look as long as you like.

644
00:51:18,338 --> 00:51:19,931
I'll be downstairs.

645
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,900
Turn on the light if you want.

646
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:41,740
It's weird.

647
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,410
I feel as if I've known you for years.

648
00:51:44,455 --> 00:51:46,710
Sometimes I really want to see you.

649
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:54,100
You look sad today, somehow.

650
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:57,983
- Had enough?

651
00:52:58,003 --> 00:52:59,276
- Yeah.

652
00:52:59,296 --> 00:53:00,569
Thanks.

653
00:53:00,615 --> 00:53:03,250
Are you making a violin?

654
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,370
Uh, yeah.

655
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,040
Can I see?

656
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,130
It fits like this.

657
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,065
You made all that?

658
00:53:17,085 --> 00:53:18,380
By hand?

659
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,400
- Sure!

660
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,010
- Amazing!

661
00:53:22,055 --> 00:53:25,440
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.

662
00:53:25,475 --> 00:53:28,650
The sound comes from the craftsman's skill.

663
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,320
You made all those?

664
00:53:32,365 --> 00:53:34,202
No way!

665
00:53:34,222 --> 00:53:36,059
There's a violin-making class here.

666
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,190
- But one of them is yours?

667
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:39,690
- Yeah.

668
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,860
- Which one?

669
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,400
- That one.

670
00:53:43,445 --> 00:53:45,290
This one?

671
00:53:45,335 --> 00:53:46,957
Wow!

672
00:53:46,977 --> 00:53:48,599
You made this?

673
00:53:48,619 --> 00:53:50,241
It's like magic!

674
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,420
How can you talk like that with a straight face?

675
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,565
Why?

676
00:53:56,585 --> 00:53:57,920
It's what I think.

677
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,760
Anyone can do that.

678
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,680
I've got a long way to go.

679
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,320
You can play, can't you?

680
00:54:13,355 --> 00:54:14,440
A little.

681
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:15,743
Play for me, OK?

682
00:54:15,763 --> 00:54:17,021
Please!

683
00:54:17,065 --> 00:54:18,450
Listen...

684
00:54:18,485 --> 00:54:20,700
Please, please, please!

685
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,580
You have to sing too.

686
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,175
Me?

687
00:54:26,195 --> 00:54:27,410
I'm tone-deaf!

688
00:54:27,455 --> 00:54:29,000
Perfect!

689
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,570
Sing.

690
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:47,760
You know this song.

691
00:55:11,830 --> 00:57:38,980
Had a dream of living on my own With no fear of being all alone Pushed my sadness down inside of me And pretended I was strong as I could be Country road, this old road If you go right to the end Got a feeling it'll take me To that town, country road It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be I will never ever let a tear show in my eye If my feet are moving faster that's because I only want to Push away memories Country road, this old road Could go right to my hometown I won't go there, I can't go there Can't go down that country road Country road, when tomorrow comes I'll be like I always am Want to go back there Can't go back there Fare thee well Country road That was fun!

692
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,620
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.

693
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,560
We met the other day.

694
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:51,240
I was hoping you'd come back again.

695
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:54,330
These are my musical friends.

696
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,830
Nice singing.

697
00:57:56,865 --> 00:58:00,630
You're the lucky one who was there when he fixed the clock.

698
00:58:00,665 --> 00:58:03,630
Seiji-kun has some pretty friends.

699
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,250
Seiji?

700
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:08,920
Are you Amasawa Seiji?

701
00:58:08,975 --> 00:58:10,687
Yeah.

702
00:58:10,707 --> 00:58:12,419
Didn't I tell you my name?

703
00:58:12,475 --> 00:58:14,042
No!

704
00:58:14,062 --> 00:58:15,629
It says Nishi outside.

705
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,365
That's Grandpa's name.

706
00:58:18,385 --> 00:58:20,140
I'm Amasawa.

707
00:58:20,195 --> 00:58:22,827
Oh, no!

708
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:25,479
First I was buried alive, and now the sky's fallen in!

709
00:58:25,525 --> 00:58:29,280
What difference does it make what my name is?

710
00:58:29,325 --> 00:58:31,122
A lot!

711
00:58:31,142 --> 00:58:32,939
You've been calling me by my full name!

712
00:58:32,985 --> 00:58:35,250
You never asked me mine!

713
00:58:35,285 --> 00:58:36,960
I never had the chance!

714
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,960
My image of Amasawa Seiji...

715
00:58:40,995 --> 00:58:42,130
What?

716
00:58:42,165 --> 00:58:44,170
...was someone quiet and gentle.

717
00:58:44,205 --> 00:58:46,420
You read too many books.

718
00:58:46,455 --> 00:58:48,470
So do you!

719
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:05,890
That was fun.

720
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:07,350
They're nice people.

721
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:09,205
Come back.

722
00:59:09,225 --> 00:59:10,520
They'll like that.

723
00:59:10,575 --> 00:59:11,978
Just to listen.

724
00:59:11,998 --> 00:59:13,401
Singing's too hard.

725
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,195
But you're a good violinist.

726
00:59:16,215 --> 00:59:18,110
Is that what you want to do?

727
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,330
There's lots as good as me.

728
00:59:21,365 --> 00:59:24,500
What I want to do is make violins.

729
00:59:24,545 --> 00:59:25,823
Yeah.

730
00:59:25,843 --> 00:59:27,121
You're good at that.

731
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,260
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.

732
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,140
I want to go there.

733
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:36,640
And not go to high school?

734
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:40,175
My parents are dead against it.

735
00:59:40,195 --> 00:59:43,140
Grandpa's my only ally.

736
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,330
It must be great to know what you want to do.

737
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,285
I've got no idea at all.

738
01:00:01,305 --> 01:00:03,620
I just go from one day to the next.

739
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,580
I don't know if I can go or not.

740
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,960
I fight with my parents every day.

741
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:14,680
Even if I go, I won't know if I have the talent until I try.

742
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,430
I'll see you home.

743
01:00:19,475 --> 01:00:20,878
No, it's not far.

744
01:00:20,898 --> 01:00:22,301
See you.

745
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,190
Tsukishima...

746
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,190
Yeah?

747
01:00:27,225 --> 01:00:29,240
You've got a talent for poetry.

748
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:34,450
What you sang back there was fine, but I liked Concrete Roads too.

749
01:00:34,485 --> 01:00:37,290
You told me to forget that!

750
01:00:37,335 --> 01:00:38,732
- Did I say that?

751
01:00:38,752 --> 01:00:40,149
- Yes!

752
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:41,910
I did?

753
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,155
Thanks for everything.

754
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:46,450
Good night.

755
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:09,650
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.

756
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:19,660
When did you decide on your future?

757
01:01:19,695 --> 01:01:20,910
What?

758
01:01:20,945 --> 01:01:22,250
Your future!

759
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:25,120
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?

760
01:01:25,155 --> 01:01:27,000
I don't mean that!

761
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:30,090
I'm at university finding that out.

762
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,300
Good night.

763
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,800
Good night.

764
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,740
Mom's class is canceled, so now she sleeps in!

765
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,590
- Morning!

766
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:04,740
- Morning!

767
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:07,170
Run faster!

768
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,040
You go ahead!

769
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:28,730
Note: Hour 1: Spare Period Great!

770
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,070
Shizuku!

771
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,940
You look awful!

772
01:02:32,975 --> 01:02:35,900
You sure got better fast!

773
01:02:35,935 --> 01:02:38,660
I hear you were out with a boy last night.

774
01:02:38,695 --> 01:02:40,780
Who told you that?!

775
01:02:40,815 --> 01:02:43,790
A little bird who said you were like lovers.

776
01:02:43,825 --> 01:02:45,000
We are not!

777
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:55,330
Harada, I'll tell my friend the answer's no.

778
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:57,370
Sorry.

779
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,390
I'm sorry too.

780
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,850
That's OK.

781
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:08,340
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?

782
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,090
It was great!

783
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:21,530
This formula will be on the midterm, so remember it!

784
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:24,490
That's all!

785
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:47,480
Is Tsukishima here?

786
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:49,320
Amasawa?

787
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:50,130
What do you want?

788
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:52,310
Is Tsukishima in this class?

789
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,430
Tsukishima?

790
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:55,720
Yeah, she's here.

791
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:57,495
Tsukishima!

792
01:03:57,515 --> 01:03:58,680
You've got a visitor!

793
01:03:58,725 --> 01:03:59,530
A male!

794
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:05,990
There she is.

795
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,620
Seiji-kun?

796
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:12,170
Can I talk to you?

797
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:14,590
Yes!

798
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:17,710
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!

799
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:23,890
No, I don't!

800
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,480
What is it?

801
01:04:32,525 --> 01:04:34,178
- I'm going to Italy.

802
01:04:34,198 --> 01:04:35,851
- What?

803
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:37,820
Come with me.

804
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,250
- Where are we going?

805
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:44,360
- The roof!

806
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:53,920
Wow!

807
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:58,460
We can't talk with all those people around.

808
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:00,475
Sorry.

809
01:05:00,495 --> 01:05:02,120
I wanted to tell you first.

810
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:08,140
Let them think what they want.

811
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:10,545
My dad finally gave in.

812
01:05:10,565 --> 01:05:12,380
On one condition.

813
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,400
What's that?

814
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:19,570
I apprentice in a workshop there for two months.

815
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:21,690
Apprentice?

816
01:05:21,735 --> 01:05:24,057
The guy who runs it is very strict.

817
01:05:24,077 --> 01:05:26,399
He'll see if I have talent or not.

818
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:30,410
Also if I have the patience to stick it out.

819
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:33,540
Otherwise I go to high school.

820
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:37,460
I hate that they're leaving an escape route...

821
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:39,420
...but it's a good chance.

822
01:05:39,455 --> 01:05:41,050
When do you go?

823
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,750
As soon as I get my passport.

824
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:45,920
Dad's talking to the school today.

825
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:47,760
Soon then.

826
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,525
Great!

827
01:05:50,545 --> 01:05:51,630
Your dream's coming true.

828
01:05:51,675 --> 01:05:54,730
Well, I'll do the best I can.

829
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:57,805
- Um...

830
01:05:57,825 --> 01:05:58,350
- Well...

831
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:02,625
- The rain's stopping.

832
01:06:02,645 --> 01:06:03,940
- Yeah.

833
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,450
Look over there.

834
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:13,960
There might be a rainbow.

835
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,770
What's Cremona like?

836
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:30,170
I hope it's nice.

837
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:36,190
It's an old town, with lots of violin makers.

838
01:06:36,235 --> 01:06:38,052
It's great.

839
01:06:38,072 --> 01:06:39,889
You're on your way.

840
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,650
I feel like a fool.

841
01:06:42,685 --> 01:06:46,030
I was hoping we'd go to the same high school.

842
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,950
What a stupid thing to think.

843
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:12,010
I saw your name on the library cards a long time ago.

844
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:16,390
We passed each other in the library.

845
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:20,020
I even sat beside you there.

846
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,860
I read all kinds of books so my name would be on the cards before yours.

847
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,030
I...

848
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,950
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.

849
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:40,920
Me too.

850
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,670
Don't push!

851
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:52,600
Hey!

852
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,220
Look out, she's mad!

853
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:00,520
Run!

854
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,485
- Here.

855
01:08:35,505 --> 01:08:36,130
- Thanks.

856
01:08:36,175 --> 01:08:37,220
Excuse me.

857
01:08:37,255 --> 01:08:40,060
Finished already?

858
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:42,440
I'm meeting Yuko.

859
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:47,730
If you're by the station, get some milk.

860
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:52,200
You're the one who drinks it all!

861
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:55,410
She's slacking off these days.

862
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:17,170
- Did I make you skip cram school?

863
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:18,670
- It's OK.

864
01:09:18,715 --> 01:09:20,430
My head's in a whirl.

865
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,800
- Hello, Shizuku-chan.

866
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,220
- Hello.

867
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,600
- Welcome back.

868
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:30,020
- Hello.

869
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:34,160
I'll make some tea.

870
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:38,780
Dad and I aren't speaking.

871
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:47,630
Boys are so lucky!

872
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:55,010
When he comes back to graduate, he goes again for ten years!

873
01:09:55,045 --> 01:09:57,220
That's like forever!

874
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:00,110
But it's like fate brought you together!

875
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,050
Cool!

876
01:10:02,105 --> 01:10:06,402
It's too good to last.

877
01:10:06,422 --> 01:10:10,719
Two people read the same books, except one's going forward while the other stays behind.

878
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:12,900
Yeah.

879
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:17,320
Kinu-chan was in his class for a year.

880
01:10:17,355 --> 01:10:21,790
She said he was hard to get to know, but good-looking and smart.

881
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:26,370
Don't tell me that, will you!

882
01:10:26,405 --> 01:10:27,750
I just feel worse!

883
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,477
Why?

884
01:10:29,497 --> 01:10:30,674
He likes you, doesn't he?

885
01:10:30,694 --> 01:10:31,871
He told you!

886
01:10:31,915 --> 01:10:33,880
Now I'm not so sure.

887
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,013
I don't get it.

888
01:10:39,033 --> 01:10:40,946
I'd write every day.

889
01:10:40,966 --> 01:10:42,879
We'd encourage each other.

890
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:47,900
You can't say "Go for it" to someone more ambitious than you.

891
01:10:47,935 --> 01:10:49,520
Maybe...

892
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:54,490
But I don't understand what you want.

893
01:10:54,525 --> 01:10:57,740
Can't you be in love without your future planned out?

894
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,330
You have talent.

895
01:11:02,365 --> 01:11:05,870
All the juniors liked your translation of Country Roads.

896
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:09,790
You can express yourself too, unlike me.

897
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:14,510
"There's lots as good as me."

898
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:17,090
That's what he said.

899
01:11:17,135 --> 01:11:19,057
He's going to find out if he has talent.

900
01:11:19,077 --> 01:11:20,999
Well, so will I!

901
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:26,390
I'll write a story!

902
01:11:26,435 --> 01:11:28,173
There's one I want to write.

903
01:11:28,193 --> 01:11:29,931
If he can do it, so can I.

904
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:32,820
But it's exam time.

905
01:11:32,865 --> 01:11:34,167
I don't care.

906
01:11:34,187 --> 01:11:35,489
Thanks, Yuko.

907
01:11:35,509 --> 01:11:36,811
I feel empowered.

908
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:38,020
- You going?

909
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:38,730
- Yeah.

910
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:43,910
Good night.

911
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:46,290
Tell your mother hello.

912
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,540
You go for it too.

913
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,285
Sugimura will realize.

914
01:11:55,305 --> 01:11:57,370
Bye.

915
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,840
Bye.

916
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:02,880
It's so easy!

917
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,840
I just have to do something too!

918
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:10,020
Moon?

919
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,230
Muta?

920
01:12:16,275 --> 01:12:17,868
Mom!

921
01:12:17,888 --> 01:12:19,481
Muta's gone again!

922
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,070
Muta!

923
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:23,320
Muta...

924
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:31,920
Note: 'Whisper of the Heart': Listen to the voice of the woods...

925
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:59,360
The Baron as the hero?

926
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:01,700
Would you mind?

927
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:07,030
I ask because Seiji-kun says the doll is a treasure of yours.

928
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,370
You didn't have to ask.

929
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:12,805
Of course you can.

930
01:13:12,825 --> 01:13:14,620
But on one condition.

931
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,090
Yes?

932
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:22,380
That you let me be the first person to read your story.

933
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,300
Um...

934
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:26,550
All right?

935
01:13:26,595 --> 01:13:29,102
Do I have to?

936
01:13:29,122 --> 01:13:31,629
I don't know if I can write it or not.

937
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,440
It's the same for a craftsman.

938
01:13:37,475 --> 01:13:40,740
Don't expect perfection at first.

939
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,700
Here, let me show you something.

940
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:51,620
This.

941
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:57,130
Look at it.

942
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,140
It's called mica slate.

943
01:14:08,175 --> 01:14:10,470
Look at the seam.

944
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:12,730
Like that.

945
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:25,360
It's beautiful!

946
01:14:25,405 --> 01:14:27,767
It's called beryl.

947
01:14:27,787 --> 01:14:30,149
You find it in emerald ore.

948
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:31,693
- Emerald?

949
01:14:31,713 --> 01:14:32,736
The jewel?

950
01:14:32,756 --> 01:14:33,779
- Yes.

951
01:14:33,825 --> 01:14:37,040
You and Seiji are like this stone.

952
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:40,500
Rough, unpolished, still natural.

953
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,300
I like stones that way.

954
01:14:44,335 --> 01:14:48,840
But making violins or writing stories is different.

955
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:52,130
The rough stone is inside you.

956
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:54,380
You have to find it and then polish it.

957
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,100
It takes time and effort.

958
01:14:57,690 --> 01:15:01,070
You see the ore that makes up most of that stone?

959
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:02,820
Yes.

960
01:15:02,855 --> 01:15:07,820
You could polish that, but what you'd get would be worthless.

961
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,580
The smaller part inside is purer.

962
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:17,580
There might even be a better stone deep inside where we can't see.

963
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:19,672
I'm sorry.

964
01:15:19,692 --> 01:15:21,739
Old people like to preach.

965
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,765
I'm scared.

966
01:15:25,785 --> 01:15:27,870
What if there isn't a beautiful crystal in me?

967
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:30,980
But I want to write.

968
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,130
And you'll be the first one to see it.

969
01:15:33,185 --> 01:15:34,522
Thank you.

970
01:15:34,542 --> 01:15:35,879
I'll look forward to it.

971
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:48,400
A rough stone... lapis lazuli...

972
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:58,370
Let us go forth together in search of the treasure of lapis lazuli!

973
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:01,930
Have no fear.

974
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:03,830
Space is deformed on the night of the new moon.

975
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:11,180
Faraway things loom large, nearby things look small.

976
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:16,150
Fly!

977
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:17,670
We will rise on the updraft.

978
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:25,055
Make haste!

979
01:16:25,075 --> 01:16:26,720
The planetoids converge!

980
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,300
Good!

981
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,320
We're riding the wind!

982
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,790
Straight up to that castle!

983
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:47,210
It's so high!

984
01:16:47,245 --> 01:16:50,050
It's not so high once you're there!

985
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:13,740
When the air currents mingle in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!

986
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:16,740
Huh?

987
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:23,575
That's rare.

988
01:17:23,595 --> 01:17:26,200
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...

989
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,090
He's making a violin in his cell.

990
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,500
Seiji-kun!

991
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:45,790
I thought you'd gone!

992
01:18:45,825 --> 01:18:48,630
Grandpa said I might find you here.

993
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,140
Glad I met you before.

994
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,410
I leave tomorrow.

995
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:54,260
Tomorrow...

996
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:58,395
Don't worry.

997
01:18:58,415 --> 01:19:00,460
I'll wait here till you're done.

998
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,920
Sorry I can't walk you home.

999
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,700
That's OK.

1000
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,120
I'm glad you came.

1001
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,970
I can't come to the airport, but I'll wait for you.

1002
01:19:36,015 --> 01:19:37,017
Yeah.

1003
01:19:37,037 --> 01:19:38,039
It's only two months.

1004
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:47,715
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.

1005
01:19:47,735 --> 01:19:50,510
I'll do my best while you're gone.

1006
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,860
I'll see you, then.

1007
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,910
Have a good trip!

1008
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:28,230
I and Luisa, my betrothed, were born in a distant land.

1009
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:41,160
In that town, magic still lived, and in the veins of its artisans flowed the blood of sorcerers.

1010
01:20:47,580 --> 01:21:02,430
It was a poor doll maker's apprentice who fashioned us, but Luisa and I were happy because he had made us so we could love others.

1011
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:05,140
But then...

1012
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:13,445
Shizuku!

1013
01:21:13,465 --> 01:21:14,800
Shizuku!

1014
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:17,780
Shizuku!

1015
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:21,915
What's going on?

1016
01:21:21,935 --> 01:21:23,400
Tsukishima!

1017
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:26,045
I'm sorry.

1018
01:21:26,065 --> 01:21:27,280
I wasn't listening.

1019
01:21:27,335 --> 01:21:28,652
Pay attention!

1020
01:21:28,672 --> 01:21:29,989
This is important!

1021
01:21:30,035 --> 01:21:31,120
Sorry, sir.

1022
01:21:31,155 --> 01:21:33,370
Harada, you read.

1023
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,800
You were up until four again?!

1024
01:21:38,845 --> 01:21:40,222
It's OK.

1025
01:21:40,242 --> 01:21:41,619
I'm not sleepy at all.

1026
01:21:41,675 --> 01:21:44,182
But you're spaced out all the time.

1027
01:21:44,202 --> 01:21:46,709
Like just now...

1028
01:21:46,765 --> 01:21:49,062
I was thinking.

1029
01:21:49,082 --> 01:21:51,379
I've got to organize what I want to write.

1030
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:55,310
I'm not hungry.

1031
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:25,065
Shizuku?

1032
01:22:25,085 --> 01:22:26,420
So, you are home.

1033
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,180
Turn on the lights!

1034
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:33,180
At least you could bring in the laundry!

1035
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:35,240
Shizuku!

1036
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:36,680
Come here!

1037
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:42,030
Shizuku's here, isn't she?

1038
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:44,030
She's not hungry.

1039
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:10,420
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

1040
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,090
- Sorry to trouble you.

1041
01:23:12,145 --> 01:23:13,857
This way.

1042
01:23:13,877 --> 01:23:15,589
Is anyone in the guidance office?

1043
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:18,310
Please.

1044
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:25,780
I'm home!

1045
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:30,160
Welcome back.

1046
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:32,790
You're home early, Shiho.

1047
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:36,870
I'm beat!

1048
01:23:36,915 --> 01:23:38,068
- Want some coffee?

1049
01:23:38,088 --> 01:23:39,241
- Yes, please.

1050
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:45,670
Mom, can I talk to you?

1051
01:23:45,705 --> 01:23:46,720
What?

1052
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:54,140
I'm thinking of moving out.

1053
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:57,090
- I've found a place.

1054
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:59,090
- But can you afford it?

1055
01:23:59,135 --> 01:24:01,520
I've saved from my job.

1056
01:24:01,565 --> 01:24:03,218
I found another one at a cram school.

1057
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:04,891
I'll get by.

1058
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:09,700
I guess I've made you help me out too much around here.

1059
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,830
I'll talk to your father.

1060
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,380
You will?

1061
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,440
Great!

1062
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:24,090
Money's tight till I graduate in the spring and get working, but I'll help you out then.

1063
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,960
Sounds good.

1064
01:24:25,995 --> 01:24:28,920
Sorry to go during your master's thesis.

1065
01:24:28,955 --> 01:24:30,640
Thanks.

1066
01:24:30,675 --> 01:24:34,560
You helped enough just with sorting out data.

1067
01:24:34,605 --> 01:24:37,382
And Shizuku can concentrate in her own room.

1068
01:24:37,402 --> 01:24:40,179
She's acting weird.

1069
01:24:40,225 --> 01:24:41,810
You think so too?

1070
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:44,515
The school called me.

1071
01:24:44,535 --> 01:24:46,140
Look at this.

1072
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:48,030
What is it?

1073
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,370
She's gone down a hundred places!

1074
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:55,525
She's at her desk all the time.

1075
01:24:55,545 --> 01:24:57,530
What's she doing?

1076
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:07,120
- Good evening.

1077
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:08,410
- Hello.

1078
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:12,300
Excuse me.

1079
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:21,480
What high school will take you with marks like this?!

1080
01:25:21,515 --> 01:25:24,020
I'm not going to high school!

1081
01:25:24,065 --> 01:25:26,967
Not going to high school?  Use your head!

1082
01:25:26,987 --> 01:25:29,889
What can you do with a middle school education?

1083
01:25:29,935 --> 01:25:32,530
I can decide my own future!

1084
01:25:32,565 --> 01:25:34,120
Don't get too cocky!

1085
01:25:34,165 --> 01:25:36,377
Face the facts!

1086
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:38,609
The school makes its report on you after the second term!

1087
01:25:38,655 --> 01:25:41,040
You're a fine one to talk!

1088
01:25:41,085 --> 01:25:42,527
You don't study!

1089
01:25:42,547 --> 01:25:43,989
You just work part-time!

1090
01:25:44,035 --> 01:25:46,290
I do what I have to!

1091
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:49,035
You're the one who isn't doing that.

1092
01:25:49,055 --> 01:25:51,080
Don't you understand?

1093
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,550
I've got something more important to do!

1094
01:25:55,595 --> 01:25:56,998
Like what?

1095
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:58,421
Tell me.

1096
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:03,060
Shiho, Shizuku, that's enough.

1097
01:26:03,095 --> 01:26:06,360
But Dad, listen to this girl!

1098
01:26:06,395 --> 01:26:09,940
Both of you come out here and tell me about it.

1099
01:26:09,975 --> 01:26:12,400
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.

1100
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:16,570
Come on.

1101
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:32,455
I see.

1102
01:26:32,475 --> 01:26:34,540
Is it true what Shiho says?

1103
01:26:34,585 --> 01:26:36,760
I never said I wouldn't care about my marks!

1104
01:26:36,795 --> 01:26:39,470
You just said you weren't going to high school.

1105
01:26:39,505 --> 01:26:42,140
You said I wouldn't get into one!

1106
01:26:42,175 --> 01:26:46,730
Shiho, can Shizuku and I talk alone for a bit?

1107
01:26:46,765 --> 01:26:48,560
Yes.

1108
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:51,870
- Where's your mother?

1109
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:53,020
- At the Tanakas.

1110
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,355
- I'm back.

1111
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:56,980
- Hi, Mom.

1112
01:26:57,035 --> 01:26:57,998
- Is your dad back?

1113
01:26:58,018 --> 01:26:58,981
- Yes.

1114
01:26:59,035 --> 01:27:01,312
Could you come here, Asako?

1115
01:27:01,332 --> 01:27:03,609
I've been hearing about Shizuku.

1116
01:27:03,655 --> 01:27:04,750
Coming.

1117
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:12,420
All right, Shizuku.

1118
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:18,930
Is what you're doing now more important than studying?

1119
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,100
Can you tell me what it is?

1120
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,600
When it's time.

1121
01:27:26,635 --> 01:27:30,940
Is this something you have to do right away?

1122
01:27:30,975 --> 01:27:34,070
I've only got three weeks left to do it!

1123
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:37,990
I'm testing myself.

1124
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:39,950
I have to.

1125
01:27:39,995 --> 01:27:41,648
Testing yourself?

1126
01:27:41,668 --> 01:27:43,321
How?

1127
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,040
How will we know if you don't say?

1128
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:52,130
Is it something you can't even tell us?

1129
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:54,687
- Dear!

1130
01:27:54,707 --> 01:27:55,674
- Oh, sorry.

1131
01:27:55,694 --> 01:27:56,661
Just one moment.

1132
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:12,860
Whatever you're doing at the library, I admire how hard you're working.

1133
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:17,070
Let's let her do what she wants.

1134
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:20,820
Not everyone has to be the same.

1135
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:27,500
I should know that if anyone does...

1136
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:31,670
OK, Shizuku, do what you believe in.

1137
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,760
But it's not easy when you walk your own road.

1138
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:40,220
You've only got yourself to blame.

1139
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:45,390
And join us at mealtimes, all right?

1140
01:28:45,435 --> 01:28:46,377
- Yeah.

1141
01:28:46,397 --> 01:28:47,339
We're a family.

1142
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:48,301
- Yes.

1143
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:50,390
Call Shiho.

1144
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:55,230
I'll make some tea.

1145
01:28:58,150 --> 01:28:59,240
Shizuku.

1146
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:05,370
I know what Dad said, but what he really wants is for you to study.

1147
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,050
I know.

1148
01:29:07,070 --> 01:29:08,320
It's written on his face.

1149
01:29:08,870 --> 01:29:12,120
I'm moving out next Sunday.

1150
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,750
You'll have your own room.

1151
01:29:14,785 --> 01:29:16,670
You're leaving home?

1152
01:29:16,715 --> 01:29:17,743
Yep.

1153
01:29:17,763 --> 01:29:18,791
So, smarten up!

1154
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:30,770
Hurry!

1155
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,310
Hurry!

1156
01:29:34,810 --> 01:29:37,150
Only one is real.

1157
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:40,030
Which is the real one?!

1158
01:29:40,075 --> 01:29:41,202
Hurry!

1159
01:29:41,222 --> 01:29:42,349
Hurry!

1160
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:44,660
Hurry!

1161
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:28,680
Luisa, you've finally come, but I've grown so old.

1162
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:56,960
Shizuku-san.

1163
01:31:57,005 --> 01:31:59,052
Come in.

1164
01:31:59,072 --> 01:32:01,119
I was fast asleep.

1165
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:04,805
I'm sorry to bother you.

1166
01:32:04,825 --> 01:32:07,160
I've brought my story.

1167
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:13,600
It's finished?

1168
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:19,270
You promised you'd be the first to read it.

1169
01:32:19,305 --> 01:32:21,520
It's a novel!

1170
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:25,600
Note: Whisper of the Heart Can you read it now?

1171
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:29,900
I'll wait as long as it takes.

1172
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:32,855
But you've worked so hard on it.

1173
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:35,400
Shouldn't I take my time?

1174
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,405
You can stop if you don't like it.

1175
01:32:38,425 --> 01:32:41,030
I hate to ask, but...

1176
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,250
My heart's pounding.

1177
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:46,290
I see.

1178
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:47,710
I'll read it right now.

1179
01:32:47,765 --> 01:32:49,477
Come sit by the fire.

1180
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:51,209
It's cold.

1181
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,390
Now we won't be bothered.

1182
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:06,570
Can I wait downstairs?

1183
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,165
It's OK.

1184
01:33:08,185 --> 01:33:09,310
I'm not cold at all.

1185
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:14,830
Of course, but...

1186
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:29,940
You're asleep here?

1187
01:34:29,975 --> 01:34:32,110
Shizuku-san, I'm finished.

1188
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:35,815
Thank you.

1189
01:34:35,835 --> 01:34:37,110
It's very good.

1190
01:34:37,155 --> 01:34:39,160
It's not!

1191
01:34:39,205 --> 01:34:39,397
Say what you really think!

1192
01:34:39,417 --> 01:34:39,609
I couldn't write what I wanted!

1193
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:44,740
The last half doesn't make sense.

1194
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:46,530
I know that!

1195
01:34:46,575 --> 01:34:52,760
Yes, it's rough, blunt, unfinished, just like Seiji's violin.

1196
01:34:55,470 --> 01:35:01,020
You've shown me the rough stone you've just cut out of the rock.

1197
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:03,280
You've worked hard.

1198
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,010
You're wonderful.

1199
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:08,720
There's no need to rush now.

1200
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:10,850
Take your time and polish it.

1201
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:37,480
It's cold out here.

1202
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,130
Come inside.

1203
01:35:39,175 --> 01:35:40,680
Now...

1204
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:44,020
Now that I've written it I know.

1205
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,100
Wanting isn't enough.

1206
01:35:47,135 --> 01:35:55,780
I have to learn more, but Seiji-kun's getting further and further ahead.

1207
01:35:55,815 --> 01:36:00,200
I felt that I had to force myself to write, and I was so scared.

1208
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:05,500
You like Seiji, do you?

1209
01:36:26,230 --> 01:36:27,850
How is it?

1210
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:30,190
It's very good.

1211
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:37,610
When Seiji finished his first violin, we had ramen noodles.

1212
01:36:37,645 --> 01:36:39,410
Jumbo size.

1213
01:36:44,410 --> 01:36:45,910
Thank you.

1214
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:50,920
Now, where was I?

1215
01:36:50,955 --> 01:36:54,130
You found the Baron in a coffee shop when you were a student in Germany...

1216
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,340
Yes, yes.

1217
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:02,350
He looked so melancholic.

1218
01:37:02,385 --> 01:37:05,560
I asked the owner to sell him to me.

1219
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,520
But he wouldn't.

1220
01:37:08,555 --> 01:37:13,610
The Baron had a lover, and he wouldn't separate them.

1221
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:22,280
He was waiting for her to come back from being repaired at the doll maker's shop.

1222
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:26,540
Just like in my story!

1223
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:30,370
Yes, quite the coincidence.

1224
01:37:30,405 --> 01:37:34,500
I had to come home, so I'd just about given up.

1225
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:46,180
Then a lady friend of mine said when the other doll came back, she would take it and bring the two dolls together.

1226
01:37:46,215 --> 01:37:48,560
So the owner gave in.

1227
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:53,190
So I ended up leaving Germany with just the Baron.

1228
01:37:53,225 --> 01:37:59,570
I promised her I'd come back, and asked her to keep the other doll.

1229
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:08,580
The day the dolls met again would be the day we did.

1230
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:14,750
But then the war started, and I couldn't keep my promise.

1231
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:21,590
When I was finally able to go back, I looked all over for her.

1232
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:28,010
But there was no trace of her or the Baron's lover.

1233
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:32,520
She must have been very important to you.

1234
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:39,980
Your story brought the Baron out of my memory and back to life.

1235
01:38:40,015 --> 01:38:41,740
Oh, yes.

1236
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,080
Hold out your hand.

1237
01:38:58,460 --> 01:38:59,550
But...

1238
01:38:59,595 --> 01:39:01,682
That stone suits you perfectly.

1239
01:39:01,702 --> 01:39:03,789
I'll give it to you.

1240
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:08,390
Now, finish up your story.

1241
01:39:08,425 --> 01:39:09,390
Yes.

1242
01:39:25,150 --> 01:39:26,700
Thank you!

1243
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:32,240
Goodbye!

1244
01:39:42,670 --> 01:39:43,760
I'm home.

1245
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:45,590
Welcome back.

1246
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:49,430
Where's Dad?

1247
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,815
In the bath.

1248
01:39:51,835 --> 01:39:53,670
Where have you been till this hour?

1249
01:39:53,725 --> 01:39:56,462
Sorry I worried you.

1250
01:39:56,482 --> 01:39:59,219
Today I return to studying for my entrance exams.

1251
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:02,230
So, your trials are over?

1252
01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:04,110
For now.

1253
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:07,415
Did you eat?

1254
01:40:07,435 --> 01:40:08,600
There's curry.

1255
01:40:08,645 --> 01:40:09,530
I'm fine!

1256
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:13,080
"For now."

1257
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:25,670
Shizuku, the bath's open.

1258
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:47,450
Ah, a soldier at ease.

1259
01:41:54,180 --> 01:41:55,300
No way!

1260
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:04,860
Wait there!

1261
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:21,240
It's a miracle!

1262
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:22,450
You're here!

1263
01:42:22,495 --> 01:42:24,170
We're not dreaming?

1264
01:42:24,215 --> 01:42:25,887
I got an earlier plane.

1265
01:42:25,907 --> 01:42:27,579
Hop on.

1266
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,340
Wait, you'll be cold.

1267
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:34,840
Climb on.

1268
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:37,560
I'll get a coat.

1269
01:42:37,605 --> 01:42:38,647
No time!

1270
01:42:38,667 --> 01:42:39,709
Get on.

1271
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:44,100
Hang on tight.

1272
01:42:49,190 --> 01:42:53,240
I was out there calling you in my head.

1273
01:42:53,275 --> 01:42:54,950
"Shizuku!"

1274
01:42:54,985 --> 01:42:58,780
And then you appeared!

1275
01:42:58,815 --> 01:43:00,120
What a team we are!

1276
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,260
Me too.

1277
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,240
It's like I'm still dreaming!

1278
01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:12,590
How was Cremona?

1279
01:43:12,635 --> 01:43:14,373
A lot different than I thought.

1280
01:43:14,393 --> 01:43:16,131
But I'm going to do it.

1281
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:18,350
It's getting light!

1282
01:43:27,570 --> 01:43:28,720
- Shall I get off?

1283
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:29,890
- It's OK.

1284
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:36,360
I made up my mind I was going to ride you up this hill!

1285
01:43:36,395 --> 01:43:38,070
That's not fair!

1286
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:42,950
I'm no man's burden!

1287
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:49,670
I want to be of use!

1288
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:51,680
OK!

1289
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:52,700
Push!

1290
01:43:53,550 --> 01:43:54,670
Almost there!

1291
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:10,680
Shizuku!

1292
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:12,100
Jump on!

1293
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:31,540
We made it!

1294
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:37,605
- I'll hold the coat.

1295
01:44:37,625 --> 01:44:38,750
- It's OK.

1296
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:43,140
Here...

1297
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:02,105
Wow!

1298
01:45:02,125 --> 01:45:03,980
In the mist it looks just like the sea!

1299
01:45:04,035 --> 01:45:06,042
This is my secret place.

1300
01:45:06,062 --> 01:45:08,069
It's almost time.

1301
01:45:52,830 --> 01:45:55,040
I wanted you to see this.

1302
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:01,510
Grandpa told me everything.

1303
01:46:01,555 --> 01:46:03,767
I didn't do anything to help.

1304
01:46:03,787 --> 01:46:05,999
I was just thinking of myself.

1305
01:46:06,045 --> 01:46:09,180
No, you were the reason I did it.

1306
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:12,615
I'm glad I pushed myself.

1307
01:46:12,635 --> 01:46:15,140
I understand myself better now.

1308
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:20,820
I'm going to study hard and go on to high school.

1309
01:46:20,855 --> 01:46:23,280
Listen, Shizuku.

1310
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:28,040
I can't say how soon it'll be, but...

1311
01:46:28,870 --> 01:46:30,960
...would you marry me?

1312
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:36,590
I'm going to be a violin maker and then...

1313
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:43,090
You mean it?

1314
01:46:43,125 --> 01:46:46,300
That's exactly what I wanted.

1315
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:47,610
Yeah?

1316
01:46:47,630 --> 01:46:48,590
Great!

1317
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:52,020
Wait, it's cold.

1318
01:46:52,890 --> 01:46:55,860
Shizuku, I love you!

1319
01:47:05,820 --> 01:50:47,130
