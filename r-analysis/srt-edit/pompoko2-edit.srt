2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:14,383
Raccoon, Mr.

3
00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:21,513
Raccoon, Come on out and play Some other time I'm having dinner now What are you eating?

4
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:25,693
Pickled plums and radish Can you give me some?

5
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:28,863
Don '2' be such a greedy bum Gel' your own!

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:46,547
POM POKO We used to live near a farmhouse.

7
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,926
But not to steal their food.

8
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:52,887
In the farms and fields...

9
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:57,058
there are always frogs, grasshoppers, mice, moles...

10
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,268
persimmons and mulberries.

11
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:03,022
Much more food than in the mountains.

12
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:08,736
Then suddenly last spring the humans went away.

13
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:13,699
They didn't come back, so we decided to move in.

14
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:28,380
That was such a wonderful year.

15
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:32,301
A house with a garden, it was like a dream!

16
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,803
But then...

17
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,987
We usually don't have strict rules about territory.

18
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,073
But this was different.

19
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:57,493
Wherever we went for food, we came up against others.

20
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,913
There were fights and our territory was invaded.

21
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,123
And finally...

22
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,836
Pom Poke Year 31, autumn.

23
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:10,589
In the clear-cut forest of Taka near Suzu...

24
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,802
the raccoons of the Tama Hills faced their final battle.

25
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,836
Gonta the Brave led the Taka forces.

26
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,716
Seizaemon the Elder led the raccoons from Suzu.

27
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:03,475
It's a little-known fact, but when humans aren't around...

28
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:08,063
raccoons stand and walk on two legs, just like this.

29
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:04,870
The battle was fierce but it didn't last long.

30
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:07,196
Fight, fight!

31
00:04:07,216 --> 00:04:08,614
Taka!

32
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:10,032
Fight, fight!

33
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:11,450
Suzu!

34
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:12,688
Taka win!

35
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,717
Suzu win!

36
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:14,746
Both of you lose.

37
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,466
Let the losers be killed.

38
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:20,563
Taka's forest is gone today.

39
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,461
Suzu's will be gone tomorrow.

40
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,475
Too many raccoons, no place to live.

41
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,478
Too many raccoons, where will they go?

42
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:31,053
There's no place to go.

43
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:32,513
You're all finished.

44
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:33,695
Taka win!

45
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:34,752
Suzu win!

46
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:35,809
Both of you lose.

47
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:38,320
Let the losers be killed.

48
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,532
Let the losers die for the sake of all.

49
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:44,400
It will be a blessing!

50
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,986
The fewer the better.

51
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:49,571
You survivors, take care!

52
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:51,948
Have no more babies.

53
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:56,797
Or there won't be enough forest to hold them.

54
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,679
Urged on by Granny Oroku...

55
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,099
the raccoons looked and were stunned by what they saw.

56
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,101
The hills had vanished...

57
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,687
and the earth had been stripped bare.

58
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,648
The land was empty and cold.

59
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,734
It's insane!

60
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,653
This is no time for fighting!

61
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,702
In the 1960s, Japan's economy was booming.

62
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:32,124
Demand for housing near Tokyo skyrocketed.

63
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:39,548
Construction spread to the hills and farmland surrounding the city.

64
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:44,970
The biggest housing development was called Tama New Town.

65
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:50,684
30,000 acres would be developed for 300,000 people.

66
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:55,064
Mountains were deforested, stripped and leveled.

67
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,233
Farms were bulldozed, old houses were demolished.

68
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,697
The Tama Hills became a residential development.

69
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:08,077
The forested hills became a sprawling suburban community.

70
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,705
It was the largest urban development project ever.

71
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,169
Those humans are truly amazing.

72
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:21,924
I always believed they were animals just like us.

73
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:29,556
But now I think humans must be as powerful as gods.

74
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,021
There was no time to lose.

75
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:40,275
The raccoons gathered from all over the Tama Hills...

76
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:45,072
for a midnight meeting in the abandoned temple of Manpukuji.

77
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:48,565
Tsurukame the priest was 105.

78
00:06:48,585 --> 00:06:51,818
He was the chairman of the meeting.

79
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:55,332
Given this dire situation...

80
00:06:55,666 --> 00:07:00,087
we must give up our nocturnal habits...

81
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:04,716
and be ready for action during the daytime.

82
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:09,471
Their plan was to try to stop the development.

83
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,725
Then it's unanimous!

84
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,813
The meeting broke up at once.

85
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,650
All decisions would be made by the council of elders.

86
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:27,239
They announced a 5-year plan to study the humans...

87
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:31,243
and revive the ancient art of transformation.

88
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:35,622
Messengers would be sent to far-off Shikoku and Sade...

89
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,917
to seek help from famous Transformation Masters.

90
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,171
But the journeys would be perilous.

91
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,259
Nobody volunteered to go.

92
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,179
They all pretended to be asleep.

93
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:55,350
I suppose we'll just have to leave it to the younger raccoons.

94
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,021
Agreed!

95
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,483
Getting down to business...

96
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:07,446
they proceeded to research McDonald's hamburgers.

97
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,699
The meeting ended with everyone well satisfied.

98
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:31,678
NO DUMPING They decided that an old TV would be the best way...

99
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:35,682
to collect in-depth information on humans.

100
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,067
Good evening.

101
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,360
Good evening!

102
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:50,489
The TV aroused great interest.

103
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,497
Raccoons started to hang out at headquarters...

104
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,501
just to watch the TV all day.

105
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:10,342
Transformation requires extreme physical and mental discipline.

106
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:15,138
Truly, shape-shifting is the greatest miracle.

107
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:20,769
Less-skilled animals like chameleons use mimicry.

108
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:26,608
Only raccoons, foxes and a few cats can transform themselves.

109
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,945
Gonta!

110
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:33,365
See how you did that?

111
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,161
You already have the gift of transformation.

112
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:43,959
It's quite easy once you get the hang of it.

113
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,794
At least in theory.

114
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,549
I'll give you a demonstration.

115
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,219
Don't you need a big leaf?

116
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,638
That's only for beginners.

117
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,189
It's been a while.

118
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,404
With Granny Oroku as their teacher...

119
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,616
transformation training proceeded rapidly.

120
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:22,456
All the youngsters were eager to practice their new skill.

121
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,000
Excellent, Shokichi!

122
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,891
I've always been interested in humans.

123
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:45,187
We're not supposed to get too close to them...

124
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,982
but my dear departed father never stopped me.

125
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,528
Detailed knowledge of humans is the key to transformation.

126
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:57,366
Dad knew it would be useful for my future.

127
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,889
Of course, some students lagged behind.

128
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:24,726
In fact, many were just hopeless.

129
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,652
The key to transformation is extreme discipline of mind and body.

130
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:38,198
Foxes work hard at it, but raccoons are easily distracted.

131
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,575
Some of them played hooky.

132
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,162
Hey!

133
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,212
Ponkichi!

134
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,924
Ready, set, let's all transform!

135
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:02,264
My friend Ponkichi never got the hang of transformation.

136
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,935
He just wanted to be an ordinary raccoon.

137
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,399
A human looked up at the evening sky...

138
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,610
and saw the moon rising over the mountains.

139
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:20,240
Then a tree branch blocked the moon.

140
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:25,652
The human said, âThat's strange.

141
00:12:25,672 --> 00:12:30,740
There was no branch before.â The branch disappeared and stuck out on the other side.

142
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,755
The human saw this and said...

143
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,082
âWait!

144
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:41,294
There were branches on both sides.â So a branch stuck out on the other side too.

145
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,848
Then boom, both branches fell.

146
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,142
What really fell?

147
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,435
A raccoon!

148
00:12:48,904 --> 00:12:50,066
Yes!

149
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:51,248
And why did he fall?

150
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:52,430
Gonta?

151
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:54,014
Because he was stupid.

152
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,432
I would never fall.

153
00:12:55,744 --> 00:12:56,766
Good.

154
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:57,808
That's the spirit.

155
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,281
Sasuke, why did he fall?

156
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,284
He lost hold of the tree.

157
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:06,192
Very good.

158
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:07,735
And what does this teach us?

159
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:09,278
Shokichi?

160
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,794
That you shouldn't believe everything humans say.

161
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,295
Right.

162
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:18,121
We raccoons are too trusting.

163
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:20,665
It's easy for humans to fool us.

164
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:22,792
Then we get into trouble.

165
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:24,502
Does everyone understand?

166
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,056
Yes, Tsurukame.

167
00:13:26,608 --> 00:13:29,945
Now, what if I start singing?

168
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:33,302
Raccoon, raccoon Come on out and play.

169
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,442
We're in the middle of a lesson!

170
00:13:37,702 --> 00:13:39,267
See?

171
00:13:39,287 --> 00:13:40,852
You fell for it.

172
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:42,437
That's what I was afraid of.

173
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:03,510
The raccoons were still hard at work when spring arrived.

174
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:05,857
Flowers were blooming.

175
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:08,089
It was the season for love.

176
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:12,602
Following Granny Oroku's warning...

177
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,856
many of the raccoons abstained from mating...

178
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,025
to keep the population under control.

179
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,361
Especially the females.

180
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,781
They controlled their maternal instincts with firm willpower...

181
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:28,159
rejecting the lovesick advances of the males.

182
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,502
Meanwhile, work continued on the massive development.

183
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:41,423
More forest disappeared, more land was cleared for housing.

184
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,259
The raccoons were sad and angry.

185
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,387
They called the site âthe bald hillsâ.

186
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,609
Mr.

187
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:52,339
Mailman, you dropped something.

188
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:56,938
The females, who were just as independent as the males...

189
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,442
were also just as skilled at transformation.

190
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:07,073
When males transformed into girls, it sometimes looked unnatural...

191
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,492
so the females coached them.

192
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:15,415
Some females also transformed into men.

193
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:23,632
Class is over, but I want the boys to stay here.

194
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:29,930
One day Tsurukame gave the males a special lecture.

195
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:37,145
Boys, there's something special about the mat you're sitting on.

196
00:15:37,614 --> 00:15:39,450
I won't beat around the bush.

197
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,306
It's my testicles!

198
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,017
150 square feet.

199
00:15:44,037 --> 00:15:46,144
Here's your proof.

200
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,629
After basic training, the students went into the field.

201
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,633
It's like learning to drive.

202
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:10,470
You need someone experienced to come with you...

203
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:14,641
and back you up if you get in a tight spot.

204
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,676
The art of transformation requires a great deal of energy...

205
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,554
especially when transforming into humans.

206
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:58,810
The dark circles around raccoons' eyes...

207
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,187
are from sheer fatigue.

208
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,648
Even experienced transformers...

209
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:09,029
...need an emergency energy boost every now and then.

210
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:14,743
Too much fatigue might mean changing back into a raccoon.

211
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:23,543
Recently, fast-acting energy drinks have become very popular.

212
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,839
To graduate from field training...

213
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:33,553
each student had to work as a human and earn 1,000 yen.

214
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,680
I'm beat!

215
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,893
Some raccoons pretended to be one worker.

216
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:44,064
Others posed as monks begging for alms.

217
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:49,277
A few females worked in bars to earn money for energy drinks.

218
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,239
One even tried his luck at pachinko.

219
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,077
One broke into a temple donation box.

220
00:17:57,212 --> 00:18:00,049
But all he got was a few coins.

221
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:02,906
Granny Oroku saw right through him.

222
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:09,547
I told you, never turn leaves into money!

223
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:21,768
An urgent report interrupted Gonta's training at headquarters.

224
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:26,606
He rushed to the Taka Forest and was shocked by what he saw.

225
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:30,026
Developers had turned his homeland into bald hills.

226
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,990
Furious, he rushed back to headquarters.

227
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,285
He called a meeting of the council...

228
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,455
and demanded total war against the humans.

229
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,291
I'm against it.

230
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,417
Why?

231
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:48,555
It's too soon.

232
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:50,411
You need more experience.

233
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:52,727
We finished our training.

234
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:54,667
We can do great things.

235
00:18:55,228 --> 00:18:58,024
What do you think, Granny?

236
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:00,840
Are they up to it?

237
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,686
They certainly have the basic skills.

238
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,104
But...?

239
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:08,972
They lack experience.

240
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:11,683
The humans might see through them.

241
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,123
We need to know, Gonta.

242
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:16,396
Why are you proposing this?

243
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:20,827
Is it because of what happened to your home forest?

244
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:21,953
Is that it?

245
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:26,531
No, I swear.

246
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:29,951
It's for the happiness of all the raccoons in Tama.

247
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,839
What a lot of nonsense.

248
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:37,969
It was you who tried to take over Suzu forest.

249
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:39,398
Shut up!

250
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:40,712
Even if you won't join me...

251
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,849
the Taka raccoons will fight.

252
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,060
If Gonta's going, then I'm going too.

253
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,062
You Will, Shokichi?

254
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,981
Thanks!

255
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:54,527
All right men, there's no turning back now!

256
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,071
Wait!

257
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,200
You can't stop us, Granny.

258
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:05,038
I'd better teach you a special skill for emergencies.

259
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:14,214
If the humans see through you, this disguise will last for five days.

260
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,008
Well, what is it?

261
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,261
A dead fox.

262
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,555
Pom Poke '(ear 32, summer.

263
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,308
Gonta and a band of brave followers...

264
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:29,270
set out to test their new transformation skills...

265
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,857
in a surprise attack on the humans.

266
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,860
Their counterattack had finally started.

267
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,208
Here they come!

268
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:57,142
This way!

269
00:20:57,162 --> 00:20:59,039
This way!

270
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,266
We did it!

271
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:56,316
This afternoon, at the Tama New Town site...

272
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,193
five more workers were killed or injured...

273
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,488
in a landslide and accident involving a trailer.

274
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:07,035
One building under construction was completely destroyed.

275
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:12,540
Heavy rains and poor visibility were blamed for the accident.

276
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:16,878
Because so many accidents have occurred simultaneously...

277
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:21,341
questions are being asked about the project's overall management.

278
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,551
Local residents are concerned...

279
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:28,014
and some are demanding that the development be cancelled.

280
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,061
Hold on there!

281
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:37,732
The humans who died were victims of this war.

282
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:42,862
First we should pay our respects to the memories of those who died.

283
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,239
Tsurukame is right.

284
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:51,245
Let's have a minute of silence for the victims.

285
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,372
Hurray!

286
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,374
Minute of silence!

287
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,376
Let us remember.

288
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:14,707
- We won!

289
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,781
We won!

290
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:16,855
- Let's celebrate!

291
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:17,929
A big party!

292
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,430
Gonta's back!

293
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,350
The heroes have returned.

294
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,314
You did great, Shokichi.

295
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:07,947
You young people give us hope for the future.

296
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,617
And we're just getting started.

297
00:24:12,503 --> 00:24:14,735
Listen up!

298
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:16,987
Everyone must join the fight.

299
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,824
We'll kill them!

300
00:24:19,844 --> 00:24:21,492
Destroy them!

301
00:24:21,512 --> 00:24:23,160
Run them out of these hills forever!

302
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,798
Say something, Shokichi.

303
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:31,637
Then we'll plant lots of our favorite persimmon trees.

304
00:24:32,482 --> 00:24:36,758
Hurry, persimmon seed, sprout' a free If you don't, I'll chop you up Out with the humans!

305
00:24:36,778 --> 00:24:41,054
Kill them!

306
00:24:41,074 --> 00:24:45,350
Destroy them!

307
00:24:45,495 --> 00:24:48,207
All right, that's enough war talk.

308
00:24:48,227 --> 00:24:50,939
Let's just celebrate, shall we?

309
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,951
I'm a little worried about something.

310
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:55,328
What?

311
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,332
Do we have to drive out every human?

312
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:00,333
Of course!

313
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:02,366
Can't we let a few stay?

314
00:25:02,386 --> 00:25:03,951
Like before?

315
00:25:04,347 --> 00:25:05,662
No!

316
00:25:05,682 --> 00:25:06,997
They're our sworn enemies!

317
00:25:07,017 --> 00:25:08,332
They're monsters!

318
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,468
We have to exterminate them!

319
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:13,398
Are you sure?

320
00:25:13,418 --> 00:25:15,671
Of course, I hate them too.

321
00:25:16,275 --> 00:25:18,403
Some of them are all right.

322
00:25:18,423 --> 00:25:20,551
No, I hate them all!

323
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,688
But...

324
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,190
But what?

325
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:30,112
If they all go away, we'll never eat tempura again.

326
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:32,657
Or sardines...

327
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:34,784
Or corn...

328
00:25:35,044 --> 00:25:36,025
Hamburgers!

329
00:25:36,045 --> 00:25:37,026
Donuts!

330
00:25:37,046 --> 00:25:38,027
Fried chicken!

331
00:25:38,297 --> 00:25:39,737
Potato chips!

332
00:25:39,757 --> 00:25:41,197
Turkey!

333
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,543
I can almost taste them!

334
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:49,048
Well Gonta, what if we let a few humans stay?

335
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,551
It can't be helped.

336
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,639
Let's hear it for Gonta and his men!

337
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:05,523
In the garden of Manpukuji Temple The moon shines bright.

338
00:26:05,658 --> 00:26:07,640
Everyone come out.

339
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,642
Come out.

340
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:11,644
Hurry, hurry, all our friends.

341
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:13,813
Tsurukame, come out!

342
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,231
Everybody look at Granny!

343
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:18,213
You gotta get a look!

344
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:21,070
Everyone's gotta get a look!

345
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:27,169
The government has declared that the needs of a growing population...

346
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:34,927
are too urgent to even consider cancelling the New Town project.

347
00:26:35,563 --> 00:26:36,585
- Hey!

348
00:26:36,605 --> 00:26:37,627
- What did he say?

349
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,518
It was an unfortunate accident.

350
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:49,317
Brave Gonta suffered compound fractures and ruptured organs.

351
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:52,612
He would be sidelined for at least a year.

352
00:26:55,948 --> 00:27:00,244
The news report cast a pall of gloom over the celebrations.

353
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,998
But the humans' fear of divine retribution...

354
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:07,501
gave the raccoons a new idea.

355
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:12,798
Maybe it was a mistake to tear down those shrines.

356
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:13,758
What do you mean?

357
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:19,263
Maybe the guardian spirits are punishing us with these accidents.

358
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:23,309
I hear you had to relocate many of the shrine statues.

359
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:26,854
Of course we made offerings to the spirits...

360
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:30,650
...and held purification rites first.

361
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:33,152
What do you think, Professor?

362
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:39,533
Each locality has its own guardian gods and spirits.

363
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,995
Altering the landscape without their permission...

364
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,499
will naturally invite their anger.

365
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:53,214
I think there is a lo! more bad luck f0 come.

366
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,802
I have an idea.

367
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:04,850
The raccoons promptly put Shokichi's idea to the test.

368
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:17,196
When one of the land owners checked his property before selling...

369
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:22,243
he found more guardian statues than he was expecting.

370
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:26,789
He decided it might be better to delay the contract.

371
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:33,713
The purification rite at a shrine that was about to be relocated...

372
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:38,426
was interrupted by a raccoon posing as the shrine guardian.

373
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,886
He appeared on the roof.

374
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:47,601
Terrified by the fox's wailing, the humans panicked...

375
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,604
and the relocation was cancelled.

376
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:56,527
Instead, the residents requested that the new road be diverted.

377
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,947
Now the raccoons were fired up.

378
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:13,961
They competed with each other to use their transformation skills...

379
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,422
in this new guerrilla war.

380
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,300
Come this way.

381
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,472
Leave our forest alone.

382
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:29,351
Take it with you.

383
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,732
Let's pack the leftovers.

384
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,484
Wait!

385
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,986
Leave the food.

386
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,619
ls something wrong, miss?

387
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,709
What's the matter?

388
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:06,222
I have no face.

389
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,184
A goblin!

390
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,177
L...I just saw...

391
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,136
A murder?

392
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,138
No.

393
00:30:48,607 --> 00:30:49,880
Not a murder?

394
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,173
Oh, well.

395
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,395
It was a woman.

396
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,729
A vampire?

397
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,899
No, she was...

398
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:03,362
Did she look something like this?

399
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,672
Did she...

400
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:26,719
look something like this?

401
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:39,023
It was such fun scaring the humans...

402
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,943
that they decided to have another party.

403
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:50,951
But the hero of the first battles was disappointed that his injuries...

404
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:53,579
were not healing quickly.

405
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:59,919
His wife nursed him well, but he was not ready to fight.

406
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:03,339
He thought the others were losing their aggressive spirit.

407
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:08,855
Last night's news was great! âGoblins appear in New Town.â That cop was on the show.

408
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:14,131
Everyone laughed at him.

409
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,842
He lost his temper.

410
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:17,344
I laughed myself sick.

411
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:20,179
Idiots!

412
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:22,849
Do you think this will stop the project?

413
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:27,363
If you're going to transform, do what I did.

414
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:30,157
Kill the humans!

415
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:38,290
Just as Gonta predicted, the construction didn't stop.

416
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:42,169
Rivers were lined with concrete.

417
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:45,839
Roads were cut through the bald hills.

418
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,009
Housing construction was already under way.

419
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:54,306
However, the mysterious incidents received so much media coverage...

420
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:59,478
that the New Town goblins were famous all over the country.

421
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:02,773
The raccoons' spirits rose higher and higher.

422
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,867
Pom Poke Year 32, autumn.

423
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,162
The raccoons competed for the honor...

424
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,999
of going in search of the Transformation Masters.

425
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:24,712
Tamasaburo was chosen to journey to Shikoku.

426
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,549
Bunta would go to Sado.

427
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,221
At the next full moon...

428
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:39,393
the two young raccoons set off on their long journeys...

429
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,938
after a tearful farewell.

430
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:01,749
The others settled down to wait for the Masters...

431
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,419
while they continued to haunt New Town.

432
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,179
Even if it didn't stop the development...

433
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:19,266
it was their favorite sport.

434
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,200
Daddy!

435
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:05,479
Can we really chase the humans away with these cheap tricks?

436
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:11,151
What if we slip up and they see through us?

437
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:16,115
Should we fight like Gonta says?

438
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:21,328
No, killing one or two humans won't make any difference.

439
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,593
To go on or not to go on.

440
00:35:25,613 --> 00:35:28,116
That is the question.

441
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:39,555
KW o'?

442
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,561
What are you doing?

443
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,316
Does your neck hurt?

444
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,143
I was posing.

445
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:57,186
I thought you might say I was pretty.

446
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,699
Oh, sorry.

447
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:01,702
Now my neck really does hurt.

448
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,078
You looked pretty.

449
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:04,913
Too late.

450
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,999
But I mean it.

451
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,556
It's okay.

452
00:36:11,576 --> 00:36:13,162
I'm out of practice anyway.

453
00:36:26,028 --> 00:36:27,760
Everyone likes that song.

454
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,512
I guess I do too.

455
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:34,526
How about âWhere Are You From?â Nobody sings that now.

456
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:35,736
That song...

457
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:41,867
A raccoon was on Senba Mountain Along came a hunter..

458
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,661
A hunter killed my grandpa.

459
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,165
Sorry, I didn't know.

460
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:49,750
It's okay.

461
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:53,962
But they didn't eat him, like in the song.

462
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:57,716
They sold his pelt for a lot of money.

463
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,177
Your pelt's pretty too.

464
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:03,555
I was hoping you'd say that.

465
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,019
What about that song?

466
00:37:09,988 --> 00:37:12,700
My dad used to sing it.

467
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,432
He was a good ball bouncer too.

468
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,612
He must have been a character.

469
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:24,534
And when he finished singing, he would always start preaching.

470
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:26,245
What did he say?

471
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:35,910
âListen well, children.â âLike the song says...â âthey kill us, cook us and eat us.â âHumans are cruel by nature.

472
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:45,419
That's what the song says.â Hey, let's play ball.

473
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:46,932
Are you good?

474
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,809
Sure am.

475
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:55,649
Now it's my turn.

476
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,008
Where are you from?

477
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:04,496
From Higo...

478
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:05,984
Where's Higo?

479
00:38:06,128 --> 00:38:07,735
From Kumamoto...

480
00:38:07,755 --> 00:38:09,362
Where's Kumamoto?

481
00:38:09,506 --> 00:38:11,988
From Senba...

482
00:38:12,008 --> 00:38:14,490
Where the mountains are full of raccoons.

483
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:19,798
When are you going out on that raid you talked about?

484
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:22,634
I'm getting tired of that stuff.

485
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:25,220
But I liked your idea.

486
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,305
Really?

487
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,932
Why don't we do it tonight?

488
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,684
Together?

489
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,061
Are you afraid?

490
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,565
No, it's not that, but...

491
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,828
Then let's do it.

492
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,726
It'll go just fine.

493
00:38:41,371 --> 00:38:43,353
Okay, you're on.

494
00:38:43,373 --> 00:38:45,355
With you, I'm sure it'll go great.

495
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:47,367
I'm so happy!

496
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:01,048
My, what adorable little children.

497
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,636
We just got back from the stars, but now our house is gone.

498
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:08,638
The stars?

499
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:14,019
From the red-eyed Scorpion, we crossed over the Eagle's wings.

500
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:18,774
We looped the coiled Snake, to the top of the Bear Cub's brow.

501
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:24,237
We scatter dew and frost as we travel through the stars.

502
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,782
Who are you two, anyway?

503
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,704
We're lost and we're cold!

504
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,665
Mister, do you know the way home?

505
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:40,420
We don't know what you're talking about.

506
00:39:41,098 --> 00:39:42,413
We don't know.

507
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:43,748
Now go away!

508
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,426
Better call the cops.

509
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:08,396
They're not kids.

510
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:10,439
They're gremlins!

511
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,547
Forgive us!

512
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:14,404
Forgive us, little gremlins.

513
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,196
Wait a minute.

514
00:40:37,216 --> 00:40:38,802
We can work this out.

515
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,273
Come on, I'll raise your pay.

516
00:40:41,408 --> 00:40:43,160
I'm going home.

517
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,932
I can't take it any more.

518
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,904
This place gives me the creeps.

519
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,824
Come on, don't say that.

520
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,785
I heard Tokyo was a scary place...

521
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,954
but this is too much.

522
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,999
You better forget this whole project.

523
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:02,669
Something doesn't want it to happen.

524
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:12,471
The raccoons cheered.

525
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:16,141
That night's party was especially grand.

526
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:21,354
The heroes of the evening were Kiyo and Shokichi.

527
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:31,364
The construction site was quiet and deserted.

528
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,201
But next morning...

529
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,997
More humans showed up to continue the work.

530
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,500
Despite the raccoons' hard work...

531
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:45,170
there seemed to be an unlimited supply of humans.

532
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:51,384
Some say these strange events are the work of foxes or raccoons.

533
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:59,226
If that were true, all we'd need to do is kill a few animals.

534
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,270
This made the raccoons at headquarters very nervous.

535
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:07,734
But it's just like the old folktales.

536
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,195
No wonder rumors are spreading.

537
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:14,741
Whoever is spreading them must want the project to fail.

538
00:42:14,876 --> 00:42:16,503
Rumors?

539
00:42:16,523 --> 00:42:18,150
We saw it with our own eyes!

540
00:42:18,296 --> 00:42:21,779
Very well.

541
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:25,282
We'll just have to get rid of these dangerous animals.

542
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:30,173
Just let us know when you catch them.

543
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:33,426
That is, if you can prove they did it.

544
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:40,892
It was starting to look as if transformation wouldn't be enough.

545
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:45,605
Long ago, there was a golden age of raccoons.

546
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,441
The art of metamorphosis was at its peak.

547
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:53,905
Raccoons were a favorite subject for artists and writers.

548
00:42:54,332 --> 00:42:57,044
But we abused our powers.

549
00:42:57,064 --> 00:42:59,776
The humans turned against us.

550
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:05,792
As Japan modernized, we were trapped by the thousands.

551
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,254
Our pelts became brushes and fur collars.

552
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:12,966
This was their revenge, but we brought it on ourselves.

553
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:18,305
You must learn from this terrible experience.

554
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,475
Remember that we have been able to live in peace...

555
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:27,939
only because we stopped using our powers recklessly.

556
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,318
Transformation is a great gift.

557
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,945
But if used carelessly...

558
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,616
it will only rekindle the humans' desire for revenge.

559
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:40,285
I urge you all to be careful.

560
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:48,460
The young transforming raccoons were not sure what to do next.

561
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:52,631
But now it was autumn, the best season for raccoons.

562
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:57,135
It was time to store up fat for the winter...

563
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,472
and grow their thick winter coats.

564
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:22,702
They forgot about transforming and stuck to the job of getting food.

565
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:31,169
One day, an exhausted raccoon arrived at the construction site.

566
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,897
It's okay, we're raccoons.

567
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,736
Thank you.

568
00:44:58,206 --> 00:45:00,647
You look exhausted.

569
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:03,108
Where did you come from?

570
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:04,911
From Fujino Mountain.

571
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:06,830
Is that in Shikoku or Sado?

572
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:10,834
It's in Kanagawa, just beyond those mountains.

573
00:45:11,052 --> 00:45:13,368
Kanagawa?

574
00:45:13,388 --> 00:45:15,704
You mean you're not from Shikoku?

575
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:21,052
I'm sorry, I seem to have disappointed you somehow.

576
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:24,305
It's just that we've been waiting for some visitors.

577
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:28,727
Anyway, what is it that brought you here?

578
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:32,939
I was looking for the source of the landfill...

579
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,983
they're dumping on our mountain.

580
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:38,778
According to this raccoon named Hayashi...

581
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:42,741
dirt and construction waste was being dumped...

582
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:44,617
in Fujino's forest.

583
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:48,079
The dumping was hurting the environment...

584
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:53,460
and making survival hard for raccoons and other animals.

585
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:57,589
To find the source of this trouble...

586
00:45:57,714 --> 00:46:03,094
Hayashi hitched a ride on one of the dump trucks.

587
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:16,316
But his transforming skills were rusty, and he fell asleep.

588
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:21,613
Before he arrived in Tama, he changed back into a raccoon.

589
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:25,158
It's not just Fujino, it's other places too.

590
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:28,953
They keep building dump sites and golf courses.

591
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:33,124
They destroy our hills and cause us trouble.

592
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:38,296
Then they dump the waste in Fujino, and cause you trouble.

593
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,882
How far will this insanity go?

594
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:45,970
When I arrived here I couldn't believe it.

595
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:50,892
I thought for sure the waste was coming from the big city.

596
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,311
But this isn't the city!

597
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,730
They level one mountain and dump it on another.

598
00:46:55,865 --> 00:46:57,993
What in the world for?

599
00:46:58,013 --> 00:47:00,141
I don't understand it one bit.

600
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,280
Then if we stop the development...

601
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,909
the Fujino raccoons will be better off too.

602
00:47:09,003 --> 00:47:11,882
I'm so grateful to hear you say that!

603
00:47:11,902 --> 00:47:14,781
Please use all your power...

604
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:20,505
to help save our homeland as well as your own.

605
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:26,010
We'd like to, but unfortunately it's easier said than done.

606
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:34,185
What happened to Bunta and Tamasaburo, anyway?

607
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:37,814
When in the world are they coming back?

608
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,738
There was still no sign of the Transformation Masters.

609
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:48,032
Now it was winter.

610
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,578
During the raccoons' winter rest...

611
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:54,873
the humans forgot the âNew Town Goblinsâ...

612
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,417
and people's attention shifted elsewhere.

613
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:01,838
The media was busy with the private lives of movie stars...

614
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:04,048
and political corruption scandals.

615
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:12,432
In the garden of Manpukuji Temple.

616
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:16,269
Raining, raining cotton candy, ice cream, snow cones!

617
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:20,732
All our friends, Pom Poko, Pom!

618
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:24,110
Pom Poke '(ear 33.

619
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:28,740
New Year's morning brought a fresh blanket of snow.

620
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:36,581
Most of the construction workers had gone home for the holidays...

621
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:39,792
and were enjoying long-awaited family reunions.

622
00:48:53,681 --> 00:49:01,606
Our golden bells s Wing and s wing, though there '.s not a breath of Wind.

623
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:09,614
Baby raccoon sees our swinging balls and swings his too.

624
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,491
We really saw them.

625
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:14,327
A bunch of raccoons did it.

626
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:15,620
It's the truth!

627
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,499
Three workers at the Tama New Town construction site...

628
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:21,960
were arrested for destroying a bulldozer.

629
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:24,671
They maintain that raccoons did it.

630
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:29,300
Investigations are under way, but the snow has already melted.

631
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,636
Look what you've done now, Shokichi.

632
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,180
It's no big deal.

633
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,182
The whole thing's pointless.

634
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:42,480
He was just trying to help the others participate.

635
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,524
What do you think, Tsurukame?

636
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:48,319
I think it Will be okay.

637
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,989
Tsurukame was right.

638
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,659
The workers were released for lack of evidence.

639
00:49:54,794 --> 00:49:57,381
The raccoons weren't blamed.

640
00:49:57,401 --> 00:49:59,988
The case remained a mystery.

641
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,884
Spring came at last.

642
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,973
Once again, the season for love.

643
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:20,685
The raccoons had been chaste for over a year.

644
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,645
Now they couldn't resist.

645
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:28,067
Courtship rivalries and sweet nothings filled the air.

646
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:31,070
Even the sky was rose-colored.

647
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:37,368
Wait up, Hanako!

648
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,884
Hanako, wait!

649
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:55,720
You can't catch me!

650
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:00,767
Everyone has spring fever.

651
00:51:01,027 --> 00:51:03,948
We're just like trees and flowers.

652
00:51:03,968 --> 00:51:06,889
When spring comes, the sun shines.

653
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:08,900
Our flowers blossom...

654
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:12,779
and we bear fruit.

655
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:18,743
But we must obey Granny's orders.

656
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:22,955
Until our battle is won, we will be chaste.

657
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:28,252
Shokichi, you really are a wonderful raccoon.

658
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:30,963
I'm so glad.

659
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:35,551
Our love is forever.

660
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:38,805
Shokichi!

661
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:48,513
That was their big mistake.

662
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:50,307
Their love grew passionate.

663
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:55,154
And sure enough, they ended up like the others.

664
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:59,117
That spring, Shokichi and Kiyo had four baby raccoons.

665
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:04,223
The previous autumn, Tamasaburo had finally reached Shikoku.

666
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:08,019
He went to Kincho Shrine, home of the Masters...

667
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:11,731
to explain the problem and appeal for their help.

668
00:53:11,898 --> 00:53:14,692
But then he fell ill.

669
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:18,529
Koharu, the Master's daughter, cared for him...

670
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:20,406
and he recovered miraculously.

671
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:26,412
That spring the two fell in love and had three babies.

672
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:36,923
In the shrine, the Masters of Shikoku debated endlessly.

673
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:42,762
They agreed that it was important for all of Japan...

674
00:53:42,939 --> 00:53:45,901
to stop the New Town project.

675
00:53:45,921 --> 00:53:48,883
They had to act quickly.

676
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:53,856
But who would go, and who would stay to guard the shrine?

677
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:59,278
Hundreds of questions were raised and discussed from every angle...

678
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:03,282
but no conclusions were reached.

679
00:54:04,085 --> 00:54:05,608
Another summit meeting.

680
00:54:05,628 --> 00:54:07,151
They never seem to end.

681
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,122
And on such a lovely day.

682
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:14,126
The year is half gone already.

683
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:17,630
When will they reach a decision?

684
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:22,260
I never want them to decide!

685
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:31,477
When I think of you leaving us to go back to Tama...

686
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:36,816
I feel so lonely that I'm sure my heart will break.

687
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:47,201
Koharu, I don't want this happiness to end either.

688
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:49,662
Then why don't you stay?

689
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:55,835
I'm going to ask Father.

690
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,589
I want you to stay here and become his successor.

691
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:19,108
While Tamasaburo was absorbed in the trials of youth...

692
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:23,487
Bunta, who had journeyed to Sado, roamed the fields and mountains...

693
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:27,825
searching for a Master called Danzaburo.

694
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:30,536
He searched high and low...

695
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:34,999
but no one he met had heard of the master.

696
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:46,510
From summer to autumn, the raccoons faced a serious dilemma.

697
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:50,222
Not only was their forest disappearing...

698
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:54,727
but the population multiplied with a spring baby boom.

699
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:59,857
Bad weather caused an extreme shortage of food.

700
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:04,403
Persimmons, nuts and other autumn fruits were scarce.

701
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:09,116
Transforming raccoons managed to get food from the humans...

702
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:13,204
but it wasn't enough to feed all the babies.

703
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:30,554
Even the non-transforming raccoons were forced...

704
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,432
to scavenge food from the humans.

705
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:38,729
Some of the careless ones were hit by cars or caught in traps.

706
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:42,733
Many lives were lost.

707
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,396
I've had enough!

708
00:57:20,781 --> 00:57:23,347
It's time to confront the humans.

709
00:57:23,367 --> 00:57:25,933
Right, Shokichi?

710
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:28,988
Are you sure you're all right, Gonta?

711
00:57:29,123 --> 00:57:30,730
Of course!

712
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,357
Watch this!

713
00:57:40,926 --> 00:57:43,200
This calls for a celebration!

714
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,494
When's the party?

715
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:49,967
Granny, this is no time for a party.

716
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:56,182
I think we should wait until the Masters get here.

717
00:57:56,317 --> 00:57:58,257
You too, Shokichi?

718
00:57:58,277 --> 00:58:00,217
I'm sick of you wimps.

719
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:02,980
We mustn't underestimate the humans.

720
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:06,192
If we attack now, we're sure to lose.

721
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:09,028
We've already waited too long!

722
00:58:09,163 --> 00:58:10,832
Hold on.

723
00:58:10,852 --> 00:58:12,521
Let's hear Shokichi's opinion.

724
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:16,994
Until the Masters arrive, I have three proposals.

725
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:21,665
First, equal distribution of food to raccoons who can't transform.

726
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:24,168
We should make it a system.

727
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:28,839
Second, a traffic safety training program.

728
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:36,013
Third, a rescue squad for anyone who gets caught in a trap.

729
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:41,936
Shokichi, you sound just like a human.

730
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:45,189
No, I'm a full-blooded raccoon.

731
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:49,662
Okay, we'll worry about details later.

732
00:58:49,682 --> 00:58:52,685
For now, let's see who agrees.

733
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:54,365
Hands up!

734
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,158
Agreed!

735
00:58:58,327 --> 00:58:59,870
What is this, Gonta?

736
00:59:00,005 --> 00:59:01,070
Shut up!

737
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,155
It's a coup.

738
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:07,795
Anyone who stands in our way will be killed by my guards.

739
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:12,550
Those are dangerous words, Gonta.

740
00:59:12,851 --> 00:59:16,439
That's âGonta, Sir!â Hear me out!

741
00:59:16,459 --> 00:59:20,047
The humans are strong indeed.

742
00:59:20,192 --> 00:59:21,778
But not invincible.

743
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:23,384
We can kill them!

744
00:59:23,779 --> 00:59:27,075
As the saying goes, âA cornered mouse will bite the cat.â A mouse?

745
00:59:27,095 --> 00:59:30,391
How?

746
00:59:30,526 --> 00:59:31,735
It's silly.

747
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,738
We'll stake everything on victory.

748
00:59:34,957 --> 00:59:37,335
Right.

749
00:59:37,355 --> 00:59:39,733
If it fears nothing, even a mouse can win.

750
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:42,246
We're not mice.

751
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:44,498
Biting a cat won't help us.

752
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:49,837
You know, a mouse would taste good right about now.

753
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:51,880
Mouse tempura is the best.

754
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:55,134
No, fried mouse nuggets are tops.

755
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,887
I like 'em breaded and deep fried.

756
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:02,224
Those crispy fried tails!

757
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:07,605
What are you talking about?

758
01:00:07,906 --> 01:00:10,723
All I can say is...

759
01:00:10,743 --> 01:00:13,560
Mouse tempura is my favorite.

760
01:00:13,912 --> 01:00:15,602
Listen, Gonta.

761
01:00:15,622 --> 01:00:17,312
As you see, we're not ready.

762
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:22,202
We'd better just wait for the Masters from Shikoku.

763
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:25,664
I'm sorry.

764
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,959
Just be careful not to have any more babies.

765
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:33,339
But I guess that's too much to expect from us raccoons.

766
01:00:33,641 --> 01:00:36,394
No!

767
01:00:36,414 --> 01:00:39,167
Instead of fewer raccoons, we need fewer humans!

768
01:00:39,595 --> 01:00:43,891
All the places they've infested used to be our homes.

769
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:46,185
They're intruders!

770
01:00:46,654 --> 01:00:48,156
Drive them out.

771
01:00:48,176 --> 01:00:49,678
Kill them!

772
01:00:50,157 --> 01:00:52,223
Drive them out!

773
01:00:52,243 --> 01:00:54,309
Kill them!

774
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,362
Meanwhile...

775
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,462
Hey, Taxi!

776
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,371
I'll tell them we're here.

777
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:00,426
Tamasaburo!

778
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:02,928
I've brought the Masters from Shikoku.

779
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:08,434
Well done, Tamasaburo!

780
01:02:17,911 --> 01:02:20,811
Friends!

781
01:02:20,831 --> 01:02:23,731
On the way here, we saw your devastated mountains.

782
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,576
You have our deepest sympathy.

783
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:31,165
We would like to hold a general meeting tonight.

784
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:34,084
Pom Poke Year 33, autumn.

785
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:38,464
That evening, the raccoons assembled to listen to the Masters.

786
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:44,803
There's a good moon out tonight.

787
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:50,309
My name is Hage of Yashima.

788
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:55,564
Soon I will celebrate my 999th birthday.

789
01:02:56,732 --> 01:03:03,655
Why is Tama being developed but Shikoku is not?

790
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:09,328
It is because we have protected our homeland vigilantly.

791
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:15,584
In Shikoku, the humans know well that if they anger us raccoons...

792
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:18,962
great misfortune will befall them.

793
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:25,010
The humans worship me and my distinguished companions...

794
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:28,847
at every temple and shrine in Shikoku.

795
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,600
They bow down before us.

796
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,520
Allow me to introduce myself.

797
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:39,483
I am the Supreme Leader of Shikoku.

798
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:42,569
My name is lnugami Gyobu.

799
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:50,077
I am Kincho VI, lord of Kincho Shrine.

800
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:54,581
We shall drive out the humans...

801
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:58,210
by uniting our powers for a goblin attack.

802
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:01,213
This battle will require us...

803
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:05,342
to merge our spirits into one powerful force.

804
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:10,097
We three may not even survive this battle.

805
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:18,397
However, if you complete this operation flawlessly...

806
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:25,237
you will regain the respect the humans once had for you.

807
01:04:27,082 --> 01:04:29,648
We must be fearless.

808
01:04:29,668 --> 01:04:32,234
If we focus our combined strength...

809
01:04:32,379 --> 01:04:34,945
we can stop this insane development.

810
01:04:34,965 --> 01:04:37,531
Stop it in its tracks!

811
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:41,670
We have a full arsenal of tricks.

812
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:43,725
We have built a great boat.

813
01:04:43,745 --> 01:04:45,540
An unsinkable boat!

814
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:48,927
A boat that will carry us far.

815
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:53,473
Board our boat and find peace of mind.

816
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:15,412
What a beautiful summer moon.

817
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,957
We like full moons.

818
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:25,756
Let us pray to this moon for success.

819
01:05:25,881 --> 01:05:28,634
Shall we?

820
01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:46,318
The raccoons began intense training for Operation Goblin.

821
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:08,131
Congratulations on your 999th birthday!

822
01:06:09,977 --> 01:06:12,459
Thank you, everyone.

823
01:06:12,479 --> 01:06:14,961
Thank you.

824
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:19,726
Master, please perform that scene from the Battle of Yashima!

825
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:22,980
Of course, why not.

826
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:11,403
The time is ripe.

827
01:07:25,927 --> 01:07:26,971
Pom Poke Year 33.

828
01:07:26,991 --> 01:07:28,035
Year's end.

829
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:31,673
Operation Goblin was about to begin.

830
01:07:32,184 --> 01:07:34,353
Slightly cloudy, no wind.

831
01:07:34,373 --> 01:07:36,542
Cool but not cold, humidity 65%.

832
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:38,847
A perfect day for goblins.

833
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:20,222
From ancient times, raccoons have been skilled at transformation.

834
01:08:20,524 --> 01:08:22,652
But this time was different.

835
01:08:22,672 --> 01:08:24,800
Not only their energy...

836
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:29,314
but the energy of the cosmos itself had to be harnessed...

837
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,943
to guarantee the success of Operation Goblin.

838
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:38,073
Accumulating and channeling that energy was vital.

839
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:40,492
Under the direction of the Three Masters...

840
01:08:40,659 --> 01:08:45,747
the raccoons generated an indescribable amount of power.

841
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:49,751
Males, females, skilled and unskilled alike...

842
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:53,630
all contributed their energy.

843
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:59,970
That evening, the raccoons united...

844
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:08,603
to use their full strength as it had never been seen before.

845
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,651
Hey look!

846
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,116
What's that?

847
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:41,803
Let the trees blossom in the middle of winter!

848
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:07,866
Wow, a big parade of goblins!

849
01:12:08,418 --> 01:12:11,943
I used to see those sorts of things.

850
01:12:11,963 --> 01:12:15,488
Like a parade of foxes.

851
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:19,627
I know, I saw them too.

852
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:24,966
With little lanterns and everything.

853
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:29,846
And the lanterns would go marching along.

854
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:38,897
I wonder what that was all about?

855
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,858
Can foxes really do that?

856
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,944
It sure seems like they can.

857
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:51,242
I mean, you can see them.

858
01:12:51,378 --> 01:12:53,756
It's just nerves.

859
01:12:53,776 --> 01:12:56,154
All this talk about goblins.

860
01:12:56,289 --> 01:13:00,710
All those old stories about foxes and lanterns.

861
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:04,923
It's all in your head.

862
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:11,054
You just think you saw them marching.

863
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:14,182
Your mind plays tricks.

864
01:13:16,694 --> 01:13:19,427
Of course.

865
01:13:19,447 --> 01:13:22,180
It's foolish to believe it.

866
01:13:22,357 --> 01:13:26,069
The human mind is a frightening thing.

867
01:13:26,871 --> 01:13:30,021
You're sure they're real.

868
01:13:30,041 --> 01:13:33,191
But they can't be real.

869
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:38,581
Those are real.

870
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:43,420
They're all in your mind.

871
01:13:48,383 --> 01:13:49,759
Welcome home.

872
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:53,221
Sachiko!

873
01:14:41,019 --> 01:14:43,646
I summon the six elements!

874
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:54,657
Form is emptiness!

875
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:10,984
Master Gyobu!

876
01:16:23,705 --> 01:16:25,206
That was scary.

877
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:30,628
Aw, is it over already?

878
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:33,172
That was so cool!

879
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:36,384
It's time for bed.

880
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:38,386
All right.

881
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:43,600
And brush your teeth.

882
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:49,772
I feel like I was dreaming.

883
01:16:49,907 --> 01:16:51,722
Me too.

884
01:16:51,742 --> 01:16:53,557
What could that have been?

885
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:56,946
Maybe UFOs are real too.

886
01:16:57,697 --> 01:16:59,949
Strange things really do happen.

887
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:09,125
Long ago, when the Matsuyama Clan was at war...

888
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:14,714
Gyobu defected to the enemy, causing the downfall of his clan.

889
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:19,260
He regretted it so deeply, that he made a solemn vow...

890
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:21,763
to fight for justice.

891
01:17:21,939 --> 01:17:25,089
His death must not be in vain.

892
01:17:25,109 --> 01:17:28,259
Let us carry on his noble ideals.

893
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:32,273
We will fight to the end, until the day of triumph.

894
01:17:32,408 --> 01:17:39,291
Ga-te ga-te para-ga-te Raccoons of the Sweetcake Hills Victory is ours!

895
01:17:39,311 --> 01:17:46,194
We drink lots of sake and transform.

896
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:49,832
Operation Goblin was a big success!

897
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:56,464
But with all the excitement, they forgot to monitor the news.

898
01:17:56,756 --> 01:18:01,969
We're looking for video of this mysterious parade.

899
01:18:02,105 --> 01:18:04,817
No one has come forward yet.

900
01:18:04,837 --> 01:18:07,549
Investigators are perplexed.

901
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:12,522
I shot all that video, but none of it came out.

902
01:18:12,647 --> 01:18:14,482
This is really weird.

903
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:20,738
The goblin slipped in through here and it was terrifying!

904
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,491
Nobody could have faked that.

905
01:18:24,617 --> 01:18:27,870
Something fishy is going on in New Town.

906
01:18:28,496 --> 01:18:31,332
I wish I could move, but...

907
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:35,420
At 12:20 tonight, we will bring you a special program...

908
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:38,256
with in-depth coverage of this mystery.

909
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:52,186
As the humans investigate what happened...

910
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:57,108
they will realize that this wasn't their imagination.

911
01:18:57,275 --> 01:19:00,820
They'll be face to face with reality.

912
01:19:01,154 --> 01:19:05,450
Then, when they realize that their science and logic...

913
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:09,245
are powerless to unlock the riddle...

914
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:14,709
They will be dumbfounded by the mystery of the cosmos...

915
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:20,715
and realize how insignificant humanity really is.

916
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:25,678
Good fortune awaits us, but let's not wait for it.

917
01:19:25,813 --> 01:19:28,420
Let's wake it up.

918
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:31,047
Let's celebrate!

919
01:19:31,194 --> 01:19:32,078
Drink up!

920
01:19:32,098 --> 01:19:32,982
Sing!

921
01:19:33,002 --> 01:19:33,886
Dance!

922
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:41,152
But the next day...

923
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:45,323
things took an unexpected turn.

924
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:51,662
Last night's unauthorized parade in Tama New Town...

925
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:57,251
was a publicity stunt for Wonderland theme park, now under construction.

926
01:19:57,919 --> 01:20:01,380
The police investigation is ongoing.

927
01:20:01,506 --> 01:20:02,590
Nonsense!

928
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:09,263
However, local residents confirm that it didn't look like a publicity event.

929
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:11,474
Of course not!

930
01:20:11,891 --> 01:20:17,063
The president of Wonderland confessed to last night's stunt.

931
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:18,564
What?

932
01:20:19,232 --> 01:20:28,074
I would like to apologize to the public for this disturbance.

933
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:29,492
He's crazy!

934
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:35,373
We are still working on the construction of Wonderland.

935
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:40,670
But to let everyone know what a splendid park we're building...

936
01:20:40,795 --> 01:20:47,677
we decided to provide some free entertainment.

937
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:56,727
As president of the park, I ordered the surprise parade.

938
01:20:56,904 --> 01:20:57,885
- Liar!

939
01:20:57,905 --> 01:20:58,886
- What's he talking about!

940
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:04,777
Fortunately, we've received an enormous outpouring...

941
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:09,240
of enthusiastic praise and support from the public.

942
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:15,496
We are overwhelmed at the enormous response.

943
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:19,625
If they must lock me up for this...

944
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:25,256
I'm prepared to pay the price.

945
01:21:26,809 --> 01:21:28,311
- What the...

946
01:21:28,331 --> 01:21:29,833
- Why?

947
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:32,263
Something is very wrong here!

948
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:36,267
If they must lock me up for this...

949
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,102
That fool!

950
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:43,900
The news threw the raccoons into a panic.

951
01:21:44,442 --> 01:21:49,530
Meanwhile, Wonderland's boss searched for the parade's organizers.

952
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,490
Just find them.

953
01:21:51,626 --> 01:21:54,004
I want the organizers.

954
01:21:54,024 --> 01:21:56,402
I don't care what it takes.

955
01:21:56,714 --> 01:21:58,883
I'll pay them whatever they ask.

956
01:21:58,903 --> 01:22:01,072
As much as it takes!

957
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:02,835
It was raccoons.

958
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:03,931
What?

959
01:22:03,951 --> 01:22:04,912
Then get me a raccoon!

960
01:22:05,056 --> 01:22:07,643
Any raccoon.

961
01:22:07,663 --> 01:22:10,250
Contact their manager!

962
01:22:11,771 --> 01:22:13,565
Raccoons?

963
01:22:13,585 --> 01:22:15,379
What did you say?

964
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:17,725
I was only joking.

965
01:22:18,110 --> 01:22:20,030
Who are you?

966
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:21,970
How did you get in here?

967
01:22:22,114 --> 01:22:23,957
Your secretary.

968
01:22:23,977 --> 01:22:25,820
I phoned earlier.

969
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,683
My name's Ryutaro.

970
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:32,073
You seem to be in a tight spot.

971
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:38,329
But only I can contact the people who staged that parade.

972
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:42,416
All right, I'll give you a million dollars.

973
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:49,757
While this mysterious stranger explained his proposal...

974
01:22:49,924 --> 01:22:55,930
the raccoons were enraged that their glory had been stolen.

975
01:22:56,055 --> 01:23:01,602
They cried with resentment and sank into helplessness.

976
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:08,025
And since there was no video of the goblin parade...

977
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:12,154
media coverage tapered off.

978
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:28,713
You're a fox, aren't you?

979
01:23:31,308 --> 01:23:34,688
Precisely.

980
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:38,088
I'm Ryutaro, transforming fox of Tama.

981
01:23:40,141 --> 01:23:43,769
I've heard many tales of the Great Kincho from Shikoku.

982
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:45,396
This is an honor.

983
01:23:45,573 --> 01:23:48,827
My ancestors were far greater than I.

984
01:23:48,847 --> 01:23:52,101
So tell me, why are you here?

985
01:23:52,403 --> 01:23:55,364
I was deeply moved by your fabulous parade.

986
01:23:55,823 --> 01:23:57,992
You knew it was us?

987
01:23:58,461 --> 01:24:00,902
Indeed.

988
01:24:00,922 --> 01:24:03,363
And I understand your despair and discouragement.

989
01:24:03,998 --> 01:24:10,755
I see, I suppose as a fox you would understand.

990
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:15,009
And I knew things would turn out this way.

991
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,261
You did?

992
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:21,640
Ryutaro invited Kincho to join him in Ginza...

993
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:26,312
in a private room at a certain well-known club.

994
01:24:26,437 --> 01:24:28,105
Welcome!

995
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:33,235
Don't worry, all these ladies are foxes.

996
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:40,326
Would you prefer them as foxes?

997
01:24:40,618 --> 01:24:43,579
Or shall I have them change into raccoons?

998
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,084
Let's be frank.

999
01:24:48,385 --> 01:24:50,867
Raccoons have no future in Tama.

1000
01:24:50,887 --> 01:24:53,369
The foxes already died out.

1001
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:56,509
The foxes died out already?

1002
01:24:56,644 --> 01:24:58,153
Yes.

1003
01:24:58,173 --> 01:24:59,682
It's a pity.

1004
01:24:59,702 --> 01:25:01,211
Now only a few of us...

1005
01:25:01,472 --> 01:25:05,226
survive as humans, like this.

1006
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:06,727
Humans?

1007
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:10,272
It's the key to survival in the big city.

1008
01:25:10,648 --> 01:25:16,112
I invited you here to persuade you raccoons to do likewise.

1009
01:25:16,237 --> 01:25:17,780
Just a moment!

1010
01:25:17,915 --> 01:25:19,897
I understand your shock.

1011
01:25:19,917 --> 01:25:21,899
But times like these...

1012
01:25:22,368 --> 01:25:24,745
call for drastic measures.

1013
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:27,957
You must bear the unbearable.

1014
01:25:28,082 --> 01:25:33,754
Your only hope for survival is to get jobs at Wonderland.

1015
01:25:33,963 --> 01:25:38,759
What, and go to work for our enemy?

1016
01:25:39,228 --> 01:25:41,565
Let's think calmly.

1017
01:25:41,585 --> 01:25:43,922
At this point raccoons have no choice.

1018
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:45,975
That much is given.

1019
01:25:46,443 --> 01:25:49,030
Living as a human fakes big money.

1020
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:51,637
Ano' how do you earn a living?

1021
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:54,859
You use the talents you have.

1022
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:58,821
The question is which job would pay the best money.

1023
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,616
Unfortunately Wonderland pays the best rates.

1024
01:26:03,117 --> 01:26:05,619
And the benefits are considerable.

1025
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:07,872
This is the salary...

1026
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:11,000
and these are the benefits.

1027
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:16,505
Of course, only I will know that you're raccoons.

1028
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:21,886
Bon appÃ©tit.

1029
01:26:23,397 --> 01:26:26,589
Let's think about it over dinner.

1030
01:26:26,609 --> 01:26:29,801
Enjoy the food, Master Kincho.

1031
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:33,731
You must be tired of scraps from the garbage in Tama.

1032
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:35,149
That's not important.

1033
01:26:36,317 --> 01:26:38,360
I have one question.

1034
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:45,034
If we must live as humans, what about those who can't transform?

1035
01:26:45,159 --> 01:26:47,286
They have to fend for themselves.

1036
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:52,666
At least the strongest ones will survive.

1037
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:56,754
We too had to abandon our weaker members.

1038
01:26:56,921 --> 01:26:59,548
And they... perished.

1039
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:01,374
Yes.

1040
01:27:01,394 --> 01:27:02,918
It was a heart-wrenching decision.

1041
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:08,265
What a tragedy!

1042
01:27:09,652 --> 01:27:12,509
But you raccoons are lucky.

1043
01:27:12,529 --> 01:27:15,386
You can eat just about anything.

1044
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:18,192
I wouldn't worry too much.

1045
01:27:18,776 --> 01:27:21,111
In Kincho's absence...

1046
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:26,700
the Tama raccoons gathered to decide what to do next.

1047
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:29,453
But only a handful showed up.

1048
01:27:31,372 --> 01:27:33,791
They talked big but they didn't deliver.

1049
01:27:34,959 --> 01:27:38,295
We never should have waited for them.

1050
01:27:38,806 --> 01:27:45,584
I say, âDon't sell the pelt until you've skinned the raccoon.â Not even Buddha could help us.

1051
01:27:45,604 --> 01:27:52,382
We must not blame the Masters.

1052
01:27:52,518 --> 01:27:59,358
âTricky like a raccoon.â That's what humans call someone like the president of Wonderland.

1053
01:27:59,525 --> 01:28:02,861
You talk about humans too much, Shokichi!

1054
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:06,699
I'm just trying to learn more about them.

1055
01:28:06,834 --> 01:28:08,774
Shut up!

1056
01:28:08,794 --> 01:28:10,734
We must kill all the humans!

1057
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:12,663
Control yourself, Gonta.

1058
01:28:12,997 --> 01:28:19,003
Our only choice is to tell the humans...

1059
01:28:19,128 --> 01:28:23,424
that Operation Goblin was the work of us raccoons.

1060
01:28:23,726 --> 01:28:26,501
Have you lost your mind?

1061
01:28:26,521 --> 01:28:29,296
That's just what we mustn't do.

1062
01:28:29,606 --> 01:28:32,506
She's right.

1063
01:28:32,526 --> 01:28:35,426
If they find out, they'll come after us.

1064
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:38,522
But it's so tragic.

1065
01:28:38,699 --> 01:28:40,806
That parade was a work of art.

1066
01:28:40,826 --> 01:28:42,933
Why can't we take the credit?

1067
01:28:43,277 --> 01:28:45,195
I can't bear this.

1068
01:28:45,789 --> 01:28:48,522
I want to shout it out!

1069
01:28:48,542 --> 01:28:51,275
We are the ones who did it!

1070
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:54,079
But Tsurukame...

1071
01:28:54,455 --> 01:28:57,583
how would we get them to believe us?

1072
01:28:58,042 --> 01:29:01,045
We should make a public declaration.

1073
01:29:01,295 --> 01:29:04,715
Call the TV stations or send letters.

1074
01:29:06,133 --> 01:29:09,720
They'll probably think it's just a prank.

1075
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:13,682
Then we'll go on TV and show them our transformations.

1076
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:15,351
That's ridiculous.

1077
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:19,730
They'll say it's just a trick and we'll be humiliated.

1078
01:29:20,064 --> 01:29:22,107
This is a waste of time.

1079
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:24,109
This much was true.

1080
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:28,364
The debate went back and forth, and on into the night.

1081
01:29:30,324 --> 01:29:32,951
This whole discussion is a waste of time.

1082
01:29:33,077 --> 01:29:39,583
But if we turn terrorist, the humans will kill us all.

1083
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:43,087
That's why we shouldn't reveal our secret.

1084
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:46,006
Then there's not much we can do.

1085
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:54,348
Our only hope is to stick together.

1086
01:29:54,473 --> 01:29:56,266
We've got to try again.

1087
01:29:56,433 --> 01:30:00,270
We've got to launch Operation Goblin 2.

1088
01:30:01,365 --> 01:30:03,493
What's the point?

1089
01:30:03,513 --> 01:30:05,641
It'll fail the same way.

1090
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:09,905
We'll perfect a new plan and a new strategy.

1091
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:13,909
You just don't want to do anything.

1092
01:30:14,201 --> 01:30:17,955
You're like some stinking girl.

1093
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:20,010
Watch your language, Gonta.

1094
01:30:20,030 --> 01:30:21,950
Girls don't stink.

1095
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:25,796
Well if they did, he'd be one.

1096
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:29,716
I'm going to get ready for Operation Goblin 2.

1097
01:30:30,134 --> 01:30:32,219
And who will follow you?

1098
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:34,972
Who's going to follow you?

1099
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:38,892
You watch your mouth!

1100
01:30:39,643 --> 01:30:40,519
Knock it off.

1101
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:45,023
Listen everyone!

1102
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:49,987
There's only one way for us to avoid conflict...

1103
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:55,909
and it requires the use of our special talents.

1104
01:30:57,327 --> 01:31:01,623
Our powers overwhelmed the humans in Operation Goblin.

1105
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:07,796
But unfortunately, they thought it was the work of men with inhuman talents.

1106
01:31:08,422 --> 01:31:10,924
Then what should we do?

1107
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,930
We have to be creative.

1108
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:22,478
Like Columbus and his famous boiled egg.

1109
01:31:25,782 --> 01:31:26,735
- Wow!

1110
01:31:26,755 --> 01:31:27,708
That's great!

1111
01:31:27,728 --> 01:31:28,681
- Bravo!

1112
01:31:29,276 --> 01:31:30,944
Is your plan that creative?

1113
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:38,285
From now on, we will live as inhuman humans.

1114
01:31:39,745 --> 01:31:41,663
You must be joking.

1115
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:44,833
No, this is no joke.

1116
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,877
But what about the others?

1117
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:49,046
Where did Tsurukame go?

1118
01:31:49,171 --> 01:31:58,555
APPEAL FROM THE RACCOONS While Tsurukame was absent from the meeting...

1119
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,684
Kincho's plan was rejected.

1120
01:32:03,018 --> 01:32:05,812
Raccoon solidarity started to unravel.

1121
01:32:07,064 --> 01:32:11,693
Most of the raccoons went back to gathering food.

1122
01:32:11,818 --> 01:32:16,657
Hard-line Gonta went around recruiting troops for his battle.

1123
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:21,036
Master Hage gathered the non-transforming raccoons...

1124
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:24,998
and gave them faith with a new dancing religion.

1125
01:32:26,093 --> 01:32:29,076
These are chaotic times.

1126
01:32:29,096 --> 01:32:32,079
All we can do is dance.

1127
01:32:32,214 --> 01:32:35,342
Save us, merciful Buddha.

1128
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:41,348
Look what has become of venerable Hage.

1129
01:32:41,807 --> 01:32:44,226
Tokyo is such a frightening place.

1130
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:49,523
In Shikoku, a parade like that would have an instant impact.

1131
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:56,446
Offerings at our shrine would go up five... no, ten times!

1132
01:32:56,863 --> 01:33:01,410
Master Kincho, take me back to Shikoku with you...

1133
01:33:01,545 --> 01:33:03,214
to continue my training.

1134
01:33:03,234 --> 01:33:04,903
I can't wait any longer.

1135
01:33:06,415 --> 01:33:08,792
Really, Tamasaburo?

1136
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:09,710
Yes.

1137
01:33:10,752 --> 01:33:13,630
You're ready to be my successor?

1138
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:15,465
Yes, Master Kincho.

1139
01:33:15,892 --> 01:33:18,374
I'm relieved to hear that.

1140
01:33:18,394 --> 01:33:20,876
But I have to ask you.

1141
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:23,724
You're not the kind of raccoon...

1142
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:28,812
who would abandon your comrades, are you?

1143
01:33:28,947 --> 01:33:30,449
Of course not.

1144
01:33:30,469 --> 01:33:31,971
But...

1145
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:33,984
But what?

1146
01:33:35,537 --> 01:33:38,374
You've lost everyone's support.

1147
01:33:38,394 --> 01:33:41,231
What can we possibly do?

1148
01:33:41,543 --> 01:33:42,837
We're not finished yet.

1149
01:33:42,857 --> 01:33:44,151
I'll show you.

1150
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:54,463
This is quite a fancy restaurant.

1151
01:33:54,588 --> 01:33:59,760
We spared no expense to please you.

1152
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:07,476
This is astounding.

1153
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:11,605
We'll be bigger than Disneyland!

1154
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:37,047
To get revenge on the president...

1155
01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:42,135
Kincho and the raccoons ruined his deal with Ryutaro.

1156
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:44,805
The president told the police...

1157
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:49,017
that raccoons had stolen a million dollars from him.

1158
01:34:49,142 --> 01:34:50,769
But they wouldn't listen.

1159
01:34:53,647 --> 01:34:57,192
That same day, Gonta's army began their operations...

1160
01:34:57,317 --> 01:35:01,154
to stop the next phase of development.

1161
01:35:18,672 --> 01:35:21,007
Attention eco-terrorists!

1162
01:35:21,258 --> 01:35:26,304
Stop interfering with development and leave these woods at once.

1163
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:30,058
You could be arrested for theft...

1164
01:35:30,183 --> 01:35:34,688
possession of dangerous weapons and illegal trespassing.

1165
01:35:36,273 --> 01:35:42,946
If you fail to evacuate immediately, we will use force to remove you.

1166
01:35:55,041 --> 01:36:01,256
Gonta's troops had the police and workers completely blocked.

1167
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:04,259
They refused to budge.

1168
01:36:04,468 --> 01:36:08,054
By nightfall, both sides were still holding their positions.

1169
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:20,609
If we can't stop Gonta, we have no choice but to help him.

1170
01:36:23,246 --> 01:36:26,479
The riot police are already there.

1171
01:36:26,499 --> 01:36:29,732
It's too late.

1172
01:36:34,748 --> 01:36:36,124
I'll check it out.

1173
01:36:36,676 --> 01:36:37,866
- Stop!

1174
01:36:37,886 --> 01:36:39,076
You'll be caught!

1175
01:36:39,096 --> 01:36:40,286
- We're going too!

1176
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:53,600
Everyone ready?

1177
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:59,981
In the spirit of honor, if we are sacrificed in battle...

1178
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:05,445
our brother raccoons will continue to fight...

1179
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:10,659
with undying determination until our day of victory.

1180
01:37:11,117 --> 01:37:25,048
Our raccoon balls Sway in the wind Back and forth To and fro Amen.

1181
01:37:25,183 --> 01:37:25,852
Special orders!

1182
01:37:25,872 --> 01:37:26,541
Stand aside!

1183
01:37:26,675 --> 01:37:28,176
Gonta, wait!

1184
01:37:28,635 --> 01:37:29,678
Let's go!

1185
01:37:46,903 --> 01:37:48,196
Gonta...

1186
01:38:29,863 --> 01:38:33,909
They used their balls in a last-ditch attack.

1187
01:38:34,711 --> 01:38:35,762
Mr.

1188
01:38:35,782 --> 01:38:36,833
Raccoon, Mr.

1189
01:38:36,853 --> 01:38:37,904
Raccoon.

1190
01:38:39,456 --> 01:38:42,375
Just then, in another part of the forest...

1191
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:45,253
a TV crew was searching for the raccoons.

1192
01:38:46,212 --> 01:38:48,214
Won't you please come out?

1193
01:38:48,465 --> 01:38:51,885
You can transform or come as you are.

1194
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:58,099
âWorld Telereporterâ is on your side!

1195
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:04,272
They seem quite reluctant.

1196
01:39:07,243 --> 01:39:08,780
Mr.

1197
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,337
Raccoon, Mr.

1198
01:39:10,357 --> 01:39:11,894
Raccoon Can we talk?

1199
01:39:12,072 --> 01:39:15,742
We have nothing to eat.

1200
01:39:15,919 --> 01:39:18,005
They answered!

1201
01:39:18,025 --> 01:39:20,111
The letter we received was genuine.

1202
01:39:21,049 --> 01:39:23,323
We want your side of the story.

1203
01:39:23,343 --> 01:39:25,617
Won't you come out?

1204
01:39:26,596 --> 01:39:28,182
Here they are!

1205
01:39:28,202 --> 01:39:29,788
It's the raccoons!

1206
01:39:30,423 --> 01:39:33,760
Are you really responsible for the goblin parade?

1207
01:39:33,927 --> 01:39:35,762
Yes, we are.

1208
01:39:37,389 --> 01:39:40,308
We want our viewers to believe you.

1209
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:45,605
Won't you give us a demonstration of your transforming talents?

1210
01:39:46,231 --> 01:39:49,985
Some of us raccoons can't transform.

1211
01:39:50,110 --> 01:39:54,322
We need our forest to live.

1212
01:40:02,288 --> 01:40:04,332
Please, raccoons.

1213
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:09,087
If you don't come out, no one will believe you.

1214
01:40:10,588 --> 01:40:14,009
After all, you contacted us.

1215
01:40:14,134 --> 01:40:17,345
Please stand behind your words.

1216
01:40:18,138 --> 01:40:19,305
Tsurukame!

1217
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:24,686
Please tell the humans our side of things.

1218
01:40:32,287 --> 01:40:34,540
There's one!

1219
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,813
He transformed into a raccoon statue!

1220
01:40:47,302 --> 01:40:48,659
Mr.

1221
01:40:48,679 --> 01:40:50,036
Raccoon, a word for our viewers.

1222
01:40:51,337 --> 01:40:55,550
We...We...

1223
01:40:56,009 --> 01:40:56,843
Yes?

1224
01:41:00,013 --> 01:41:02,182
Please go on.

1225
01:41:08,855 --> 01:41:11,524
We staged the parade!

1226
01:41:11,701 --> 01:41:14,017
This is our home!

1227
01:41:14,037 --> 01:41:16,353
Please don't take it away from us!

1228
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:19,824
This is the wish of all living things!

1229
01:42:02,992 --> 01:42:06,955
The people I saw yesterday are gone today.

1230
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:10,708
The people I see today will be gone tomorrow.

1231
01:42:11,584 --> 01:42:15,296
Nobody knows about the day after that.

1232
01:42:15,588 --> 01:42:18,424
But someday people will be sorry.

1233
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:23,096
999 years ago, the Battle of Yashima...

1234
01:42:23,221 --> 01:42:26,599
was witnessed by Hage...

1235
01:42:26,724 --> 01:42:29,018
the venerable Master of raccoons.

1236
01:42:29,154 --> 01:42:30,990
He had seen enough.

1237
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:32,846
He was ready to leave this world.

1238
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:38,111
With a song of triumph, they stretched his massive testicles...

1239
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:41,656
into a treasure ship adorned with lacquer and gold.

1240
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:49,497
He filled it with treasure, gold and jewels.

1241
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:54,127
Buddha would carry them from earth to heaven.

1242
01:42:54,961 --> 01:42:59,632
Singing and dancing, the non-transforming raccoons...

1243
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:04,512
boarded the ship for their journey to the shores of bliss.

1244
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:11,853
The treasure ship sailed down the Tama River...

1245
01:43:11,978 --> 01:43:16,482
beneath the moon, rocking and swaying.

1246
01:43:16,608 --> 01:43:21,821
The sail filled with wind and they steered for the sea.

1247
01:43:22,498 --> 01:43:24,397
The river foamed beneath the prow.

1248
01:43:24,417 --> 01:43:26,316
The moon glinted off the water.

1249
01:43:26,451 --> 01:43:30,496
The treasure ship sailed on, rocking under the moon.

1250
01:43:33,499 --> 01:43:37,795
It was like a dream, with bells, flutes and drums.

1251
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:44,302
Laden with raccoons, gold, silver and coral...

1252
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:49,057
the treasure ship sailed away down the river.

1253
01:43:49,182 --> 01:43:54,562
Before it sank beneath the waves, the others watched tearfully.

1254
01:43:56,481 --> 01:44:01,236
The ship entered the mist like a dream on a night in spring.

1255
01:44:01,361 --> 01:44:08,117
As they looked up at the moon, Buddha beckoned them to heaven.

1256
01:44:08,243 --> 01:44:13,081
And they crossed over to the other world.

1257
01:44:13,331 --> 01:44:17,418
All the raccoons perished on that journey of death.

1258
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:22,799
A journey with no return, a journey of death.

1259
01:44:22,924 --> 01:44:25,718
Poor raccoons, on a journey of death.

1260
01:44:29,514 --> 01:44:33,893
We're no match for the humans after all.

1261
01:44:54,841 --> 01:44:56,218
Bunta!

1262
01:44:56,238 --> 01:44:57,615
Is that Bunta?

1263
01:45:01,004 --> 01:45:02,171
Tamasaburo!

1264
01:45:07,228 --> 01:45:08,195
- It's good to see you back!

1265
01:45:08,215 --> 01:45:09,182
- Sasuke!

1266
01:45:09,202 --> 01:45:10,169
Shokichi!

1267
01:45:10,481 --> 01:45:13,068
What happened to the elder from Sado?

1268
01:45:13,088 --> 01:45:15,675
Master Danzaburo?

1269
01:45:16,602 --> 01:45:21,274
After searching all this time, I found that 45 years ago...

1270
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:26,029
he was shot by a hunter during the famine after the war.

1271
01:45:26,581 --> 01:45:28,688
I see.

1272
01:45:28,708 --> 01:45:30,815
I was hoping to meet him.

1273
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:34,370
Thanks for your hard work, Bunta.

1274
01:45:39,427 --> 01:45:42,097
Why is everything so different?

1275
01:45:42,117 --> 01:45:44,787
I've only been away three years.

1276
01:45:45,631 --> 01:45:47,842
We tried to stop them.

1277
01:45:47,977 --> 01:45:49,834
But nothing is the same.

1278
01:45:49,854 --> 01:45:51,711
Or have I gone crazy?

1279
01:45:51,888 --> 01:45:54,432
We know how you feel.

1280
01:45:54,557 --> 01:45:56,100
Was it the humans?

1281
01:45:56,601 --> 01:45:59,354
Yes, this is their work.

1282
01:45:59,614 --> 01:46:01,513
Impossible!

1283
01:46:01,533 --> 01:46:03,432
Only raccoons could be this tricky.

1284
01:46:03,452 --> 01:46:05,351
Not humans.

1285
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:08,654
Those humans cheated us.

1286
01:46:08,915 --> 01:46:10,938
They were raccoons after all.

1287
01:46:10,958 --> 01:46:12,981
Old, stinking raccoons!

1288
01:46:14,587 --> 01:46:16,027
Give us back our hills!

1289
01:46:16,047 --> 01:46:17,487
Give us back our fields!

1290
01:46:17,705 --> 01:46:21,000
Give us back our home!

1291
01:46:35,348 --> 01:46:36,891
Let's change it back.

1292
01:46:37,985 --> 01:46:40,092
Our final operation.

1293
01:46:40,112 --> 01:46:42,219
Make it the way it was.

1294
01:46:43,866 --> 01:46:46,223
Why not?

1295
01:46:46,243 --> 01:46:48,600
We could hit the humans with one last illusion.

1296
01:46:48,788 --> 01:46:52,313
Interesting.

1297
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:55,858
I can see the old scenery already.

1298
01:46:56,003 --> 01:46:57,818
All right.

1299
01:46:57,838 --> 01:46:59,653
One more try.

1300
01:46:59,872 --> 01:47:03,668
But, what would it prove to do something like that now?

1301
01:47:04,053 --> 01:47:05,472
Nothing.

1302
01:47:05,492 --> 01:47:06,911
But it will be amusing.

1303
01:47:07,056 --> 01:47:08,996
You're right.

1304
01:47:09,016 --> 01:47:10,956
A raccoon without a playful spirit...

1305
01:47:11,092 --> 01:47:13,052
is not a raccoon.

1306
01:47:13,386 --> 01:47:16,055
Will you help us too, Kincho?

1307
01:47:16,305 --> 01:47:20,560
Of course, if you don't mind a little southern flair.

1308
01:47:21,185 --> 01:47:22,395
Ponkichi!

1309
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:24,032
I'm here!

1310
01:47:24,052 --> 01:47:25,554
Let's gather everyone who's left.

1311
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:27,650
Can we count on you too?

1312
01:47:27,775 --> 01:47:29,068
Naturally!

1313
01:49:23,766 --> 01:49:26,519
Hey, wait for me!

1314
01:49:40,199 --> 01:49:42,702
Oh, that looks like Mother.

1315
01:49:45,214 --> 01:49:46,383
It's Yotchan.

1316
01:49:46,403 --> 01:49:47,572
Yotchan!

1317
01:50:16,819 --> 01:50:19,905
That's us when we were little!

1318
01:50:27,413 --> 01:50:28,956
Look, raccoons!

1319
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:31,959
Gosh, they're so cute!

1320
01:50:33,586 --> 01:50:35,254
Look Mom, raccoons!

1321
01:50:35,389 --> 01:50:37,642
They're still around.

1322
01:50:37,662 --> 01:50:39,915
Even in a place like this.

1323
01:50:43,929 --> 01:50:46,307
Wait, raccoons!

1324
01:50:50,436 --> 01:50:52,396
Aw, they left.

1325
01:50:53,230 --> 01:50:56,025
I wanted to feed them.

1326
01:50:56,192 --> 01:50:59,111
Can raccoons really change into something else?

1327
01:51:03,449 --> 01:51:05,826
So we lost our battle.

1328
01:51:06,243 --> 01:51:11,123
And development just goes on, as if we'd never existed.

1329
01:51:13,209 --> 01:51:16,504
Humans quickly forget how things used to be.

1330
01:51:16,796 --> 01:51:20,508
At least for them, life is comfortable.

1331
01:51:21,717 --> 01:51:26,681
Trendy new condominiums stand on Manpukuji Hill.

1332
01:51:27,181 --> 01:51:29,225
And as it turned out...

1333
01:51:29,392 --> 01:51:35,481
showing ourselves to the humans had one good effect.

1334
01:51:35,981 --> 01:51:38,401
They take better care of nature.

1335
01:51:38,526 --> 01:51:41,320
They set aside the last bits of forest...

1336
01:51:41,445 --> 01:51:44,240
and built a few parks.

1337
01:51:44,365 --> 01:51:49,578
âIn harmony with the raccoons,â as it said in the papers.

1338
01:51:50,506 --> 01:51:53,238
But for us it was too late.

1339
01:51:53,258 --> 01:51:55,990
We'd lost our home.

1340
01:51:56,585 --> 01:52:02,800
Some of us went over the mountain to live in a town called Machida.

1341
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:05,553
But there were raccoons there already...

1342
01:52:05,678 --> 01:52:07,555
and development was hurting them too.

1343
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:09,756
Many were killed on the road.

1344
01:52:09,776 --> 01:52:11,842
Life got harder and harder.

1345
01:52:14,687 --> 01:52:19,525
So we decided to bear the unbearable.

1346
01:52:32,673 --> 01:52:35,343
That's right.

1347
01:52:35,363 --> 01:52:38,033
Those of us who can transform...

1348
01:52:38,169 --> 01:52:40,713
are living as humans, just like the foxes.

1349
01:52:41,348 --> 01:52:43,101
I have a desk job.

1350
01:52:43,121 --> 01:52:44,874
My wife, Kiyo, works at a bar.

1351
01:52:45,718 --> 01:52:49,138
Some of us got greedy and made big money...

1352
01:52:49,305 --> 01:52:51,390
by working with the developers.

1353
01:52:51,682 --> 01:52:57,062
But most of us are tired and want to go back to the forest.

1354
01:52:58,355 --> 01:53:03,235
It's amazing that humans can actually live like this.

1355
01:53:03,569 --> 01:53:08,282
Some of us dropped out and survive on scraps...

1356
01:53:08,407 --> 01:53:12,161
from the bars and clubs of Shinjuku.

1357
01:53:19,251 --> 01:53:22,087
But what about Ponkichi and the other raccoons?

1358
01:53:49,406 --> 01:53:54,286
No matter how tough things get, raccoons are survivors.

1359
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:59,333
They bear things without complaint and live happily and freely.

1360
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:04,672
They have children with a carefree spirit, and then they die.

1361
01:54:53,846 --> 01:54:56,015
Ponkichi!

1362
01:54:58,183 --> 01:55:00,144
Shokichi!

1363
01:55:03,198 --> 01:55:04,638
- Welcome back!

1364
01:55:04,658 --> 01:55:06,098
- You haven't changed a bit!

1365
01:55:28,172 --> 01:55:30,966
On TV, they're saying that foxes and raccoons...

1366
01:55:31,091 --> 01:55:34,720
have disappeared because of urban sprawl.

1367
01:55:34,845 --> 01:55:36,722
Could you stop saying that?

1368
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:41,727
Of course, some raccoons and foxes can transform.

1369
01:55:42,394 --> 01:55:45,731
But what about the rabbits and the other animals?

1370
01:55:46,398 --> 01:55:48,776
Some of us can't just disappear.

1371
01:56:12,925 --> 01:59:25,097
