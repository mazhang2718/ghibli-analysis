2
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:35,397
Thanks.

3
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,859
Aren't you tired?

4
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,741
All right.

5
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,867
We're almost there.

6
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,380
Mei, hide!

7
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,225
It wasn't a policeman.

8
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:33,351
Hello.

9
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,750
Are your parents around?

10
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,094
Thanks.

11
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:42,214
I'm Kusakabe!

12
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:44,176
We've just arrived!

13
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,186
A pleasure to meet you!

14
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,983
Welcome!

15
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,823
Thank you.

16
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,467
Here we are!

17
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,637
Wait!

18
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,107
Mei, there's a bridge!

19
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,316
A bridge?

20
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:33,559
See that flash?

21
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:34,731
Fish too!

22
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,236
So, you like it here?

23
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,036
Dad, it's terrific!

24
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,867
Look, a tunnel of trees!

25
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,539
Is that our house?

26
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,260
Come on!

27
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,313
It's a wreck!

28
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,856
Wreck!

29
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,525
Looks like a haunted house!

30
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,363
Haunted?

31
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,364
And it's all rotten!

32
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,760
It's gonna fall down!

33
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,550
Fall down!

34
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,190
Look, Mei!

35
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,898
See?

36
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,746
It's huge.

37
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,838
Dad, there's a huge tree!

38
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,424
It's a camphor tree.

39
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,420
Camphor tree...

40
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,601
Oops!

41
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,142
An acorn!

42
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,778
Show me.

43
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,774
Another one!

44
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,289
One for me!

45
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:53,532
Out of the way.

46
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:54,829
I can't open the screens.

47
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,624
Acorns!

48
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,128
There's acorns in the house.

49
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,629
They dropped from up there!

50
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,137
Maybe there are squirrels in here.

51
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,063
Squirrels, really?

52
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,978
Or rats that like acorns.

53
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,648
I'd rather have squirrels!

54
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,146
Where shall I put this?

55
00:07:18,823 --> 00:07:21,056
Here, I'll get the door for you.

56
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:23,309
Satsuki, open up the kitchen.

57
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,532
It's just round the back.

58
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,161
Mei, come on!

59
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,164
Wait for me!

60
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,251
Hurry!

61
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,418
Ready?

62
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,133
Bathtubs.

63
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,523
There's nothing here.

64
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,023
That's the bathroom.

65
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,942
Dad, there's something in here.

66
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,904
A squirrel?

67
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:44,327
Dunno.

68
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:46,768
A bunch of black things but not roaches or mice.

69
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,449
Really?

70
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,207
Can you see 'em?

71
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,298
I think they were...dustbunnies.

72
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:06,078
'Dustbunnies'?

73
00:09:06,098 --> 00:09:07,455
Like in my picture book?

74
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:09,166
That's right.

75
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:10,878
Ghosts don't come out on days like this.

76
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:21,778
When you walk into a dark room from outside, your eyes dim and so the dustbunnies come out.

77
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,320
I see.

78
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:27,145
Come here, dustbunnies.

79
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:30,445
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

80
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:38,155
Let's get to work!

81
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:40,328
See if you can find how to get upstairs.

82
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,926
Get up there and open all the windows.

83
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,461
Sure!

84
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,963
I'm coming, too!

85
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,106
Toilet!

86
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,559
Not here!

87
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,207
Nothing here!

88
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,338
Nothing!

89
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,267
Mei, it's here!

90
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,476
It's pitch black!

91
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,352
Dustbunnies...

92
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,953
Another acorn.

93
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:04,043
Come out, dustbunnies!

94
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:45,321
Are you there, Mr.

95
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:47,158
Dustbunny?

96
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,661
Dad, there's definitely something here!

97
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:19,900
That's exciting!

98
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,949
I've always wanted to live in a haunted house.

99
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,251
I'm coming!

100
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:13,785
I got it.

101
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:14,997
Satsuki!

102
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,605
Mei.

103
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,159
You're full of energy!

104
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:44,673
This is 'Nanny'.

105
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:46,909
She looks after the house and came to help.

106
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,043
I'm Satsuki and this is my sister, Mei.

107
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,918
Nice to meet you both.

108
00:13:53,916 --> 00:14:00,344
I'd have cleaned up if I'd known you'd be this quick.

109
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,725
No, you've done plenty.

110
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:08,273
Lately I've been so busy in the rice paddies, I only did a bit of dusting...

111
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,478
What have you done to your hands?

112
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,855
The dustbunny got away...

113
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,777
Your feet, too!

114
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,911
Mine are black, too!

115
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,132
That must be the 'soot spreaders'.

116
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:40,632
Those little, black, fuzzy things that fly?

117
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,835
That's right.

118
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:49,050
They breed in empty old houses, and cover them with soot and dust.

119
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:53,928
I could see them when I was little.

120
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:57,643
Now you can too, huh?

121
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,274
Are they like goblins or something?

122
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,862
Naah, nothing so scary.

123
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:09,243
If you keep smiling, they'll soon leave the house.

124
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:15,131
They're probably deciding where to go next, right now.

125
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,846
Mei, they're going away.

126
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:23,840
That's no fun.

127
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,434
What happens if a huge one comes out, like this?

128
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,140
I wouldn't be scared.

129
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,144
Okay then, I won't walk you to the bathroom at night.

130
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:37,031
Okay, cleaning time.

131
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:39,597
Could you get some water from the stream?

132
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,777
From the stream?

133
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,990
I'm coming, too!

134
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,329
Mei, wait there.

135
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,674
Did you get a fish?

136
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,221
Nanny, it's coming out!

137
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,231
Good, keep pumping 'til the water gets cold.

138
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,024
Okay!

139
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,907
May I help you?

140
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,907
Huh... my Mom... for Granny.

141
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,113
Yes?

142
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,913
Wait, what is it?

143
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,712
Is that you, Kanta?

144
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:28,719
You live in a haunted house!

145
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,216
Kanta, stop it!

146
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,063
I did the same when I was his age.

147
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:46,181
I hate boys.

148
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:48,684
But I really love Nanny's rice cakes!

149
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,237
Eat as much as you want.

150
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,406
Thank you!

151
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,244
Thank you very much for your help.

152
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,756
Good bye!

153
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,368
Dad, the house is going to fall down.

154
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,540
I hope not; we've only just moved in.

155
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,915
Come on, let's laugh to keep the bogeymen away!

156
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,914
I'm not scared.

157
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:09,012
I mean it.

158
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:09,785
I'm not scared!

159
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,963
One-two, one-two...

160
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,635
Come on, keep up the good work...

161
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:07,403
Okay!

162
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:08,843
Washing...finished!

163
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,242
Here we go!

164
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,841
Nanny!

165
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,518
Hello!

166
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,012
Hard at work?

167
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,731
Where're you all heading?

168
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,017
To visit Mommy in the hospital!

169
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:52,594
That's nice.

170
00:21:52,614 --> 00:21:54,847
Give her my regards!

171
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,092
This way.

172
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:42,911
Hello.

173
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,697
Hello there.

174
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,408
Mommy!

175
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,002
So glad you came, my dear.

176
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,417
Daddy took the wrong road.

177
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:53,825
Really?

178
00:22:53,845 --> 00:22:55,247
Hello, Satsuki.

179
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,126
It's a school holiday, today.

180
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,594
How nice.

181
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,339
Daddy is talking to the doctor.

182
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,261
It's so good to see you all.

183
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,431
Have you settled into the new house?

184
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,151
A haunted house?

185
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,904
Mom, do you like ghosts?

186
00:23:17,156 --> 00:23:18,871
Of course I do!

187
00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:20,606
I can't wait to see them.

188
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,076
See, I told you Mei.

189
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,785
Mei was worried that you wouldn't like ghosts.

190
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,032
What about you two?

191
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,079
I love them!

192
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,917
I'm not scared of them!

193
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,964
Are you fixing Mei's hair, Satsuki?

194
00:23:37,134 --> 00:23:38,348
It's really good.

195
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:39,582
Lucky girl, Mei.

196
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,305
But she always gets mad at me.

197
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,095
That's 'cuz you won't stay still.

198
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,092
Come here, Satsuki.

199
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,641
Isn't yours too short?

200
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:50,889
No, I like it like this.

201
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:51,902
Do mine, Mommy!

202
00:23:51,922 --> 00:23:52,926
Mine, too!

203
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:53,808
Wait your turn!

204
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:59,397
Wavy hair, just like mine when I was your age.

205
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:03,321
Will it be like yours when I grow up?

206
00:24:03,786 --> 00:24:05,627
Probably.

207
00:24:05,647 --> 00:24:07,488
You take after your Mom.

208
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,266
Mom looked really well.

209
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:29,147
You're right.

210
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,047
The doctor says she'll be home soon.

211
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,524
Soon?

212
00:24:32,544 --> 00:24:33,338
Like tomorrow?

213
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,850
You always say this.

214
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,522
Tomorrow is a little too soon.

215
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,322
Mom said she'll sleep with me in my bed.

216
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:45,823
Weren't you saying you're big enough to sleep alone?

217
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,946
Mom is special!

218
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,933
Dad, time to get up!

219
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,143
Wake up!

220
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,317
Sorry, I overslept again...

221
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,239
I've got to bring a box lunch today.

222
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,578
I totally forgot about it.

223
00:25:31,123 --> 00:25:32,417
It's all right.

224
00:25:32,437 --> 00:25:33,731
I've made something for all of us.

225
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:34,708
It's burning!

226
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,542
I'm coming.

227
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,497
Here, this is yours, Mei.

228
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,667
It's for me?

229
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,052
Mei, sit down and eat!

230
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,256
Here, wrap yours.

231
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,262
Satsuki!

232
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,809
- oh.

233
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,433
I'm coming!

234
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,944
You made a friend already?

235
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,938
She's calling you!

236
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,073
Yup, that's Michiko.

237
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,906
Gotta go!

238
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,997
See ya!

239
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,283
See you later!

240
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:18,665
Morning!

241
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,959
Hi, let's go.

242
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,935
Daddy!

243
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,809
Do I look all grown up?

244
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:38,967
Yes dear.

245
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:40,139
And where might you be going?

246
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,938
I'm just going out.

247
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,508
Daddy, is it lunch yet?

248
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,753
Already?

249
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,442
You be the flower shop, Daddy.

250
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,038
Pole-tads!

251
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,227
Got no bottom.

252
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:16,741
Gotcha!

253
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:54,940
Who are you?

254
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,442
A big Dustbunny?

255
00:34:24,573 --> 00:34:26,101
To-to-ro?

256
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:27,649
You're Totoro!

257
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,915
I bet you're Totoro.

258
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,816
See you!

259
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,938
Okay, catch you later!

260
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,275
I'm home!

261
00:35:52,285 --> 00:35:53,727
Hey there.

262
00:35:53,747 --> 00:35:55,189
Is it that late already?

263
00:35:55,205 --> 00:35:56,209
Where's Mei?

264
00:35:56,229 --> 00:35:57,233
I'm off to Michiko's.

265
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,663
We haven't eaten yet. ls Mei in the garden?

266
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,545
Mei!

267
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,722
Dad, I found her hat!

268
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,339
Wake up, Mei!

269
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,093
You shouldn't sleep here!

270
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,255
Where's Totoro?

271
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,598
Totoro?

272
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,138
Where?

273
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,180
Were you dreaming?

274
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,898
Totoro was here.

275
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:08,109
You mean that troll in your picture book?

276
00:37:08,445 --> 00:37:12,015
Yeah.

277
00:37:12,035 --> 00:37:15,605
He was all hairy with a big mouth like this.

278
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:22,287
There's a tiny one and a little one and a huge one like this.

279
00:37:26,171 --> 00:37:27,863
There you are.

280
00:37:27,883 --> 00:37:29,575
Wow, this is amazing.

281
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,712
A great hiding place!

282
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,386
Dad, Mei said she met a Totoro here.

283
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,504
A Totoro?

284
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,302
It's this way.

285
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,357
Hey, wait for me!

286
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,645
Huh?!

287
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,023
Here?

288
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,320
No.

289
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,202
It went to a big tree.

290
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,288
But there wasn't any other path.

291
00:38:01,915 --> 00:38:03,209
Mei!

292
00:38:03,229 --> 00:38:04,523
Come back!

293
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:21,289
But it's true!

294
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:23,166
Totoro was here.

295
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,012
I'm not lying.

296
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,484
I know, Mei.

297
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,782
I didn't lie.

298
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:43,031
Neither of us think you're lying.

299
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,256
You probably met the king of this forest.

300
00:38:46,276 --> 00:38:48,992
You were very lucky.

301
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,668
He doesn't come out very often.

302
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,588
We should pay our respects at the shrine.

303
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,585
Pay our respects?

304
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,212
To this forest.

305
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,907
Mei, you're getting heavy.

306
00:39:18,908 --> 00:39:19,725
Daddy, look!

307
00:39:19,745 --> 00:39:20,562
That camphor tree!

308
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:22,948
What a big tree.

309
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,040
It's here!

310
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,706
Is that the tree?

311
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,092
Dad, hurry up.

312
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,056
The hole has gone.

313
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,432
Are you sure it was here?

314
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,102
The hole disappeared.

315
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,571
I told you he doesn't come to see us often.

316
00:39:58,823 --> 00:40:00,055
But will he come again?

317
00:40:00,075 --> 00:40:01,307
I want to meet him, too.

318
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:05,028
If you're lucky, sure.

319
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,997
What a beautiful tree.

320
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:14,003
This tree must have stood here for years and years.

321
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,301
Trees and people used to be good friends.

322
00:40:20,386 --> 00:40:23,808
I saw that tree and fell in love with the house.

323
00:40:23,828 --> 00:40:27,250
Hope Mom likes it, too.

324
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:30,812
Okay, let's pay our respects then get home for lunch.

325
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,477
Yes, I promised to go see Michiko.

326
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:34,941
I want to go, too!

327
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,316
Attention!

328
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:41,448
Thank you for looking after Mei.

329
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,658
Please take care of us.

330
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,610
Let's race home!

331
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,334
That's not fair!

332
00:40:46,354 --> 00:40:47,068
Dad!

333
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,161
Wait!

334
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,497
Hurry UP!

335
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,666
Wait for me!

336
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,458
Dear Mother, something amazing happened today.

337
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,512
Mei met a giant Totoro.

338
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:13,980
And I'm hoping to see him myself soon, too.

339
00:41:44,178 --> 00:41:45,768
Kanta, hurry up!

340
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:47,378
You'll be late!

341
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,381
Coming...

342
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,216
Mei?

343
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,097
Excuse me!

344
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,470
Yes, Satsuki?

345
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,889
It's my sister...

346
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,902
What happened, Nanny?

347
00:42:46,908 --> 00:42:49,164
I'm sorry.

348
00:42:49,184 --> 00:42:51,440
She insisted that she be with you.

349
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:56,495
It's Dad's day at the university.

350
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,495
You promised to be a good girl at Nanny's.

351
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:06,801
I still have two more classes and Nanny's too busy for this...

352
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:12,132
She was good up 'til now, weren't you?

353
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,687
I'll go talk to my teacher.

354
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:34,997
Since Satsuki's mother is in the hospital, I want you all to be nice to her.

355
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,458
What's that?

356
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,006
It's Totoro.

357
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,630
Mei, you should keep quiet.

358
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,673
okay.

359
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,481
Bye bye, Mei!

360
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,562
I can't stay after class today.

361
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,607
We'll let teacher know.

362
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,149
See you!

363
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,699
Hurry up, it's going to rain!

364
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:22,122
okay Here it comes!

365
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,222
Here.

366
00:44:39,228 --> 00:44:40,380
I won't cry.

367
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,552
Aren't I good?

368
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,726
It's getting worse...

369
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:52,274
Dear Guardian Spirit, let us stay until the rain stops.

370
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:37,159
But...

371
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,591
That was lucky.

372
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,848
It's got holes in it.

373
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:17,116
Daddy forgot his umbrella.

374
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,576
I'm going, too.

375
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,994
I said I forgot it!

376
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,369
What idiot forgets his umbrella on a rainy day?

377
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,290
Ouch!

378
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,835
You broke it playing, I bet.

379
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,128
I did not!

380
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,892
Excuse me.

381
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:51,272
Hello Satsuki.

382
00:46:51,292 --> 00:46:52,497
Hi, Mei.

383
00:46:52,517 --> 00:46:53,722
Grandma!

384
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,856
I'm sorry about Mei today.

385
00:46:56,866 --> 00:46:57,767
Not at all.

386
00:46:57,787 --> 00:46:58,688
Sorry we couldn't do more.

387
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,365
Kanta lent us this umbrella.

388
00:47:02,371 --> 00:47:04,188
He did?

389
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:06,025
A broken old thing like that!

390
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,785
Mei was with me, so I was glad.

391
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:12,414
But I'm so sorry that Kanta got wet.

392
00:47:12,715 --> 00:47:15,056
Not at all.

393
00:47:15,076 --> 00:47:17,417
It probably cleaned him up a little.

394
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,386
Are you off to meet your father?

395
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,254
YES.

396
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,722
What good girls you are.

397
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,216
Bye bye, Mei.

398
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,063
Who was that?

399
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:38,030
I don't know.

400
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,536
Just in time!

401
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,755
Getting on?

402
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,009
All right, drive on.

403
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,606
Daddy wasn't on it.

404
00:48:12,608 --> 00:48:14,761
He'll be on the next one.

405
00:48:14,781 --> 00:48:16,934
Why don't you wait at Nanny's?

406
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,231
Are you okay?

407
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,050
Sleepy?

408
00:49:29,977 --> 00:49:31,897
I told you.

409
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:33,837
Wanna go to Nanny's?

410
00:49:36,025 --> 00:49:36,904
It won't be much longer.

411
00:49:36,924 --> 00:49:37,803
Hang in there.

412
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,818
It's late...

413
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,451
Come on.

414
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,160
Are you Totoro?

415
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:32,097
Wait a minute.

416
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,180
You can use this.

417
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,600
Take it, Mei's slipping off.

418
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:50,608
Hold it like this.

419
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,776
Here's the bus!

420
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,966
He took Daddy's umbrella...

421
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,647
I'm sorry.

422
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:35,772
All right, drive on.

423
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,652
The train was late and I missed the bus.

424
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,037
Were you worried?

425
00:54:42,664 --> 00:54:43,771
We met him, Dad!

426
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:44,898
He was here!

427
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:46,659
And the cat bus!

428
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,167
What?

429
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,337
It was huge!

430
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:54,175
With big eyes like these!

431
00:54:55,302 --> 00:54:57,244
We met him!

432
00:54:57,264 --> 00:54:59,206
We met Totoro!

433
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,556
How wonderful!

434
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,478
Come on, Daddy.

435
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:26,408
Dear /I//other, I can '2' tell you how excited I was today.

436
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:31,207
it was the scariest, funniest day I've ever had.

437
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:33,626
Totoro gave us a lovely present...

438
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:38,378
wrapped in bamboo /eaves and tied with dragon whiskers.

439
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:43,383
when we opened it, it was full of magic nuts and seeds!

440
00:55:48,105 --> 00:55:54,534
'We decided to plant them in the garden to make a lovely forest.' But they haven 't sprouted yet.

441
00:55:54,554 --> 00:56:00,983
Mei sits there all day, waiting for them.

442
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:12,661
She looks like a little crab It's nearly summer vacation.

443
00:56:12,671 --> 00:56:14,802
Dearest, dear Mom, get well soon.

444
00:56:14,822 --> 00:56:16,953
Love, Satsuki.

445
00:56:20,512 --> 00:56:21,431
Come on.

446
00:56:21,451 --> 00:56:22,370
Bed time.

447
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,388
Lights off!

448
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,886
Wait, Dad.

449
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:32,105
Daddy, do you think they will sprout tomorrow?

450
00:56:32,441 --> 00:56:34,970
Well, I'm sure Totoro would know.

451
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:37,519
Night night.

452
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,737
Mei!

453
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,555
That's where we planted the seeds.

454
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,184
Wow, we did it!

455
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,387
We're the wind!

456
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:42,999
There are no trees!

457
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:53,923
yes It was a dream.

458
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:56,217
But it wasn't a dream.

459
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,885
We did it!

460
01:02:17,452 --> 01:02:19,268
Mr.

461
01:02:19,288 --> 01:02:21,104
Kusakabe!

462
01:02:21,124 --> 01:02:22,940
Telegram!

463
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,128
Anyone home?

464
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,175
Nanny.

465
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,802
I'm here.

466
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,807
This one is ripe.

467
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,529
What about this one?

468
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,027
That's good, too.

469
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:09,461
Your garden's a treasure house.

470
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:12,501
Let's take a little break.

471
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:21,298
These should be cold now.

472
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,300
Looks delicious.

473
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,186
So good.

474
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:40,033
The sun blessed these so they're really good for you.

475
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:42,444
Would they help my Mom, too?

476
01:03:42,454 --> 01:03:44,897
Of course.

477
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:47,360
If she eats my vegetables, she'll get better right away.

478
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,535
She's supposed to be back next Saturday.

479
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,583
She'll sleep in my bed!

480
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,760
At last.

481
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,200
That's wonderful.

482
01:03:56,217 --> 01:03:59,372
But it's only for a couple of days.

483
01:03:59,392 --> 01:04:02,547
To get used to the new house.

484
01:04:03,183 --> 01:04:05,228
I see.

485
01:04:05,248 --> 01:04:07,293
We'll feed her lots of vegetables, then.

486
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:10,727
I'll give her this corn I picked.

487
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:12,899
I'm sure she'll be very pleased.

488
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,734
Yes!

489
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,619
There was a telegram for you.

490
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:25,533
For us?

491
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:32,081
Dad won't be back till late, what shall I do?

492
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:35,080
Open it, it might be important.

493
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:42,805
PLEASE CONTACT, HOSPITAL...

494
01:04:43,181 --> 01:04:45,727
It's from Mom's hospital!

495
01:04:45,747 --> 01:04:48,293
Something's happened to her!

496
01:04:50,522 --> 01:04:51,611
Nanny!

497
01:04:51,631 --> 01:04:52,720
What shall I do?

498
01:04:52,732 --> 01:04:54,823
Calm down.

499
01:04:54,843 --> 01:04:56,934
Do you know where your Dad is?

500
01:04:56,935 --> 01:05:00,280
I know his office number, but we don't have a telephone.

501
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:04,492
Kanta, take her to use the phone in the main house!

502
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:12,705
Mei, stay here with me!

503
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,628
Stay with Nanny, Mei!

504
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:04,010
Hello, I'd like to make a long-distance call, please.

505
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:09,391
It's Tokyo 31 '1382.

506
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,891
A cute girl, Kanta.

507
01:06:16,524 --> 01:06:17,653
Hello?

508
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:18,802
Yes?

509
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:21,691
Hello, may I speak to Dad... er...

510
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,291
Mr.

511
01:06:23,311 --> 01:06:24,891
Kusakabe?

512
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,700
It's his daughter, Satsuki.

513
01:06:31,789 --> 01:06:32,731
Daddy?

514
01:06:32,751 --> 01:06:33,693
It's me, Satsuki!

515
01:06:34,042 --> 01:06:36,946
Hello, what's up?

516
01:06:36,966 --> 01:06:39,870
From the hospital?

517
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:42,715
Okay, /'// ca// them right away.

518
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:45,711
Is there anything wrong with Mom?

519
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:52,184
Don 't' worry. /'// check and call you right back.

520
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,345
I'm hanging up now, stay there.

521
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:01,352
May I stay here until he calls back?

522
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:04,066
Stay as long as you like.

523
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:13,580
Satsuki!

524
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:25,251
No, this corn is for my Mommy!

525
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,263
No, it's my Mom's!

526
01:07:46,364 --> 01:07:49,411
Listen Mei.

527
01:07:49,431 --> 01:07:52,478
Mom's not well so she's not coming home this time.

528
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,074
No!

529
01:07:55,373 --> 01:07:57,151
There's nothing we can do.

530
01:07:57,171 --> 01:07:58,949
You don't want her to get worse, do you?

531
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,747
No!

532
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,168
It's just for a few more days.

533
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,469
So you don't care if she dies, do you?

534
01:08:12,098 --> 01:08:13,250
Stop being silly!

535
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:14,422
I'm going.

536
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,477
Let's go, Mei.

537
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:33,652
I hate you, Satsuki!

538
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:04,103
We should bring the washing in...

539
01:09:04,734 --> 01:09:08,139
Don't worry too much, Satsuki.

540
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:11,564
Nanny's here to help, so cheer up.

541
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:19,573
Your Dad said he'll stop by the hospital to check on her.

542
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:27,005
Besides, it's just a cold; she'll be back next week.

543
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:35,214
They said it was just a cold...

544
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:37,841
when she went into hospital.

545
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,348
But what if she dies!

546
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:43,350
Don't be silly, Satsuki.

547
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,183
Maybe Mom will...

548
01:09:49,737 --> 01:09:53,204
Stop it.

549
01:09:53,224 --> 01:09:56,691
Nobody would leave two pretty little girls like you.

550
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,540
There, there.

551
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,480
Don't cry.

552
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:06,211
I'll be here until Daddy comes back, okay?

553
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:51,251
Mei!

554
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,808
Did she come back?

555
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:09,273
Wasn't she at the bus stop?

556
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:12,114
That's strange.

557
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:13,638
Where has she gone?

558
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:17,615
I was nasty to her, 'cause she was being silly...

559
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:20,826
Maybe she's heading for the hospital!

560
01:11:20,828 --> 01:11:23,834
The hospital?

561
01:11:23,854 --> 01:11:26,860
It would take a grown-up three hours!

562
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:27,662
I'll go look!

563
01:11:29,337 --> 01:11:32,804
Kanta, hurry!

564
01:11:32,824 --> 01:11:36,291
Tell your dad that Mei is missing!

565
01:11:45,394 --> 01:11:46,711
Stupid Mei.

566
01:11:46,731 --> 01:11:48,048
Always getting lost.

567
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,160
Excuse me.

568
01:12:09,085 --> 01:12:11,381
Have you seen a little girl pass by?

569
01:12:11,401 --> 01:12:13,697
She's my sister.

570
01:12:13,714 --> 01:12:16,368
No, I don't think so.

571
01:12:16,388 --> 01:12:19,042
I'm sure I would've noticed...

572
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,842
Maybe she wasn't here.

573
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,409
Are you sure she came this way?

574
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,074
I don't know.

575
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,652
Please, stop!

576
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:21,867
Jerk!

577
01:13:21,887 --> 01:13:22,556
What are you doing?!

578
01:13:22,575 --> 01:13:23,995
I'm looking for my sister.

579
01:13:24,015 --> 01:13:25,435
Have you seen a little girl?

580
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:27,324
Your little sister?

581
01:13:27,788 --> 01:13:29,543
She's four.

582
01:13:29,563 --> 01:13:31,318
I think she's heading to the hospital.

583
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,417
Did you see anyone?

584
01:13:33,419 --> 01:13:36,112
No.

585
01:13:36,132 --> 01:13:38,825
We just came from there... but we didn't see anyone.

586
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:41,755
Thanks anyway.

587
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:44,636
Where have you come from?

588
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,006
From Matsugo.

589
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,266
Really?

590
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:52,061
Good luck.

591
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:04,941
Satsuki!

592
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,703
Kanta!

593
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:10,488
Find her?

594
01:14:10,498 --> 01:14:11,315
No.

595
01:14:11,335 --> 01:14:12,152
And you?

596
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,129
Dad and the others are looking for her.

597
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:19,278
I'll go to the hospital, you go back home.

598
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:23,213
I guess she got lost on the way to the hospital.

599
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:26,512
They found a sandal by the pond.

600
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,643
We're not sure if it's hers or not!

601
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,371
Did you find her?

602
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:31,073
Dear Lord, please protect her and...

603
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:33,951
It's too deep here, better search further away!

604
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:36,074
Hey, are there any poles left?

605
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,963
Grandma, Satsuki's here!

606
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,383
Nanny!

607
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:56,435
Look, is it hers?

608
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:06,650
No, it isn't.

609
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:23,125
Thank heavens, I was sure it was hers.

610
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,090
Hey, Nanny was jumping to conclusions.

611
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,459
It's not hers!

612
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,715
Where's she gone then?

613
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,303
Let's start from scratch.

614
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:33,047
We better hurry, it'll be dark soon.

615
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:36,972
I really appreciate your help, everyone.

616
01:16:36,977 --> 01:16:37,981
Don't worry.

617
01:16:38,001 --> 01:16:39,005
Could have been any of us.

618
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:10,176
Please, help me Totoro!

619
01:17:10,177 --> 01:17:12,106
Mei is lost.

620
01:17:12,126 --> 01:17:14,055
It'll be dark soon.

621
01:17:14,075 --> 01:17:16,004
I'm sure she's scared somewhere...

622
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:47,963
Totoro!

623
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:53,886
Mei is lost and we can't find her!

624
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:59,893
She must be scared, please help me find her.

625
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:03,680
I don't know what to do...

626
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:03,994
They can't see the bus.

627
01:19:51,537 --> 01:20:18,151
FOREST-SWAMP CEMETERY-SHRINE MEI Mei!

628
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:29,036
The trees are moving out of the way!

629
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:08,580
Satsuki!

630
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,254
Mei!

631
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,177
You silly girl.

632
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:32,179
I'm sorry.

633
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:37,940
You wanted to take the corn to Mom?

634
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:51,995
HOSPITAL Will you take us to the hospital?

635
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:55,957
Thank you so much.

636
01:22:04,847 --> 01:22:07,165
I'm sorry.

637
01:22:07,185 --> 01:22:09,503
They didn't need to send a telegram just for a cold.

638
01:22:09,977 --> 01:22:12,130
The girls must be worried.

639
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:14,303
I'm sorry to upset them.

640
01:22:14,606 --> 01:22:15,985
They'll be fine.

641
01:22:16,005 --> 01:22:17,384
As long as you're okay.

642
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:19,907
We've all learned to cope.

643
01:22:19,927 --> 01:22:22,433
This'll just postpone the enjoyment.

644
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:27,656
They've put up with it so well.

645
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:30,655
I'm especially sorry for Satsuki, she's been so patient.

646
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:32,948
You're right.

647
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:37,829
I'm going to spoil them for a while when I come home.

648
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:38,795
No!

649
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,263
She's laughing!

650
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:50,007
Looks like she's fine.

651
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:01,235
I can't wait to get back on my feet.

652
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:11,862
look Where did that come from?

653
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:14,702
What?

654
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:19,041
I could swear I just saw Satsuki and Mei laughing up in that tree.

655
01:23:21,965 --> 01:23:23,072
Maybe they were too.

656
01:23:23,092 --> 01:23:24,199
Look.

657
