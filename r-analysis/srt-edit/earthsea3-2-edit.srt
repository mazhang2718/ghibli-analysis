1
00:00:06,835 --> 00:00:08,324
Arren!

2
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:09,833
I can't find Therru.

3
00:00:09,853 --> 00:00:11,342
Check the back pasture for me.

4
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:14,430
Tell her to come inside before dark.

5
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:15,867
I will.

6
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:34,874
Therru?

7
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:40,985
Therru...

8
00:00:41,226 --> 00:03:28,758
Far, far above the clouds against the setting sun A falcon flies alone soaring in the wind I hear his lonely cry so sad must he be Riding the silent wind a falcon flies alone Reaching out with his wings grasps the empty sky Riding the silent wind never can he rest What it is within my heart none can ever know A heart like a falcon's is this very heart What it is within my heart none can ever know Lonely falcon in the empty sky I walk alone along deserted country roads Walking with me side by side you are always there I feel your loneliness lonely you must be Crickets whispering in the grassy fields You walk there by my side you walk the path with me But you never say a word never do you speak What it is within my heart none can ever know Here inside this heart that walks its path alone What it is within my heart none can ever know The sadness of one who always is alone I killed my father.

9
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:33,057
I stabbed him and ran away.

10
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:35,119
I don't understand it.

11
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,984
Why did I kill him?

12
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:39,602
Did he hurt you?

13
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:41,892
No.

14
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:43,223
My father was a great man.

15
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:46,232
I am nothing.

16
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:48,633
I failed my father and I fail myself.

17
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,411
And yet, I'm filled with a rage I can't control.

18
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:59,553
It's as if there were someone else inside me.

19
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,682
You saw it too, didn't you?

20
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:04,166
You were right.

21
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:05,849
I shouldn't be here.

22
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,999
I'm sorry.

23
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:07,778
I didn't mean...

24
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,867
No, you were right.

25
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:15,097
If I don't leave, it will come again.

26
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:28,650
A woman?

27
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:31,415
She lives past the marshes.

28
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:35,419
And the Archmage is with her?

29
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:38,147
He was seen in the town.

30
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,411
There are many witnesses.

31
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:42,555
Splendid.

32
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:51,168
My lord.

33
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:55,139
Let's go, men!

34
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,719
A greeting from the Archmage.

35
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:19,448
Thank you, Sparrowhawk.

36
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:35,572
Therru!

37
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:36,569
Arren!

38
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:37,566
Dinner is ready!

39
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:39,653
Where's Arren?

40
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:42,515
Isn't he with you?

41
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:43,594
No.

42
00:05:44,205 --> 00:05:46,181
Maybe he's resting.

43
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:48,177
Therru, go see if he's there.

44
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:49,459
Yes, Tenar.

45
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,198
He's not here.

46
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:56,446
That's strange.

47
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:57,930
Where's he gone?

48
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,201
I'll look outside.

49
00:06:17,495 --> 00:06:18,860
Arren...

50
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,344
Tenar, Therru... take care.

51
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:04,430
Doesn't matter which way I go.

52
00:07:16,254 --> 00:07:17,619
Looks like a dead end.

53
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:39,470
It's here!

54
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,816
I wonder if that's Arren?

55
00:08:59,357 --> 00:09:00,585
Arren?

56
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:02,858
Sparrowhawk?

57
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:12,129
That's odd.

58
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:14,395
What are you doing?

59
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:16,842
It's you!

60
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:17,621
You're back!

61
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:22,779
So sorry, but it seems you'll do in place of the wizard.

62
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,574
What?

63
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:25,114
Tenar, what's wrong?

64
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:26,080
Run away!

65
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:27,775
What a surprise!

66
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:31,252
Fancy meeting you here, princess.

67
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:34,727
No!

68
00:09:34,747 --> 00:09:35,773
Leave her alone!

69
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,701
Therru!

70
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,696
Well now princess, where's your prince?

71
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:50,793
Hey!

72
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:51,589
Watch those teeth!

73
00:09:52,052 --> 00:09:54,313
I need you to deliver a message.

74
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,594
Tell this to the wizard!

75
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:59,375
If he wants his woman...

76
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:03,510
...he can find her at Lord Cob's castle.

77
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:05,522
Take her away!

78
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:06,487
Therru!

79
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,353
Tenar!

80
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:11,263
Let me go, I tell you!

81
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:13,243
Let me go!

82
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:18,734
Therru!

83
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:19,610
Are you all right?

84
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,486
Therru!

85
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:21,774
Stop it!

86
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:22,820
Let her go!

87
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,934
You stay here and be good till the wizard gets back!

88
00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:30,803
Lord Cob's waiting.

89
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:31,969
Let's get moving!

90
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,712
Tenar!

91
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,387
Tenar!

92
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:14,629
I'm sorry.

93
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,512
I'm afraid he's coming with me.

94
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:22,762
Go!

95
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,021
Where am I?

96
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:54,617
You're safe now.

97
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:56,915
The Shadow can't follow you here.

98
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,233
You saw it?

99
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,939
I know a bit of Magic myself.

100
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,235
I know what you're running from.

101
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:10,404
You were wise to flee from that man.

102
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:12,438
What man?

103
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,474
Sparrowhawk.

104
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:16,408
That is, the Archmage.

105
00:12:17,498 --> 00:12:19,395
Here, drink this.

106
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:21,312
It will soothe you.

107
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:27,465
What's wrong?

108
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:29,211
It's not poisoned.

109
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:47,715
Now lie still and rest here for a bit.

110
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:52,318
The Archmage is more dangerous than you can imagine.

111
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:54,415
No...

112
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:55,883
Sparrowhawk is a good man.

113
00:12:55,993 --> 00:12:58,325
He protected me.

114
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:01,319
Then tell me.

115
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,685
Did you ever wonder what he seeks?

116
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,696
No.

117
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,336
He seeks eternal life.

118
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:15,835
Eternal life?

119
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:21,273
The Archmage stands at the pinnacle of sorcery.

120
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:26,648
Only the secret of eternal life lies beyond his grasp.

121
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:29,991
And yet, he covets it.

122
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:34,924
But as he covets, so does he fear another will discover it first.

123
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:40,570
That would be unbearable to one so proud as the Archmage.

124
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:43,740
What does that have to do with me?

125
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:48,335
Because it is you who have been chosen...

126
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:51,005
...to gain the secret of eternal life.

127
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:54,320
That's why Sparrowhawk follows you.

128
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,601
To kill you.

129
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,779
To bring me death...

130
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:02,516
Arren, will you come with me?

131
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:04,685
I've already found it.

132
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:08,424
I found the door between life and death.

133
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:12,164
Together we can open that door.

134
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,870
And together, we will live forever.

135
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:18,533
We will conquer every form of fear and suffering.

136
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:21,176
Fear and suffering...

137
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:24,737
Come with me, Arren.

138
00:14:24,757 --> 00:14:26,671
The face of death is terrible!

139
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:33,184
I don't want to die.

140
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,527
Listen to me, Arren.

141
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:37,507
Tell me your True Name.

142
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:41,189
Then you will have that which you most desire.

143
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:48,230
Come, give me your True Name.

144
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:54,203
Lebannen...

145
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:04,281
Now I'm ready for you, Sparrowhawk.

146
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:15,925
Where are you, Hawk?

147
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,801
Hawk!

148
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:58,038
What's wrong, Therru?

149
00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:01,843
They came and took Tenar away!

150
00:16:02,146 --> 00:16:04,808
You have to go to Cob's castle!

151
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:06,109
Where is Arren?

152
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,870
He left!

153
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,100
He said it would come again if he didn't go!

154
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:13,623
Cob...

155
00:16:14,258 --> 00:16:16,123
Don't worry, Therru.

156
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:19,581
I'm going to help Tenar.

157
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:21,611
Wait for my return.

158
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:24,538
Keep this sword.

159
00:16:24,558 --> 00:16:26,620
Arren will need it.

160
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:36,311
Stay home, Therru!

161
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:52,151
Here-we-are!

162
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:57,700
Come on!

163
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,396
I'm not going anywhere!

164
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:05,766
Lord Cob.

165
00:17:06,386 --> 00:17:08,231
We brought the woman.

166
00:17:08,251 --> 00:17:10,096
Just as you ordered.

167
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:14,041
You've done well, Hare.

168
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:16,940
It was nothing, my lord.

169
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,506
My pleasure is to serve you.

170
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:20,983
Stand aside!

171
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:22,856
Why, you!

172
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,659
Are you the boss?

173
00:17:25,105 --> 00:17:26,883
Why did you kidnap me?

174
00:17:26,903 --> 00:17:28,681
Let me go right now!

175
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,268
So sorry for the rough treatment.

176
00:17:32,536 --> 00:17:34,663
I have business with Sparrowhawk.

177
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:37,509
You're a wizard, aren't you!

178
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:40,023
You should be ashamed!

179
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:42,438
Go find him yourself!

180
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:45,710
He's an old friend of mine.

181
00:17:45,883 --> 00:17:48,943
I'd like to invite him here.

182
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,508
And I'm the bait!

183
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,306
You're going to hurt him!

184
00:17:53,757 --> 00:17:56,726
Women tax my patience.

185
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:59,161
Put her in the dungeon.

186
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,425
Do it!

187
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:03,833
Answer me!

188
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:07,966
If something happens to Sparrowhawk, so help me!

189
00:18:09,816 --> 00:18:10,575
- Arren...

190
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:11,354
- This way!

191
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:23,891
Come, Lebannen.

192
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:26,007
I have something special for you.

193
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:54,815
Get in there!

194
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,533
Make yourself at home.

195
00:19:05,553 --> 00:19:07,683
You'll see your wizard soon enough.

196
00:19:24,614 --> 00:19:28,846
This place reminds me of the Tombs.

197
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:32,354
Sparrowhawk...

198
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:45,955
Cob!

199
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:47,719
Are you making the same mistake again?

200
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:56,871
At ease!

201
00:19:57,714 --> 00:19:58,942
Any sign of the wizard?

202
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:00,983
Not yet, sir.

203
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:05,248
Where is that confounded wizard?

204
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:09,257
Let's see...

205
00:20:13,273 --> 00:20:14,783
There he is!

206
00:20:14,803 --> 00:20:16,313
Take your positions!

207
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:25,905
Here he comes!

208
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:32,888
Don't let him escape!

209
00:20:32,908 --> 00:20:34,071
Now!

210
00:20:38,432 --> 00:20:39,344
Hear me!

211
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,276
Open the path!

212
00:20:44,805 --> 00:20:45,331
Stop!

213
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:45,877
Wait!

214
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:49,061
He tricked us!

215
00:20:49,176 --> 00:20:50,271
Well?

216
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,386
Don't just stand there!

217
00:20:58,051 --> 00:20:59,241
Cob!

218
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:00,451
It's Sparrowhawk.

219
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:01,661
I'm here!

220
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:03,507
Show yourself!

221
00:21:07,484 --> 00:21:10,817
It's been a long time, Sparrowhawk.

222
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:13,312
I've been waiting.

223
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,515
Cob of Havnor!

224
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:16,983
I left you at the border...

225
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,923
...of the land of death.

226
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:22,757
I hear you're the Archmage now.

227
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,694
Congratulations.

228
00:21:25,345 --> 00:21:27,225
I'm here, Cob.

229
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,125
Now release Tenar!

230
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:32,737
You're pitiful, Sparrowhawk.

231
00:21:32,843 --> 00:21:37,177
The great Archmage, smitten by a woman.

232
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:39,352
You used her to lure me here.

233
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:41,167
What do you want?

234
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:43,547
What do you think?

235
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:46,019
I haven't forgotten how you dragged me...

236
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:48,785
...to the gates of the Dry Land.

237
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:51,525
But you've forgotten why!

238
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:54,392
You used the Pelnish Lore...

239
00:21:54,498 --> 00:21:57,934
...to toy with the spirits of the living and the dead.

240
00:21:58,034 --> 00:22:00,059
Isn't that enough to repent?

241
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:04,902
You taught me a splendid lesson there at death's door.

242
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:08,143
Now I know I can never accept extinction.

243
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:12,779
So I gathered every ancient lore book I could find.

244
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:17,019
Alas, some of their owners were not cooperative.

245
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:21,521
What evil are you planning, Cob?

246
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,992
I've done it, Sparrowhawk!

247
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:28,223
I've woven the greatest spell of all.

248
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:31,830
The door between life and death has been closed...

249
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:33,723
...since the beginning of time.

250
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:35,521
But I will open it!

251
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:37,712
That is forbidden!

252
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,595
Don't you understand?

253
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:43,475
Those with power must wield it with wisdom.

254
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,548
Would you destroy the Balance that sustains the world?

255
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:49,313
What nonsense!

256
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:52,479
The Balance is long gone.

257
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:56,125
You know that better than anyone.

258
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:58,554
The Balance was destroyed by Man.

259
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,783
You think you can limit Man's desire?

260
00:23:01,803 --> 00:23:04,547
It's impossible!

261
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:07,566
I will live forever.

262
00:23:07,671 --> 00:23:10,572
I will gain existence without end!

263
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:13,648
Cob!

264
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:16,299
Without the cycle of death and rebirth, there is no life!

265
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:19,280
I am above Nature!

266
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:27,944
Sparrowhawk!

267
00:23:27,964 --> 00:23:29,809
There's someone else who wants to meet you.

268
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:40,205
Arren!

269
00:23:40,225 --> 00:23:41,451
What are you doing here?

270
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:43,825
Lebannen!

271
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:46,089
This man would deprive you of eternal life!

272
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,588
Arren!

273
00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:55,936
Did you reveal your True Name?

274
00:23:58,154 --> 00:24:01,590
I'm going to live forever!

275
00:24:04,904 --> 00:24:06,733
I'm tired, Sparrowhawk.

276
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:08,582
Tired of living in fear.

277
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:10,688
Arren!

278
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,321
Life without death is not life!

279
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:16,602
Refuse death, and you refuse life as well!

280
00:24:17,807 --> 00:24:19,536
Don't lie to me!

281
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:40,496
Listen to me, Arren.

282
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,828
No man nor any thing in this world lives forever.

283
00:24:46,002 --> 00:24:49,563
But only to us is it given to know that we must die.

284
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:54,076
And that is a precious gift.

285
00:24:55,145 --> 00:25:00,447
This life that is our torment and our treasure does not endure.

286
00:25:00,884 --> 00:25:02,875
It is a wave on the sea.

287
00:25:02,986 --> 00:25:07,116
Would you force the sea to grow still, to save one wave?

288
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,349
To save yourself?

289
00:25:20,303 --> 00:25:21,497
Arren...

290
00:25:31,981 --> 00:25:34,381
Thought you made a fool of me?

291
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:38,049
There's more than one entrance to this castle!

292
00:25:38,898 --> 00:25:40,442
What's happening?

293
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:42,006
I'm getting weak.

294
00:25:43,226 --> 00:25:47,492
Coming here was another of your blunders, Sparrowhawk.

295
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:50,394
Your powers are useless in this place.

296
00:25:50,744 --> 00:25:52,692
Hare!

297
00:25:52,712 --> 00:25:54,660
Put him in the dungeon with the woman.

298
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,669
I'll finish them tomorrow...

299
00:25:57,173 --> 00:26:00,370
...in the most painful and humiliating way.

300
00:26:01,077 --> 00:26:02,271
Yes, my lord.

301
00:26:02,512 --> 00:26:04,946
On your feet, chickenhawk!

302
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:29,335
Sparrowhawk!

303
00:26:29,783 --> 00:26:30,995
Sparrowhawk!

304
00:26:31,015 --> 00:26:32,227
Are you all right?

305
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:33,459
Sparrowhawk!

306
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,538
It'll all be over tomorrow.

307
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:39,046
Say your goodbyes while you still have time!

308
00:26:49,936 --> 00:26:51,013
Sparrowhawk!

309
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:52,110
Sparrowhawk!

310
00:26:52,996 --> 00:26:54,327
Tenar...

311
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:56,286
How did they do this?

312
00:26:56,306 --> 00:26:58,151
You're the Archmage!

313
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:00,923
I'm sorry, Tenar.

314
00:27:00,943 --> 00:27:02,788
I keep getting you into trouble.

315
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,337
Stop talking nonsense!

316
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,424
Which way should I go?

317
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:32,160
Arren?

318
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:38,945
Arren!

319
00:27:38,965 --> 00:27:39,559
Wait!

320
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,830
Arren!

321
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,060
Cob's men came and took Tenar away!

322
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:56,751
I have your sword!

323
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,023
Sparrowhawk said to give it to you!

324
00:28:07,303 --> 00:28:08,861
Follow you?

325
00:28:49,078 --> 00:28:52,445
Tenar is a prisoner here.

326
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:53,846
Sparrowhawk too.

327
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:56,308
Even Sparrowhawk.

328
00:28:56,729 --> 00:28:58,643
This is yours, isn't it?

329
00:28:58,663 --> 00:29:00,577
Sparrowhawk brought it for you.

330
00:29:02,035 --> 00:29:03,545
We've got to hurry.

331
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:05,075
They need our help!

332
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:08,583
I can go no further.

333
00:29:08,603 --> 00:29:10,613
You must go alone.

334
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:14,393
Bring me that sword.

335
00:29:15,204 --> 00:29:16,831
I know you can do it.

336
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:19,680
What do you mean?

337
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,329
You're right here.

338
00:29:22,078 --> 00:29:24,069
I'm not here.

339
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:27,846
Cob is holding me against my will.

340
00:29:28,384 --> 00:29:30,443
Then who are you?

341
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:31,990
Stay away!

342
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,036
Get back!

343
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:35,619
Don't come closer!

344
00:29:41,764 --> 00:29:44,528
Arren's heart was always full of fear.

345
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:48,634
The fear filled his heart with darkness.

346
00:29:50,006 --> 00:29:51,633
Fear of what?

347
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:56,176
The darkness stole his body and ran away with it.

348
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:59,379
But it left something important behind.

349
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:09,348
Wherever there is darkness, there also you will find light.

350
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:11,893
Now the light that was left behind...

351
00:30:12,328 --> 00:30:14,523
...wanders alone, like a shadow.

352
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:16,458
A shadow?

353
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:23,397
What you see now is just a shadow chasing its body.

354
00:30:30,947 --> 00:30:32,039
Father...

355
00:30:34,684 --> 00:30:36,675
You are Arren, aren't you?

356
00:30:38,865 --> 00:30:40,528
Don't worry.

357
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,211
I'll be with you.

358
00:30:43,993 --> 00:30:45,824
I'll give you my True Name.

359
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:48,968
My True Name is Lebannen...

360
00:30:48,988 --> 00:30:51,317
Lebannen.

361
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,569
Lebannen...

362
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:09,439
It's him.

363
00:32:13,082 --> 00:32:16,108
He should be ashamed to call himself Archmage!

364
00:32:16,219 --> 00:32:19,518
Remember who he was up against.

365
00:32:19,622 --> 00:32:21,817
No wizard in Earthsea is a match for Lord Cob!

366
00:32:21,924 --> 00:32:23,414
Well spoken!

367
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:28,860
By the way, what's our little friend up to?

368
00:32:28,965 --> 00:32:31,456
He shut himself in his room.

369
00:32:32,468 --> 00:32:34,459
Arren's really here!

370
00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:37,531
He's a lucky one, that boy.

371
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,407
It's just like Lord Cob to steal the wizard's apprentice.

372
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:45,481
He's not much use though, is he?

373
00:32:45,982 --> 00:32:47,279
None at all.

374
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:51,217
When we're through with the wizard, we'll sell the boy!

375
00:33:00,773 --> 00:33:02,221
All right!

376
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:03,689
Go get Sparrowhawk and his woman.

377
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,702
The Archmage's time has finally run out!

378
00:33:09,772 --> 00:33:11,706
They're going to kill them.

379
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:28,885
Arren!

380
00:34:30,553 --> 00:34:31,713
Arren?

381
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,029
What are you doing here?

382
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:37,878
Did they kidnap you too?

383
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:47,989
Here.

384
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:49,286
This belongs to you.

385
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:52,974
I'm not worthy to hold my father's sword.

386
00:34:54,644 --> 00:34:57,442
Arren, they've got Tenar and Sparrowhawk.

387
00:34:57,546 --> 00:34:59,241
They're going to kill them.

388
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:00,834
Please!

389
00:35:00,854 --> 00:35:02,330
Help them like you helped me!

390
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:05,053
I can't help anyone.

391
00:35:05,221 --> 00:35:08,315
All I can do is fail.

392
00:35:08,424 --> 00:35:10,392
What's wrong with you?

393
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:13,257
They'll die if we don't do something!

394
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:19,423
They'll die!

395
00:35:19,443 --> 00:35:21,123
We'll lose both of them!

396
00:35:30,413 --> 00:35:34,008
We'll lose the most important thing in the world.

397
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:39,282
Therru?

398
00:35:42,591 --> 00:35:45,116
What's the most important thing?

399
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,128
Life is the most important thing!

400
00:35:52,211 --> 00:35:54,506
We'll all die someday.

401
00:35:54,526 --> 00:35:56,821
What does it matter?

402
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,945
Why fight for life?

403
00:35:59,965 --> 00:36:02,494
We know it's going to end anyway.

404
00:36:02,822 --> 00:36:04,685
No!

405
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:06,568
Life is precious because we know we're going to die!

406
00:36:06,692 --> 00:36:08,953
You're not afraid of death.

407
00:36:08,973 --> 00:36:11,234
You're afraid of life!

408
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:14,588
You want to live forever, then you say nothing matters.

409
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,851
It's the same thing!

410
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:19,985
You're afraid to live the only life you have!

411
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:22,260
Therru...

412
00:36:22,565 --> 00:36:24,897
You think your life belongs to you?

413
00:36:28,147 --> 00:36:29,827
Tenar gave me life.

414
00:36:29,847 --> 00:36:31,527
That's why I have to live...

415
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,666
...to give life to someone else.

416
00:36:38,414 --> 00:36:39,847
Lebannen...

417
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:44,177
That's the only way we live forever.

418
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:02,097
Therru... how did you know my True Name?

419
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:04,573
You told me yourself.

420
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:09,733
Now I'll tell you mine.

421
00:37:09,753 --> 00:37:11,900
My True Name is...

422
00:37:12,081 --> 00:37:15,050
Tehanu... it's Tehanu.

423
00:37:15,951 --> 00:37:17,543
Tehanu...

424
00:37:40,643 --> 00:37:42,543
It'll be dawn soon.

425
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:44,582
Come on, Therru.

426
00:37:44,602 --> 00:37:46,095
We've got to help them!

427
00:37:56,258 --> 00:37:57,156
Arren, wait!

428
00:37:58,194 --> 00:37:59,024
What is it?

429
00:37:59,128 --> 00:38:00,095
There!

430
00:38:05,734 --> 00:38:07,668
It's Sparrowhawk and Tenar!

431
00:38:08,504 --> 00:38:09,596
Come on!

432
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:15,101
Jump!

433
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:16,697
I can't!

434
00:38:16,717 --> 00:38:17,693
It's too far!

435
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:18,735
Don't worry!

436
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:19,667
You can do it!

437
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:27,982
Let's go!

438
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,215
Sparrowhawk!

439
00:38:58,154 --> 00:39:01,146
Time to say goodbye, Sparrowhawk.

440
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,955
Your lover is going on a journey.

441
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,551
Why don't you send him off yourself?

442
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:16,602
Don't worry, Sparrowhawk.

443
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:19,706
This world will be in good hands after you're gone.

444
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:24,039
What can I do, Sparrowhawk?

445
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,710
Tenar.

446
00:39:26,525 --> 00:39:28,604
It's not over yet.

447
00:39:28,624 --> 00:39:30,703
The sun will rise soon.

448
00:39:32,421 --> 00:39:33,945
What do you mean?

449
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:37,761
Don't you hear it, Tenar?

450
00:39:37,781 --> 00:39:40,275
Help is almost here.

451
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:46,595
That's enough time for goodbyes.

452
00:39:46,745 --> 00:39:47,908
Do it!

453
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,091
Finish him!

454
00:39:49,205 --> 00:39:50,433
No!

455
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:55,567
Let them go!

456
00:39:56,378 --> 00:39:57,345
It's you!

457
00:39:57,456 --> 00:39:58,170
Arren!

458
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:58,904
Therru!

459
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:01,647
Stay out of this, boy!

460
00:40:02,751 --> 00:40:05,117
Don't show him any mercy!

461
00:40:05,721 --> 00:40:06,949
Get back!

462
00:40:12,261 --> 00:40:13,489
Take him!

463
00:40:25,474 --> 00:40:27,339
Please don't hurt me!

464
00:40:28,244 --> 00:40:29,939
I'm disappointed.

465
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:33,338
I thought you and I had an understanding.

466
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:35,601
Silence!

467
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:37,330
You don't control me any ore.

468
00:40:37,786 --> 00:40:42,155
Then you shall see the face of death, Lebannen!

469
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:49,830
A summoning spell!

470
00:40:55,337 --> 00:40:55,996
Arren!

471
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:57,538
Stay back!

472
00:40:59,275 --> 00:41:00,799
Now die!

473
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:22,334
Please!

474
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,682
Let me draw it.

475
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:26,330
For Life!

476
00:42:03,972 --> 00:42:07,408
That sword was forged with magic!

477
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:32,827
He's an old man!

478
00:42:33,435 --> 00:42:35,630
Disguised by sorcery.

479
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:37,896
Lord Cob!

480
00:42:40,909 --> 00:42:42,968
You can't stop me.

481
00:42:43,345 --> 00:42:46,143
I will never accept death.

482
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,275
Wizards shouldn't fear death!

483
00:42:50,886 --> 00:42:52,786
You wretched girl!

484
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:55,416
I'm not like you!

485
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:56,896
I'm better than you.

486
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:58,278
Insignificant worms!

487
00:42:58,894 --> 00:43:01,294
I studied the wisdom of the ages!

488
00:43:01,407 --> 00:43:03,151
I wield power!

489
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:04,915
I am almighty!

490
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:11,263
Scorned as a fool by the wizards of Roke.

491
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,465
Driven out like a dog!

492
00:43:15,454 --> 00:43:17,516
But I'll have my revenge.

493
00:43:17,536 --> 00:43:19,598
I will never die.

494
00:43:19,715 --> 00:43:22,980
I'll be the supreme Archmage!

495
00:43:38,267 --> 00:43:39,325
Therru!

496
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,424
Therru!

497
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,078
That little fool!

498
00:44:24,189 --> 00:44:26,518
Hear me, stones.

499
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,867
I unbind you!

500
00:45:19,434 --> 00:45:21,527
Sunrise...

501
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,734
Let me go!

502
00:45:30,178 --> 00:45:31,475
Does it hurt, girl?

503
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,706
Cob!

504
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,910
Let her go!

505
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:38,114
Stay back!

506
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,553
Death is terrifying!

507
00:45:42,457 --> 00:45:43,481
Don't do it!

508
00:45:47,095 --> 00:45:50,155
So terrifying.

509
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:55,734
Wait!

510
00:46:18,994 --> 00:46:23,124
So terrifying... very terrifying...

511
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:25,188
Cob!

512
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:26,787
You're just like me.

513
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:30,696
You turn away from light and see only darkness!

514
00:46:32,684 --> 00:46:33,631
No!

515
00:46:33,651 --> 00:46:34,598
Keep away!

516
00:46:36,945 --> 00:46:39,709
You forgot that all life is connected.

517
00:46:39,815 --> 00:46:42,807
Life can't be hoarded, it can only be given!

518
00:46:43,485 --> 00:46:46,648
Deny death, and you deny life!

519
00:46:47,165 --> 00:46:48,425
No!

520
00:46:48,445 --> 00:46:49,705
You're wrong!

521
00:46:51,036 --> 00:46:52,916
Face the truth, Cob!

522
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:54,816
Everyone fears death!

523
00:46:56,341 --> 00:46:58,505
No!

524
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:00,689
I don't want to die.

525
00:47:01,937 --> 00:47:02,835
Cob!

526
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:05,165
No!

527
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:07,470
Therru!

528
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:19,625
Therru...

529
00:47:19,645 --> 00:47:20,740
Arren...

530
00:47:30,232 --> 00:47:31,460
Arren!

531
00:47:41,753 --> 00:47:42,995
Time to die!

532
00:47:43,015 --> 00:47:44,257
Time to die!

533
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:45,607
Arren!

534
00:47:46,415 --> 00:47:48,975
And you will join him.

535
00:47:55,133 --> 00:47:56,444
Let her go!

536
00:47:56,464 --> 00:47:57,775
Don't kill her!

537
00:48:00,595 --> 00:48:04,588
All who oppose me must die!

538
00:48:34,372 --> 00:48:36,252
She's dead, she's dead.

539
00:48:36,272 --> 00:48:38,152
Poor thing.

540
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,137
Sun is rising.

541
00:48:55,117 --> 00:48:58,143
Hurry... must hurry...

542
00:48:58,253 --> 00:48:59,743
Stop!

543
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:38,355
Therru!

544
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:49,834
Eternal life!

545
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:57,335
Shadow, return to darkness!

546
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:01,246
Give me life!

547
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:10,253
I want life... life!

548
00:50:17,299 --> 00:50:18,766
Life!

549
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:27,268
I want to live!

550
00:50:57,572 --> 00:51:00,507
Tehanu!

551
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:45,845
So you're safe too.

552
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:52,459
What about them?

553
00:51:53,438 --> 00:51:55,432
They'll be fine.

554
00:51:55,452 --> 00:51:57,446
They have wings.

555
00:53:20,925 --> 00:53:22,105
Thank you...

556
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:23,305
Therru.

557
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:32,783
I'm going back to pay for my crime.

558
00:53:33,762 --> 00:53:36,196
And to face myself.

559
00:53:38,366 --> 00:53:39,492
Arren.

560
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:45,166
Can I come to see you again someday?

561
00:53:50,945 --> 00:53:51,934
Come on.

562
00:53:52,247 --> 00:53:55,739
We have to thank Sparrowhawk and Tenar.
