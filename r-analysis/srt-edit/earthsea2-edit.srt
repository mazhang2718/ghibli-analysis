1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:25,067
Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DYMP, Walt Disney Japan, Mitsubishi and Toho Present Only in silence the word, only in dark the light, only in dying life: bright the hawk's flight! on the empty sky.

2
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:47,598
- The Creation of Éa Ease the Sail!

3
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,390
It's blowing too hard!

4
00:00:54,106 --> 00:00:55,546
Curse it!

5
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:57,006
A storm this time of year?

6
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:58,466
Where's my Weatherworker?

7
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:01,532
What are you waiting for?

8
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:04,098
Calm the waves before we sink!

9
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,151
What's wrong?

10
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,205
Captain...

11
00:01:09,225 --> 00:01:11,270
I can't remember them.

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,534
I can't remember the True Names of wind and waves.

13
00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:17,217
What?

14
00:01:17,237 --> 00:01:18,326
Are you mad?

15
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,750
Captain!

16
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,044
There's something above the clouds!

17
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:25,920
Where?

18
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,468
What is that?

19
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:54,626
A dragon!

20
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:56,316
What is it doing here?

21
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,168
There's another one!

22
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:31,542
Dragons fighting?

23
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:33,027
That's impossible!

24
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:04,064
More than 2,000 sheep have taken the fever in Enlad alone.

25
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,070
Half of them have died.

26
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,777
Seven hundred cattle have been infected.

27
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,071
We've lost 50 head so far.

28
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:17,908
In fact, a baby on Taon has also come down with the fever.

29
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,501
Silence!

30
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,082
If we panic, what will become of the People?

31
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,299
Seal off the affected areas.

32
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,592
Send every healer in the kingdom to find a cure.

33
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,008
Send provisions to those who need them.

34
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:37,874
Wizard Root!

35
00:03:37,894 --> 00:03:39,751
Find out what's behind this.

36
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,597
Your Majesty.

37
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,524
And the drought in the provinces?

38
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,070
We sent Weatherworkers but the results were disappointing.

39
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:57,078
Soon it may be too late for the spring planting.

40
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,584
Why have these misfortunes befallen us, Root?

41
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,749
I sense the Light dimming, Your Majesty.

42
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,292
The Light?

43
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:10,009
The Light of the Balance that sustains the world.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,377
Your Majesty!

45
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,844
What now?

46
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,509
Terrible news!

47
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,758
Dragons have been sighted off the coast!

48
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:19,041
- Dragons?

49
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:20,334
- Two, Majesty.

50
00:04:20,354 --> 00:04:21,627
One was killed.

51
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:25,028
Dragons here, in the East?

52
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:27,804
Can this really be true?

53
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,485
Long ago, dragons and men were one.

54
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:37,654
But men who coveted possessions chose the land and the sea.

55
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,577
Dragons who wanted freedom, chose wind and fire.

56
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,953
Since then, dragons and men remained apart.

57
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:50,253
To hear that dragons have been seen, and were even fighting...

58
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:54,504
The twilight that threatens us is ever deepening.

59
00:04:58,141 --> 00:05:00,248
Bring the captain to me.

60
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:02,375
I would hear more of this.

61
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,643
Root, I want you there too.

62
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:10,721
Please...

63
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:11,517
Your Majesty!

64
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,619
- We'll get in trouble!

65
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,728
- I have to!

66
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,455
- What is it?

67
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:17,190
- Have you seen Prince Arren?

68
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,662
He's been gone since last night.

69
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:21,395
Prince Arren?

70
00:05:21,415 --> 00:05:22,146
Gone?

71
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,498
That's enough.

72
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,042
His Majesty is occupied.

73
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,589
Surely you can see that.

74
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,087
Forgive me.

75
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:38,829
It's just... he seems so sad lately.

76
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:40,581
We were worried.

77
00:05:41,017 --> 00:05:43,296
That's absurd!

78
00:05:43,316 --> 00:05:45,595
Arren is 17, not a child.

79
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,399
Forgive this disturbance, Your Majesty.

80
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,440
Your people are more important.

81
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:54,073
- Very well, then.

82
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:55,137
- Your Majesty.

83
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,486
I must tend to my correspondence.

84
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,908
We await your command, sire.

85
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,923
I'm imagining things.

86
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,122
Arren!

87
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,927
So you are my death...

88
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,228
Are you hurt?

89
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,990
Steady there, lad!

90
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,357
Ls this what you seek?

91
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,531
This is dangerous country for travelers.

92
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:50,411
You were lucky this time.

93
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:52,351
You must be hungry.

94
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,365
It's not much, but you're welcome to it.

95
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,621
What is your name, lad?

96
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,168
My name is Arren.

97
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:10,578
Arren, is it?

98
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:12,540
It means sword, doesn't it?

99
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,390
So you hail from Enlad.

100
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,559
How did you know?

101
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,397
That blade was forged with magic.

102
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,398
I doubt you could unsheathe it.

103
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,078
What is it?

104
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,746
It's nothing.

105
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,429
Arren?

106
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,601
If you have nowhere to go, why not come with me?

107
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,398
I doubt our meeting here was an accident.

108
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,447
And I'd welcome a companion on the road.

109
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:17,875
Arren!

110
00:12:17,895 --> 00:12:18,774
Are you coming?

111
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,793
What should I call you?

112
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,293
Call me Sparrowhawk.

113
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:37,598
Another abandoned farm.

114
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:39,725
Farmers leaving their land...

115
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,865
There's more to this than poor harvests.

116
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:45,359
Come, Arren.

117
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:46,696
We'd better push on.

118
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,169
Lord Sparrowhawk?

119
00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:53,327
Sparrowhawk will do.

120
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:54,499
What is it?

121
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,803
Sparrowhawk?

122
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,013
Where are we heading?

123
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,810
First, we go to the next town.

124
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,000
But after that...

125
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,347
...even I don't know.

126
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:25,190
- Getting tired?

127
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,402
- No.

128
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:27,398
Come along.

129
00:14:27,418 --> 00:14:28,399
We're almost there.

130
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,436
There it is.

131
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,232
Hort Town.

132
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,805
Are they prisoners?

133
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,553
They are slaves.

134
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,302
Here, people are goods to buy and sell.

135
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,687
Trading in human lives!

136
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:13,673
Two guineas, gentlemen!

137
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:15,135
Do I hear two guineas?

138
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,859
I have two guineas!

139
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,929
Three!

140
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:21,017
Sold to the gentleman for three guineas!

141
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,460
No, sorry!

142
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,150
Couldn't possibly find room!

143
00:16:50,728 --> 00:16:52,460
Gauzes from Sowl!

144
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,212
Silks from Lorbanery!

145
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,566
Furs and felts and woolens!

146
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,856
Ls this a market day?

147
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,071
No. it's like this year round.

148
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:03,930
Silks and satins!

149
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,557
Canvass and fleecefells!

150
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,786
What can I show you?

151
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,078
This is Lorbanery's finest silk!

152
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,542
Fine as a mayfly's wing!

153
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:17,277
I don't have a wife.

154
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:19,530
I need a cloak for my friend.

155
00:17:19,757 --> 00:17:21,159
Wizards!

156
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,581
No girlfriend, eh?

157
00:17:22,593 --> 00:17:25,599
- But I don't need a cloak.

158
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,625
- You can't go about like that.

159
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,801
You should hide that thing on your belt.

160
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,098
What about this?

161
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:34,798
Fleece from Gont.

162
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:36,220
Highest quality.

163
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,215
Four warp strings.

164
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:41,217
This is Andradean work.

165
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,481
On Gont they use six or more.

166
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,978
You used to be a sorceress.

167
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:50,026
Why are you selling fakes?

168
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,994
People don't believe in foolish tricks any more.

169
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,997
My goods are not what I claim.

170
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,296
But at least they're real...

171
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,043
...not mere lies and air like magic and sorcery!

172
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,131
Sparrowhawk!

173
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,303
Thank you!

174
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,552
What!

175
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,471
Unhand me!

176
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,842
Calm yourself, young master.

177
00:18:55,551 --> 00:19:01,058
I have something for you. it's the door to bliss.

178
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,525
What is it?

179
00:19:02,818 --> 00:19:04,448
Hazia, my lord.

180
00:19:04,468 --> 00:19:06,098
Ha-zi-a.

181
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:07,305
Take one.

182
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:08,517
Leave sorrow and fear behind.

183
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,984
No more sorrow or fear...

184
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:16,535
You'll never be troubled with the pain of this world again.

185
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,331
You needn't pay me. it's my pleasure.

186
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,330
Arren.

187
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,792
What are you doing?

188
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,544
Ls this your friend, my lord?

189
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:33,250
And what about you?

190
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,549
Don't wizards have troubles too?

191
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,042
I'm sorry.

192
00:19:38,062 --> 00:19:40,044
I have no use for what you're selling.

193
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,685
Save us from the arrogance of sorcerers!

194
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,237
I suppose you've lost your powers too!

195
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:52,540
Hazia is not something to toy with, Arren.

196
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,776
Look!

197
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:59,207
The hazia eater feels himself in paradise.

198
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:04,375
Then the spirit leaves the body and wanders aimlessly in darkness.

199
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,502
When it returns?

200
00:20:06,522 --> 00:20:08,019
More hazia.

201
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,536
And finally, death.

202
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,798
What's the matter?

203
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,566
Feeling better?

204
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,739
The wind is fresh up here.

205
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,903
Something's wrong with this town.

206
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,452
Not only this town, lad.

207
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,318
Farmers' crops wither.

208
00:20:43,338 --> 00:20:45,656
Their sheep and cattle are falling sick.

209
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,790
Even people's minds have lost their way.

210
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,293
Is it some sort of pestilence?

211
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,911
No.

212
00:20:54,931 --> 00:20:57,289
A pestilence is how the Balance restores itself.

213
00:20:57,516 --> 00:20:59,396
But this?

214
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,296
I fear someone is trying to destroy the Balance.

215
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:06,149
There's only one creature in Earthsea capable of such evil.

216
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,770
Only one.

217
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:13,016
Well then.

218
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:14,814
Shall we go back to the inn?

219
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,159
I'd like to rest a little longer.

220
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,823
Very well.

221
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:22,025
I'll be waiting.

222
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:23,322
Keep your wits about you.

223
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,250
I will.

224
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,866
Slave takers?

225
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,851
A witch, are you?

226
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,062
And an ugly one at that!

227
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,610
Won't fetch much with that face.

228
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,722
Just a few guineas.

229
00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:19,935
But we can still have a little fun.

230
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:22,120
Oww!

231
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,059
My finger!

232
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,329
The witch has spirit!

233
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,324
I'm going to enjoy this.

234
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,450
Who's there?

235
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,245
Step forward and show yourself!

236
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,135
Well, well.

237
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,760
What are you doing here, boy?

238
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:44,560
Go ahead.

239
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,374
Take him!

240
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,151
No hard feelings, boy.

241
00:23:50,171 --> 00:23:52,302
Just following the boss's orders.

242
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,809
I'll make it quick.

243
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,356
Or maybe you'd like to be a slave?

244
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,150
Beg for your life!

245
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,369
Changed your mind?

246
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,626
Life is nothing to me.

247
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,339
So you want a fight, eh?

248
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,463
Draw your sword!

249
00:24:33,023 --> 00:24:34,465
All right.

250
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:35,927
Now it's my turn.

251
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,539
Uh oh.

252
00:24:58,757 --> 00:25:00,723
Hold on there son.

253
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:02,709
You don't care about the girl?

254
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,047
DO it.

255
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,387
If you want her so much, here she is!

256
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:16,467
Come on men!

257
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:17,639
Let's go!

258
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,365
Are you...

259
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,037
Therru!

260
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,203
Therru!

261
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,422
Therru...

262
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,666
A bird...

263
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:17,273
So!

264
00:27:17,293 --> 00:27:18,797
We meet again, boy.

265
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,518
Take him!

266
00:27:27,197 --> 00:27:28,929
He'll fetch a good price.

267
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:30,681
Don't be too rough.

268
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,330
Take him away!

269
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:42,718
Just an old piece of junk.

270
00:27:42,738 --> 00:27:44,829
Couldn't give it away!

271
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,592
Give it up, it's no use.

272
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:31,551
Quiet!

273
00:28:32,012 --> 00:28:33,602
Silence!

274
00:28:33,622 --> 00:28:35,212
Or I'll feed you to the hounds!

275
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:05,870
Come on!

276
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,792
Get moving!

277
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,378
What's going on?

278
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:12,162
I don't know.

279
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:13,960
Move, you lazy animals!

280
00:29:13,971 --> 00:29:15,185
Confound it!

281
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:16,419
What's wrong?

282
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,458
Sparrowhawk...

283
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,462
Let's go, Arren.

284
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,973
Can YOU stand?

285
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,562
What about the others?

286
00:30:13,572 --> 00:30:15,429
I left none bound.

287
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:17,306
Now it's up to them.

288
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,381
How did you know where to find me?

289
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:42,178
When you didn't come, I scoured Hort Town.

290
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:46,853
Finally, someone told me a young man was taken by slavers.

291
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:51,192
I had to make a spell of finding.

292
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,855
I am sorry, I was foolish.

293
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,074
No, it was my fault.

294
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,785
I should've been more careful.

295
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,909
I'm sorry.

296
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:09,386
Who's there?

297
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,809
It's me, Sparrowhawk.

298
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,307
Sparrowhawk?

299
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,149
Someone's been hurt.

300
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:23,957
I'm sorry.

301
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:24,816
It's late.

302
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,826
It's been a long time, Ged.

303
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,251
He's asleep.

304
00:32:42,554 --> 00:32:44,520
I'm sorry.

305
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,506
I'm afraid you've lost your bed.

306
00:32:46,892 --> 00:32:48,420
It's his now.

307
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,968
Here, this will warm you.

308
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,015
Thanks.

309
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,693
You haven't changed.

310
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:04,056
No.

311
00:33:04,076 --> 00:33:05,808
You're keeping well, Tenar?

312
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:08,064
I suppose.

313
00:33:08,084 --> 00:33:09,862
It hasn't always been easy.

314
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:10,830
And you?

315
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,116
Do you still wander?

316
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,334
That was good.

317
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,837
It has been a long time.

318
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,046
Yes, it has.

319
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,840
As Archmage, I have no time...

320
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,721
...to wander as I once did.

321
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:31,052
And what brings the Archmage so far from home?

322
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,849
Evil tidings come from every corner of Earthsea.

323
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,351
Things are out of balance...

324
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:44,068
...as if the sun's light were ebbing.

325
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:48,073
Ls the Art Magic ebbing too?

326
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:51,312
Yes.

327
00:33:51,332 --> 00:33:53,565
As if our very blood were flowing from our veins.

328
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,326
So you Search for the answer?

329
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,498
YES.

330
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,336
Oh dear, we woke you up.

331
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:06,994
Come, child.

332
00:34:07,014 --> 00:34:08,663
Don't worry.

333
00:34:08,683 --> 00:34:10,332
This man is an old friend of mine.

334
00:34:14,854 --> 00:34:16,671
This is Therru.

335
00:34:16,691 --> 00:34:18,508
She's been with me five years.

336
00:34:20,652 --> 00:34:22,469
Call me Sparrowhawk.

337
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:24,306
I'm sorry I woke you.

338
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:28,616
Hawk?

339
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,836
Well, you should be honored.

340
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:38,402
Therru never speaks to strangers.

341
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:39,919
What is it?

342
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,925
Could she really be...?

343
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,104
Lord Cob.

344
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,275
Enter.

345
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,914
Forgive my intrusion.

346
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:56,729
I beg leave to speak.

347
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:58,866
What is it?

348
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,869
I'm afraid some of our slaves escaped.

349
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,636
I see.

350
00:36:04,656 --> 00:36:06,872
You let my precious merchandise go.

351
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,888
No.

352
00:36:08,908 --> 00:36:10,663
We've captured most of them.

353
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,841
And?

354
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,886
What about the others?

355
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:18,106
We're scouring the countryside.

356
00:36:18,126 --> 00:36:19,881
We'll find them.

357
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,020
You're a fool.

358
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,940
Do you think I can't manage without you?

359
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:35,059
It was a wizard!

360
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:37,437
A wizard with a scar on his face!

361
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,163
What?

362
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,454
A scar on his face?

363
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:46,342
It's Sparrowhawk.

364
00:36:46,362 --> 00:36:48,367
The Archmage pays me a visit.

365
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:52,382
Find him for me, Hare... or else.

366
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,880
I won't fail you, my lord.

367
00:37:01,104 --> 00:37:03,149
I've waited long for this day...

368
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:05,214
Sparrowhawk.

369
00:37:40,894 --> 00:37:42,398
Tenar!

370
00:37:42,418 --> 00:37:43,922
I brought the water in!

371
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,597
Where is she?

372
00:37:46,065 --> 00:37:47,172
Tenar?

373
00:37:47,192 --> 00:37:48,299
Are you still asleep?

374
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:50,818
Tenaf?

375
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,488
Are you sick?

376
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,155
Who was that?

377
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,125
It's that girl!

378
00:38:08,296 --> 00:38:09,986
That must've been a surprise.

379
00:38:10,006 --> 00:38:11,696
I'm sorry dear.

380
00:38:11,716 --> 00:38:13,406
I should've told you.

381
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:14,971
Don't worry.

382
00:38:14,991 --> 00:38:16,536
Arren is with me.

383
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,800
You have nothing to fear.

384
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,802
Sometimes his eyes are wild, but he has a good heart.

385
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:28,519
Good morning.

386
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,526
Good morning.

387
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,904
I'm done eating!

388
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,022
Well!

389
00:38:37,408 --> 00:38:38,850
Did you sleep well?

390
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,312
How do you feel?

391
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,659
I'm all right.

392
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,533
I didn't do anything to her.

393
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:48,296
Of course you didn't.

394
00:38:48,316 --> 00:38:49,736
Come have breakfast.

395
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,171
Can't work if you don't eat.

396
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,044
Work?

397
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,208
Ouch...

398
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,707
Are you getting blisters?

399
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,045
YES.

400
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,757
Shall we rest a bit?

401
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,681
What a good smell.

402
00:39:43,683 --> 00:39:44,625
- But...

403
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:45,587
- Yes, lad?

404
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,765
You're a wizard, aren't you?

405
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,354
Oh, I see.

406
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:55,444
You want to know why a wizard toils in the field like a farmer?

407
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,436
YES.

408
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,113
Listen, Arren.

409
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:03,952
Everything under the sun and stars depends on the Balance.

410
00:40:05,204 --> 00:40:07,084
The wind and seas.

411
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,984
The power of earth and light.

412
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:16,214
All that these do is well and rightly done within the Equilibrium.

413
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:21,550
But now, men hold the power to control the world.

414
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:25,011
So Man must learn to keep the Balance...

415
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:29,978
...and do what leaf and whale and wind do of their own nature.

416
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,807
You know everything has its True Name.

417
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:39,905
Magic is the power to command, if you know a thing's True Name.

418
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:45,073
Use that power in ignorance and the Balance is easily damaged.

419
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,368
Spells should be made only of necessity.

420
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,115
You've been busy.

421
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,998
I suppose you two deserve some lunch.

422
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,006
Are you feeling better, Arren?

423
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:03,757
Now eat hearty, or you won't get your strength back.

424
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,306
What about the girl?

425
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,345
Oh, Therru?

426
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,515
One of the spring lambs is sick.

427
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,013
She's nursing it today.

428
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:18,935
Shall we change places?

429
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,653
No, I can manage.

430
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,774
- How did it go?

431
00:41:33,794 --> 00:41:35,026
- That's it for today.

432
00:41:35,461 --> 00:41:37,028
Dinner will be ready soon.

433
00:41:37,048 --> 00:41:38,615
Better wash up.

434
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,600
- I'll put the ox in the stable.

435
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,210
- Thanks, lad.

436
00:41:58,276 --> 00:42:00,680
There, you should be feeling better.

437
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,104
Now you need your mother's milk.

438
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,568
That's it.

439
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,579
Good girl.

440
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,088
What do you want?

441
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,756
Oh... nothing.

442
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,713
Why did you come here?

443
00:42:28,723 --> 00:42:30,393
To hurt me?

444
00:42:30,413 --> 00:42:32,083
To kill this little one?

445
00:42:32,477 --> 00:42:33,754
You don't understand!

446
00:42:33,774 --> 00:42:35,051
I was just...

447
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,797
Stay away!

448
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:39,924
Get out of here!

449
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,945
I hate anyone who doesn't value life!

450
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:48,949
I'm sorry.

451
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,581
Step aside!

452
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,714
Let's eat.

453
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:08,883
It's so good having men to help with the farm.

454
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,096
Even you two.

455
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:15,094
I'm no good with a plow, but I do know animals.

456
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,472
You used to be a goatherd.

457
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,320
What's wrong, Arren?

458
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,760
Aren't you hungry?

459
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,567
No.

460
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,356
What is this place?

461
00:44:28,968 --> 00:44:30,325
Come, Arren.

462
00:44:30,345 --> 00:44:31,702
This way.

463
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,338
Sparrowhawk?

464
00:44:43,983 --> 00:44:45,260
Come.

465
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,557
Take my hand.

466
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,240
Arren!

467
00:44:53,242 --> 00:44:54,254
No!

468
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,286
Leave me alone!

469
00:44:55,306 --> 00:44:56,318
Stop!

470
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:01,575
Arren!

471
00:45:12,428 --> 00:45:13,660
Arren!

472
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,912
Wake up!

473
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,506
Arren!

474
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,681
What's wrong?

475
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,274
A bad dream, I think.

476
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,852
A dream...

477
00:45:38,454 --> 00:45:40,858
Spring is very short, you know.

478
00:45:40,878 --> 00:45:43,282
I need all the help I can get.

479
00:45:43,542 --> 00:45:45,649
I'm sorry, Tenar.

480
00:45:45,669 --> 00:45:47,776
I have an errand that cannot wait.

481
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,623
I still can't rely on you.

482
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,967
Come now, Tenar.

483
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,796
Should you be taking Arren's horse?

484
00:45:57,306 --> 00:45:59,624
He's better off without it.

485
00:45:59,644 --> 00:46:01,962
Tell him I borrowed it.

486
00:46:02,311 --> 00:46:04,293
Tenar.

487
00:46:04,313 --> 00:46:06,295
Keep a close eye on him for me.

488
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,308
I promise.

489
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:11,219
I'll be back tonight!

490
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:12,931
And back at work tomorrow!

491
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,527
I certainly hope so.

492
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,172
Haven't seen him around here.

493
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,344
And that scar!

494
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,972
He must've come from that woman's house.

495
00:46:43,978 --> 00:46:45,835
She's a witch.

496
00:46:45,855 --> 00:46:47,712
I don't like the looks of it.

497
00:46:47,732 --> 00:46:50,386
Yes, she's an odd one.

498
00:46:50,406 --> 00:46:53,060
And that little girl she keeps!

499
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:57,069
That child will bring bad luck on us all.

500
00:46:57,074 --> 00:46:58,619
No!

501
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:00,184
Don't say that out loud!

502
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,449
Who was that?

503
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:08,702
He's not from around here.

504
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,578
He's a friend of ours.

505
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,626
He's helping us out.

506
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,248
Ls that so?

507
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,625
Can I help you?

508
00:47:16,052 --> 00:47:18,370
My child has a fever ma'am.

509
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,708
I need that potion again.

510
00:47:20,723 --> 00:47:21,790
All right.

511
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:22,877
Just wait there.

512
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,354
Quit sticking to me!

513
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,144
I'm afraid!

514
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,606
Spare us from evil!

515
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,479
That's enough!

516
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:38,807
There.

517
00:47:38,827 --> 00:47:41,145
If the child's not better, come see me again.

518
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,994
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

519
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,034
Actually, I was wondering...

520
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:48,694
Yes, I know.

521
00:47:48,714 --> 00:47:50,242
Pay me when you can.

522
00:47:50,252 --> 00:47:51,631
Thanks ma'am.

523
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:53,030
You're very kind.

524
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,416
Hope she feels better!

525
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:01,262
I wish there were more decent people in the world.

526
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,756
Therru never hurt anyone.

527
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:09,053
Well, at least the woman looks after her own.

528
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:15,603
As for Therru, her parents abused and abandoned her.

529
00:48:16,695 --> 00:48:18,615
They burned her.

530
00:48:18,635 --> 00:48:20,555
That's how she got that scar.

531
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:03,991
What a frightful Child!

532
00:49:03,993 --> 00:49:05,287
My goodness!

533
00:49:05,307 --> 00:49:06,601
Did you see her eyes?

534
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,831
Please, have mercy!

535
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:17,626
No one will buy an old woman!

536
00:49:19,717 --> 00:49:21,699
Nothing to fear ladies.

537
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:23,701
Maybe you can even help me.

538
00:49:24,096 --> 00:49:26,249
Seen any strangers around here?

539
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:28,422
Be much obliged for any help.

540
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,681
And I'll pay.

541
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,227
There's one at Tenar's farm!

542
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,066
And one with a scar on his face!

543
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:39,261
Tenar?

544
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:40,223
Who's that?

545
00:49:40,237 --> 00:49:41,657
The witch!

546
00:49:41,677 --> 00:49:43,097
She lives right up this road.

547
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,699
Thanks for the help, old hags!

548
00:49:48,412 --> 00:49:49,626
Wait!

549
00:49:49,646 --> 00:49:50,860
Where are you going?

550
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:54,012
Stop!

551
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,336
Liar!

552
00:49:55,356 --> 00:49:56,660
You promised to pay!

553
00:50:00,508 --> 00:50:01,512
There it is!

554
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:02,536
That's it!

555
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,845
What's that?

556
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,399
What are you doing?

557
00:50:20,569 --> 00:50:22,614
You're looking fit, boy.

558
00:50:22,634 --> 00:50:24,679
Didn't think I'd find you here.

559
00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:26,663
Swine!

560
00:50:26,683 --> 00:50:27,647
What are you doing here?

561
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,324
Now, now.

562
00:50:29,344 --> 00:50:31,008
I'm not here to fight.

563
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,692
Where's your wizard friend?

564
00:50:32,706 --> 00:50:34,438
He's gone!

565
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:36,190
Sparrowhawk's not here.

566
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,412
You'd better not be hiding him.

567
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:41,585
Why Should I?

568
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,425
You're no match for him.

569
00:50:45,594 --> 00:50:47,747
Looks like she's telling the truth.

570
00:50:47,767 --> 00:50:49,920
All right, we'll be back!

571
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,554
Till then!

572
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,725
Never come back, you swine!

573
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,729
Lord Cob will reward me for this!

574
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,086
So that's what happened.

575
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,458
Neither of you said a word about it.

576
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,379
I think we fixed most of it.

577
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:30,755
Let's rebuild the fence.

578
00:51:33,642 --> 00:51:36,188
Tenar?

579
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:38,754
Have you known Sparrowhawk for a long time?

580
00:51:38,772 --> 00:51:40,442
Yes, I guess I have.

581
00:51:40,462 --> 00:51:42,132
A long, long time.

582
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,646
He's always been a wanderer.

583
00:51:47,364 --> 00:51:49,995
It's the life he chose.

584
00:51:50,015 --> 00:51:52,646
He does it because he has to.

585
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:57,790
And finally he became Archmage, the greatest of all wizards.

586
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,876
Head of the Great House of Roke?

587
00:52:00,878 --> 00:52:02,758
Yes.

588
00:52:02,778 --> 00:52:04,658
But years before that, he rescued me.

589
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:10,674
Rescued me, and led me into the light.

590
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:18,974
One man, all alone.

591
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:24,479
He brought me out of the Tombs of Atuan.

592
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:45,170
Welcome.

593
00:52:45,464 --> 00:52:47,782
Don't get many wizards.

594
00:52:47,802 --> 00:52:50,120
Looking for a weapon?

595
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,173
Show me that sword.

596
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,592
Can't recommend this one.

597
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,311
Very unusual workmanship, so I bought it.

598
00:53:01,313 --> 00:53:02,943
But it's rusted solid.

599
00:53:02,963 --> 00:53:04,593
Can't be drawn.

600
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,317
You there, wizard!

601
00:53:16,203 --> 00:53:17,582
Are you deaf?

602
00:53:17,602 --> 00:53:18,981
I'm talking to you!

603
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,331
You said something, sir?

604
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:27,421
Is there something stuck to my face?

605
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,665
Wrong wizard!

606
00:53:29,675 --> 00:53:31,766
You!

607
00:53:31,786 --> 00:53:33,877
If you see a wizard with a scar on his face...

608
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,926
...tell him Lord Cob wants to see him!

609
00:53:37,266 --> 00:53:39,562
Cob?

610
00:53:39,582 --> 00:53:41,878
Never heard that name back where I come from.

611
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:45,230
You will, when he's Lord of the Two Lands!

612
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,690
Don't forget it!

613
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,310
Yes sir.

614
00:53:51,613 --> 00:53:52,890
I'll take the sword.

615
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:54,187
How much?

616
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:57,736
Wait a minute... your face!

617
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,319
What's wrong?

618
00:53:59,329 --> 00:54:00,333
Nothing...

619
00:54:00,353 --> 00:54:01,357
I suppose.

620
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:05,118
Have you heard of this wizard named Cob?

621
00:54:05,127 --> 00:54:06,592
Careful!

622
00:54:06,612 --> 00:54:08,077
Keep your voice down.

623
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:13,668
Only wizard in these parts who still has his powers.

624
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:17,467
Can't say he's loved by people around here.

625
00:54:17,473 --> 00:54:19,501
He lives in the fortress outside town.

626
00:54:19,521 --> 00:54:21,549
Best keep away from there.

627
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:29,270
I never thought I'd find you here, Cob.

628
00:54:36,867 --> 00:54:39,060
You're good at farm work.

629
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,273
You hardly seem a beginner.

630
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,700
Thank you.

631
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:47,289
Won't you stay on for a while and help?

632
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,412
Therru would like that too.

633
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,412
But...

634
00:54:50,422 --> 00:54:52,342
You don't have to decide now.

635
00:54:52,362 --> 00:54:54,282
Think about it, all right?

636
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,417
All right.

637
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,254
Stable the ox for me.

638
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,254
Yes, Tenar.

639
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:04,848
I'm home!

640
00:55:05,187 --> 00:55:07,340
Therru?

641
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,513
Now where is she?

642
00:55:15,155 --> 00:55:16,735
Arren!

643
00:55:16,755 --> 00:55:18,335
I can't find Therru.

644
00:55:18,355 --> 00:55:19,935
Check the back pasture for me.

645
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:22,821
Tell her to come inside before dark.

646
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:24,329
I will.

647
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,344
Therru?

648
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:49,604
Therru...

649
00:55:49,596 --> 00:58:37,018
Fan far above the clouds against the setting sun A falcon flies alone soaring in the wind I hear his lonely cry so sad must he be Riding the silent wind a falcon flies alone Reaching out with his wings grasps the empty sky Riding the silent wind never can he rest What it is within my heart none can ever know A heart like a falcon's is this very heart What it is within my heart none can ever know Lonely falcon in the empty sky I walk alone along deserted country roads Walking with me side by side you are always there I feel your loneliness lonely you must be Crickets whispering in the grassy fields You walk there by my side you walk the path with me But you never say a word never do you speak What it is within my heart none can ever know Here inside this heart that walks its path alone What it is within my heart none can ever know The sadness of one who always is alone I killed my father.

650
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:41,231
I stabbed him and ran away.

651
00:58:41,611 --> 00:58:43,491
I don't understand it.

652
00:58:43,511 --> 00:58:45,391
Why did I kill him?

653
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:48,071
Did he hurt you?

654
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,267
No.

655
00:58:50,287 --> 00:58:51,644
My father was a great man.

656
00:58:52,164 --> 00:58:54,585
I am nothing.

657
00:58:54,605 --> 00:58:57,026
I failed my father and I fail myself.

658
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:02,839
And yet, I'm filled with a rage I can't control.

659
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:07,466
It's as if there were someone else inside me.

660
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,088
You saw it too, didn't you?

661
00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:12,564
You were right.

662
00:59:12,584 --> 00:59:14,299
I shouldn't be here.

663
00:59:14,561 --> 00:59:15,400
I'm sorry.

664
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,259
I didn't mean...

665
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,263
No, you were right.

666
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,520
If I don't leave, it will come again.

667
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,203
A woman?

668
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:39,827
She lives past the marshes.

669
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:43,835
And the Archmage is with her?

670
00:59:44,299 --> 00:59:46,555
He was seen in the town.

671
00:59:46,575 --> 00:59:48,831
There are many witnesses.

672
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,970
Splendid.

673
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,646
My lord.

674
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,559
Let's go, men!

675
01:00:24,339 --> 01:00:26,094
A greeting from the Archmage.

676
01:00:26,114 --> 01:00:27,869
Thank you, Sparrowhawk.

677
01:00:42,941 --> 01:00:43,854
Therru!

678
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:44,787
Arren!

679
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:45,720
Dinner is ready!

680
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:48,028
Where's Arren?

681
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,023
Isn't he with you?

682
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,023
No.

683
01:00:52,576 --> 01:00:54,621
Maybe he's resting.

684
01:00:54,641 --> 01:00:56,686
Therru, go see if he's there.

685
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:57,867
Yes, Tenar.

686
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:02,626
He's not here.

687
01:01:03,295 --> 01:01:04,799
That's strange.

688
01:01:04,819 --> 01:01:06,323
Where's he gone?

689
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,628
I'll look outside.

690
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,275
Arren...

691
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:44,747
Tenar, Therru... take care.

692
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,859
Doesn't matter which way I go.

693
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,042
Looks like a dead end.

694
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:47,810
It's here!

695
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,217
I wonder if that's Arren?

696
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,020
Arren?

697
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,226
Sparrowhawk?

698
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,531
That's odd.

699
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:22,822
What are you doing?

700
01:04:24,412 --> 01:04:25,229
It's you!

701
01:04:25,249 --> 01:04:26,066
You're back!

702
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:31,251
So sorry, but it seems you'll do in place of the wizard.

703
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,118
What?

704
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,665
Tenar, what's wrong?

705
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:34,662
Run away!

706
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,289
What a surprise!

707
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,384
Fancy meeting you here, princess.

708
01:04:42,013 --> 01:04:43,120
No!

709
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:44,247
Leave her alone!

710
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,101
Therru!

711
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:58,111
Well now princess, where's your prince?

712
01:04:58,446 --> 01:04:59,240
Hey!

713
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,054
Watch those teeth!

714
01:05:00,448 --> 01:05:02,744
I need you to deliver a message.

715
01:05:02,764 --> 01:05:05,060
Tell this to the wizard!

716
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,908
If he wants his woman...

717
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:11,909
...he can find her at Lord Cob's castle.

718
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:13,959
Take her away!

719
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:14,874
Therru!

720
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,792
Tenar!

721
01:05:17,632 --> 01:05:19,614
Let me go, I tell you!

722
01:05:19,634 --> 01:05:21,616
Let me go!

723
01:05:26,224 --> 01:05:27,164
Therru!

724
01:05:27,184 --> 01:05:28,124
Are you all right?

725
01:05:28,144 --> 01:05:29,084
Therru!

726
01:05:29,102 --> 01:05:30,231
Stop it!

727
01:05:30,251 --> 01:05:31,380
Let her go!

728
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:36,017
You stay here and be good till the wizard gets back!

729
01:05:37,986 --> 01:05:39,178
Lord Cob's waiting.

730
01:05:39,198 --> 01:05:40,390
Let's get moving!

731
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,109
Tenar!

732
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,825
Tenar!

733
01:06:21,112 --> 01:06:23,032
I'm sorry.

734
01:06:23,052 --> 01:06:24,972
I'm afraid he's coming with me.

735
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,196
Go!

736
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:59,391
Where am I?

737
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:03,031
You're safe now.

738
01:07:03,051 --> 01:07:05,347
The Shadow can't follow you here.

739
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,653
You saw it?

740
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:11,365
I know a bit of Magic myself.

741
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,660
I know what you're running from.

742
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:18,876
You were wise to flee from that man.

743
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,003
What man?

744
01:07:21,005 --> 01:07:22,925
Sparrowhawk.

745
01:07:22,945 --> 01:07:24,865
That is, the Archmage.

746
01:07:25,927 --> 01:07:27,807
Here, drink this.

747
01:07:27,827 --> 01:07:29,707
It will soothe you.

748
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:37,600
What's wrong? it's not poisoned.

749
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:56,118
Now lie still and rest here for a bit.

750
01:07:56,364 --> 01:08:00,790
The Archmage is more dangerous than you can imagine.

751
01:08:01,296 --> 01:08:02,841
No...

752
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:04,406
Sparrowhawk is a good man.

753
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,792
He protected me.

754
01:08:07,343 --> 01:08:09,724
Then tell me.

755
01:08:09,744 --> 01:08:12,125
Did you ever wonder what he seeks?

756
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,134
No.

757
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:20,813
He seeks eternal life.

758
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:24,309
Eternal life?

759
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:29,648
The Archmage stands at the pinnacle of sorcery.

760
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:35,074
Only the secret of eternal life lies beyond his grasp.

761
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:38,452
And yet, he covets it.

762
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:43,453
But as he covets, so does he fear another will discover it first.

763
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:49,085
That would be unbearable to one so proud as the Archmage.

764
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:52,132
What does that have to do with me?

765
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,884
Because it is you who have been chosen...

766
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:59,477
...to gain the secret of eternal life.

767
01:09:00,396 --> 01:09:02,754
That's why Sparrowhawk follows you.

768
01:09:02,774 --> 01:09:05,132
To kill you.

769
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,189
To bring me death...

770
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:10,648
Arren, will you come with me?

771
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:13,195
I've already found it.

772
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:16,570
I found the door between life and death.

773
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,574
Together we can open that door.

774
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:23,331
And together, we will live forever.

775
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:27,126
We will conquer every form of fear and suffering.

776
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,590
Fear and suffering...

777
01:09:31,219 --> 01:09:33,139
Come with me, Arren.

778
01:09:33,159 --> 01:09:35,079
The face of death is terrible!

779
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:41,599
I don't want to die.

780
01:09:41,896 --> 01:09:43,964
Listen to me, Arren.

781
01:09:43,984 --> 01:09:46,052
Tell me your True Name.

782
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:49,607
Then you will have that which you most desire.

783
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:56,660
Come, give me your True Name.

784
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:02,624
Lebannen...

785
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:12,709
Now I'm ready for you, Sparrowhawk.

786
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:24,346
Where are you, Hawk?

787
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,216
Hawk!

788
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,471
What's wrong, Therru?

789
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:10,479
They came and took Tenar away!

790
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:13,319
You have to go to Cob's castle!

791
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:14,528
Where is Arren?

792
01:11:15,031 --> 01:11:17,264
He left!

793
01:11:17,284 --> 01:11:19,517
He said it would come again if he didn't go!

794
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:21,990
Cob...

795
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,530
Don't worry, Therru.

796
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:27,962
I'm going to help Tenar.

797
01:11:27,982 --> 01:11:30,027
Wait for my return.

798
01:11:30,797 --> 01:11:32,904
Keep this sword.

799
01:11:32,924 --> 01:11:35,031
Arren will need it.

800
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:44,343
Stay home, Therru!

801
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,533
Here-we-are!

802
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,118
Come on!

803
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:08,536
I'm not going anywhere!

804
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:14,213
Lord Cob.

805
01:12:14,715 --> 01:12:16,618
We brought the woman.

806
01:12:16,638 --> 01:12:18,541
Just as you ordered.

807
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:22,513
You've done well, Hare.

808
01:12:22,723 --> 01:12:25,291
It was nothing, my lord.

809
01:12:25,311 --> 01:12:27,879
My pleasure is to serve you.

810
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,520
Stand aside!

811
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,230
Why, you!

812
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,099
Are you the boss?

813
01:12:33,442 --> 01:12:35,259
Why did you kidnap me?

814
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:37,096
Let me go right now!

815
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:40,865
So sorry for the rough treatment.

816
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:43,110
I have business with Sparrowhawk.

817
01:12:43,327 --> 01:12:45,856
You're a wizard, aren't you!

818
01:12:45,876 --> 01:12:48,405
You should be ashamed!

819
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,909
Go find him yourself!

820
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:54,254
He's an old friend of mine.

821
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:57,419
I'd like to invite him here.

822
01:12:58,092 --> 01:12:59,909
And I'm the bait!

823
01:12:59,929 --> 01:13:01,746
You're going to hurt him!

824
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:05,090
Women tax my patience.

825
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:07,550
Put her in the dungeon.

826
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:09,852
DO it!

827
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,271
Answer me!

828
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:16,101
If something happens to Sparrowhawk, so help me!

829
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:18,690
Arren...

830
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:20,108
This way!

831
01:13:30,124 --> 01:13:32,255
Come, Lebannen.

832
01:13:32,275 --> 01:13:34,406
I have something special for you.

833
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,272
Get in there!

834
01:14:11,749 --> 01:14:13,919
Make yourself at home.

835
01:14:13,939 --> 01:14:16,109
You'll see your wizard soon enough.

836
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:37,273
This place reminds me of the Tombs.

837
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:40,772
Sparrowhawk...

838
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:54,335
Cob!

839
01:14:54,355 --> 01:14:56,150
Are you making the same mistake again?

840
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,300
At ease!

841
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:07,428
Any sign of the wizard?

842
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,422
Not yet, sir.

843
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:13,723
Where is that confounded wizard?

844
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:17,729
Let's see...

845
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:23,155
There he is!

846
01:15:23,175 --> 01:15:24,720
Take your positions!

847
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,326
Here he comes!

848
01:15:40,046 --> 01:15:41,300
Don't let him escape!

849
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,574
Now!

850
01:15:46,761 --> 01:15:47,742
Hear me!

851
01:15:47,762 --> 01:15:48,743
Open the path!

852
01:15:53,142 --> 01:15:53,708
Stop!

853
01:15:53,728 --> 01:15:54,294
Wait!

854
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,516
He tricked us!

855
01:15:57,521 --> 01:15:58,650
Well?

856
01:15:58,670 --> 01:15:59,799
Don't just stand there!

857
01:16:06,363 --> 01:16:08,220
Cob! it's Sparrowhawk.

858
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,097
I'm here!

859
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:11,905
Show yourself!

860
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:19,291
It's been a long time, Sparrowhawk.

861
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,786
I've been waiting.

862
01:16:22,379 --> 01:16:23,883
Cob of Havnor!

863
01:16:23,903 --> 01:16:25,407
I left you at the border...

864
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:27,341
...of the land of death.

865
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,129
I hear you're the Archmage now.

866
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:33,096
Congratulations.

867
01:16:33,682 --> 01:16:35,460
I'm here, Cob.

868
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,258
Now release Tenar!

869
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:41,267
You're pitiful, Sparrowhawk.

870
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:45,643
The great Archmage, smitten by a woman.

871
01:16:45,903 --> 01:16:47,760
You used her to lure me here.

872
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:49,637
What do you want?

873
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,066
What do you think?

874
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:54,444
I haven't forgotten how you dragged me...

875
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:57,287
...to the gates of the Dry Land.

876
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:00,079
But you've forgotten why!

877
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:02,668
You used the Pelnish Lore...

878
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:06,372
...to toy with the spirits of the living and the dead.

879
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:08,500
Isn't that enough to repent?

880
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:13,300
You taught me a splendid lesson there at death's door.

881
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:16,557
Now I know I can never accept extinction.

882
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:21,183
So I gathered every ancient lore book I could find.

883
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:25,479
Alas, some of their owners were not cooperative.

884
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:29,987
What evil are you planning, Cob?

885
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:33,532
I've done it, Sparrowhawk!

886
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:36,653
I've woven the greatest spell of all.

887
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:40,327
The door between life and death has been closed...

888
01:17:40,332 --> 01:17:42,235
...since the beginning of time.

889
01:17:42,255 --> 01:17:44,158
But I will open it!

890
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:46,112
That is forbidden!

891
01:17:46,132 --> 01:17:48,074
Don't you understand?

892
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,926
Those with power must wield it with wisdom.

893
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:55,008
Would you destroy the Balance that sustains the world?

894
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,848
What nonsense!

895
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,014
The Balance is long gone.

896
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:04,514
You know that better than anyone.

897
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:07,016
The Balance was destroyed by Man.

898
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:13,027
You think you can limit Man's desire? it's impossible!

899
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:16,116
I will live forever.

900
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:19,032
I will gain existence without end!

901
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:22,023
Cob!

902
01:18:22,043 --> 01:18:24,736
Without the cycle of death and rebirth, there is no life!

903
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:27,415
I am above Nature!

904
01:18:34,428 --> 01:18:36,331
Sparrowhawk!

905
01:18:36,351 --> 01:18:38,254
There's someone else who wants to meet you.

906
01:18:47,316 --> 01:18:48,610
Arren!

907
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:49,924
What are you doing here?

908
01:18:49,944 --> 01:18:52,240
Lebannen!

909
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,556
This man would deprive you of eternal life!

910
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:02,982
Arren!

911
01:19:03,002 --> 01:19:04,404
Did you reveal your True Name?

912
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:09,996
I'm going to live forever!

913
01:19:13,217 --> 01:19:15,097
I'm tired, Sparrowhawk.

914
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:16,997
Tired of living in fear.

915
01:19:17,388 --> 01:19:18,870
Arren!

916
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:20,372
Life without death is not life!

917
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:25,011
Refuse death, and you refuse life as well!

918
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,934
Don't lie to me!

919
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:49,038
Listen to me, Arren.

920
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:53,289
No man nor any thing in this world lives forever.

921
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:57,673
But only to us is it given to know that we must die.

922
01:19:58,002 --> 01:20:02,473
And that is a precious gift.

923
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:08,847
This life that is our torment and our treasure does not endure.

924
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:11,349
It is a wave on the sea.

925
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:15,694
Would you force the sea to grow still, to save one wave?

926
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:17,814
To save yourself?

927
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:29,867
Arren...

928
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:42,846
Thought you made a fool of me?

929
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,474
There's more than one entrance to this castle!

930
01:20:47,394 --> 01:20:48,876
What's happening?

931
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,378
I'm getting weak.

932
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:56,026
Coming here was another of your blunders, Sparrowhawk.

933
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:58,862
Your powers are useless in this place.

934
01:20:59,156 --> 01:21:01,161
Hare!

935
01:21:01,181 --> 01:21:03,186
Put him in the dungeon with the woman.

936
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,069
I'll finish them tomorrow...

937
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:08,740
...in the most painful and humiliating way.

938
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:10,874
Yes, my lord.

939
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:13,369
On your feet, chickenhawk!

940
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:37,776
Sparrowhawk!

941
01:21:38,195 --> 01:21:39,427
Sparrowhawk!

942
01:21:39,447 --> 01:21:40,679
Are you all right?

943
01:21:40,699 --> 01:21:41,931
Sparrowhawk!

944
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:44,066
It'll all be over tomorrow.

945
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:47,445
Say your goodbyes while you still have time!

946
01:21:58,298 --> 01:21:59,279
Sparrowhawk!

947
01:21:59,299 --> 01:22:00,280
Sparrowhawk!

948
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:02,801
Tenar...

949
01:22:02,803 --> 01:22:04,706
How did they do this?

950
01:22:04,726 --> 01:22:06,629
You're the Archmage!

951
01:22:07,391 --> 01:22:09,373
I'm sorry, Tenar.

952
01:22:09,393 --> 01:22:11,375
I keep getting you into trouble.

953
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:13,763
Stop talking nonsense!

954
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,827
Which way should I go?

955
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:40,463
Arren?

956
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,331
Arren!

957
01:22:47,351 --> 01:22:48,002
Wait!

958
01:22:48,932 --> 01:22:51,211
Arren!

959
01:22:51,231 --> 01:22:53,510
Cob's men came and took Tenar away!

960
01:23:04,031 --> 01:23:06,247
Arren, your sword!

961
01:23:06,267 --> 01:23:08,483
Sparrowhawk said to give it to you!

962
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:17,289
Follow you?

963
01:23:57,491 --> 01:24:00,995
Tenar is a prisoner here.

964
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:02,246
Sparrowhawk too.

965
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:04,714
Even Sparrowhawk.

966
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:07,016
This is yours, isn't it?

967
01:24:07,036 --> 01:24:09,002
Sparrowhawk brought it for you.

968
01:24:10,347 --> 01:24:11,937
We've got to hurry.

969
01:24:11,957 --> 01:24:13,547
They need our help!

970
01:24:14,893 --> 01:24:16,961
I can go no further.

971
01:24:16,981 --> 01:24:19,049
You must go alone.

972
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:22,775
Bring me that sword.

973
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,269
I know you can do it.

974
01:24:26,363 --> 01:24:28,055
What do you mean?

975
01:24:28,075 --> 01:24:29,767
You're right here.

976
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:32,447
I'm not here.

977
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,284
Cob is holding me against my will.

978
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:38,870
Then who are you?

979
01:24:39,293 --> 01:24:40,360
Stay away!

980
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:41,447
Get back!

981
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:44,080
Don't come closer!

982
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,929
Arren's heart was always full of fear.

983
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:57,096
The fear filled his heart with darkness.

984
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,100
Fear of what?

985
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:04,608
The darkness stole his body and ran away with it.

986
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:07,815
But it left something important behind.

987
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:17,868
Wherever there is darkness, there also you will find light.

988
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:20,332
Now the light that was left behind...

989
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,955
...wanders alone, like a shadow.

990
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:24,836
A Shadow?

991
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:31,799
What you see now is just a shadow chasing its body.

992
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:40,511
Father...

993
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:45,107
You are Arren, aren't you?

994
01:25:47,194 --> 01:25:48,909
Don't worry.

995
01:25:48,929 --> 01:25:50,644
I'll be with you.

996
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:54,237
I'll give you my True Name.

997
01:25:54,951 --> 01:25:57,332
My True Name is Lebannen...

998
01:25:57,352 --> 01:25:59,733
Lebannen.

999
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:02,995
Lebannen...

1000
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:17,858
lt's him.

1001
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:24,532
He should be ashamed to call himself Archmage!

1002
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:27,956
Remember who he was up against.

1003
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:30,295
No wizard in Earthsea is a match for Lord Cob!

1004
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:31,789
Well spoken!

1005
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:37,344
By the way, what's our little friend up to?

1006
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:39,929
He shut himself in his room.

1007
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,925
Arren's really here!

1008
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:45,969
He's a lucky one, that boy.

1009
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:50,896
It's just like Lord Cob to steal the wizard's apprentice.

1010
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:53,940
He's not much use though, is he?

1011
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:55,737
None at all.

1012
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:59,609
When we're through with the wizard, we'll sell the boy!

1013
01:28:09,085 --> 01:28:10,613
All right!

1014
01:28:10,633 --> 01:28:12,161
Go get Sparrowhawk and his woman.

1015
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:16,167
The Archmage's time has finally run out!

1016
01:28:18,084 --> 01:28:20,178
They're going to kill them.

1017
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:37,293
Arren!

1018
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,091
Arren?

1019
01:29:42,512 --> 01:29:44,392
What are you doing here?

1020
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:46,292
Did they kidnap you too?

1021
01:29:55,025 --> 01:29:56,364
Here.

1022
01:29:56,384 --> 01:29:57,723
This belongs to you.

1023
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:01,400
I'm not worthy to hold my father's sword.

1024
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:05,951
Arren, they've got Tenar and Sparrowhawk.

1025
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:07,740
They're going to kill them.

1026
01:30:07,746 --> 01:30:09,250
Please!

1027
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:10,774
Help them like you helped me!

1028
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:13,534
I can't help anyone.

1029
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:16,787
All I Can do is fail.

1030
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:18,914
What's wrong with you?

1031
01:30:18,914 --> 01:30:21,667
They'll die if we don't do something!

1032
01:30:26,056 --> 01:30:27,811
They'll die!

1033
01:30:27,831 --> 01:30:29,586
We'll lose both of them!

1034
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:42,446
We'll lose the most important thing in the world.

1035
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:47,651
Therru?

1036
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,536
What's the most important thing?

1037
01:30:57,202 --> 01:30:59,546
Life is the most important thing!

1038
01:31:00,548 --> 01:31:02,889
We'll all die someday.

1039
01:31:02,909 --> 01:31:05,250
What does it matter?

1040
01:31:05,762 --> 01:31:08,433
Why fight for life?

1041
01:31:08,453 --> 01:31:11,124
We know it's going to end anyway.

1042
01:31:11,142 --> 01:31:13,062
No!

1043
01:31:13,082 --> 01:31:15,002
Life is precious because we know we're going to die!

1044
01:31:15,021 --> 01:31:17,339
You're not afraid of death.

1045
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:19,677
You're afraid of life!

1046
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:23,065
You want to live forever, then you say nothing matters.

1047
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:25,109
It's the same thing!

1048
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:28,367
You're afraid to live the only life you have!

1049
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:30,697
Therru...

1050
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:33,325
You think your life belongs to you?

1051
01:31:36,459 --> 01:31:38,254
Tenar gave me life.

1052
01:31:38,274 --> 01:31:40,069
That's why I have to live...

1053
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:43,048
...to give life to someone else.

1054
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:48,219
Lebannen...

1055
01:31:49,462 --> 01:31:52,557
That's the only way we live forever.

1056
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:10,526
Therru... how did you know my True Name?

1057
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:12,990
You told me yourself.

1058
01:32:15,915 --> 01:32:18,171
Now I'll tell you mine.

1059
01:32:18,191 --> 01:32:20,447
My True Name is...

1060
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:23,422
Tehanu... it's Tehanu.

1061
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:25,916
Tehanu...

1062
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,448
it'll be dawn soon.

1063
01:32:51,409 --> 01:32:52,874
Come on, Therru.

1064
01:32:52,894 --> 01:32:54,359
We've got to help them!

1065
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:05,626
Arren, wait!

1066
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:07,464
What is it?

1067
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:08,504
There!

1068
01:33:14,047 --> 01:33:15,890
It's Sparrowhawk and Tenar!

1069
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:17,967
Come on!

1070
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:23,473
Jump!

1071
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:26,151
I can't! it's too far!

1072
01:33:26,152 --> 01:33:27,133
Don't worry!

1073
01:33:27,153 --> 01:33:28,134
You can do it!

1074
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:36,410
Let's go!

1075
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:05,311
Sparrowhawk!

1076
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:09,523
Time to say goodbye, Sparrowhawk.

1077
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:13,489
Your lover is going on a journey.

1078
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:16,030
Why don't you send him off yourself?

1079
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:25,164
Don't worry, Sparrowhawk.

1080
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:28,164
This world will be in good hands after you're gone.

1081
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:32,459
What can I do, Sparrowhawk?

1082
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:34,169
Tenar.

1083
01:34:34,846 --> 01:34:36,999
It's not over yet.

1084
01:34:37,019 --> 01:34:39,172
The sun will rise soon.

1085
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,385
What do you mean?

1086
01:34:43,605 --> 01:34:46,151
Don't you hear it, Tenar?

1087
01:34:46,171 --> 01:34:48,717
Help is almost here.

1088
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:54,697
That's enough time for goodbyes.

1089
01:34:55,158 --> 01:34:56,390
Do it!

1090
01:34:56,410 --> 01:34:57,642
Finish him!

1091
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:58,867
No!

1092
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:04,036
Let them go!

1093
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:05,791
Ll'S you!

1094
01:35:05,793 --> 01:35:06,569
Arren!

1095
01:35:06,589 --> 01:35:07,365
Therru!

1096
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:10,038
Stay out of this, boy!

1097
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,549
Don't show him any mercy!

1098
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:15,419
Get back!

1099
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:21,887
Take him!

1100
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:35,779
Please don't hurt me!

1101
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:38,362
I'm disappointed.

1102
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:41,786
I thought you and I had an understanding.

1103
01:35:42,205 --> 01:35:43,983
Silence!

1104
01:35:44,003 --> 01:35:45,781
You don't control me any more.

1105
01:35:46,115 --> 01:35:50,586
Then you shall see the face of death, Lebannen!

1106
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:58,302
A summoning spell!

1107
01:36:03,508 --> 01:36:04,475
Arren!

1108
01:36:04,467 --> 01:36:05,935
Stay back!

1109
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:09,222
Now die!

1110
01:36:29,335 --> 01:36:30,567
Please!

1111
01:36:30,587 --> 01:36:31,819
Let me draw it.

1112
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:34,747
For Life!

1113
01:37:12,368 --> 01:37:15,872
That sword was forged with magic!

1114
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:41,235
He's an old man!

1115
01:37:41,773 --> 01:37:43,741
Disguised by sorcery.

1116
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:46,327
Lord Cob!

1117
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,374
You can't stop me.

1118
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:54,578
I will never accept death.

1119
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:58,753
Wizards shouldn't fear death!

1120
01:37:59,207 --> 01:38:01,255
You wretched girl!

1121
01:38:02,251 --> 01:38:03,924
I'm not like you!

1122
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:05,332
I'm better than you.

1123
01:38:05,352 --> 01:38:06,754
Insignificant worms!

1124
01:38:07,215 --> 01:38:09,764
I studied the wisdom of the ages!

1125
01:38:09,769 --> 01:38:11,547
I wield power!

1126
01:38:11,567 --> 01:38:13,345
I am almighty!

1127
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:19,816
Scorned as a fool by the wizards of Roke.

1128
01:38:19,811 --> 01:38:21,939
Driven out like a dog!

1129
01:38:23,783 --> 01:38:25,936
But I'll have my revenge.

1130
01:38:25,956 --> 01:38:28,109
I will never die.

1131
01:38:28,111 --> 01:38:31,456
I'll be the supreme Archmage!

1132
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:47,804
Therru!

1133
01:39:20,246 --> 01:39:21,839
Therru!

1134
01:39:30,256 --> 01:39:32,179
That little fool!

1135
01:39:32,602 --> 01:39:34,693
Hear me, stones.

1136
01:39:34,713 --> 01:39:36,804
I unbind you!

1137
01:40:27,772 --> 01:40:29,900
Sunrise...

1138
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,157
Let me go!

1139
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:39,993
Does it hurt, girl?

1140
01:40:39,992 --> 01:40:41,084
Cob!

1141
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:44,376
Let her go!

1142
01:40:44,705 --> 01:40:46,673
Stay back!

1143
01:40:46,666 --> 01:40:49,761
Death is terrifying!

1144
01:40:50,795 --> 01:40:51,921
Don't do it!

1145
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:58,553
So terrifying.

1146
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:04,149
Wait!

1147
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:31,586
So terrifying... very terrifying...

1148
01:41:31,929 --> 01:41:33,433
Cob!

1149
01:41:33,453 --> 01:41:34,957
You're just like me.

1150
01:41:35,464 --> 01:41:39,139
You turn away from light and see only darkness!

1151
01:41:41,022 --> 01:41:42,003
No!

1152
01:41:42,023 --> 01:41:43,004
Keep away!

1153
01:41:45,266 --> 01:41:47,894
You forgot that all life is connected.

1154
01:41:48,227 --> 01:41:51,231
Life can't be hoarded, it can only be given!

1155
01:41:51,814 --> 01:41:55,068
Deny death, and you deny life!

1156
01:41:55,494 --> 01:41:56,788
No!

1157
01:41:56,808 --> 01:41:58,102
You're wrong!

1158
01:41:59,373 --> 01:42:01,315
Face the truth, Cob!

1159
01:42:01,335 --> 01:42:03,277
Everyone fears death!

1160
01:42:04,670 --> 01:42:06,903
No!

1161
01:42:06,923 --> 01:42:09,156
I don't want to die.

1162
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:11,296
Cob!

1163
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:13,628
No!

1164
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:15,842
Therru!

1165
01:42:26,901 --> 01:42:28,008
Therru...

1166
01:42:28,028 --> 01:42:29,135
Arren...

1167
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:39,866
Arren!

1168
01:42:50,091 --> 01:42:51,408
Time to die!

1169
01:42:51,428 --> 01:42:52,745
Time to die!

1170
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,002
Arren!

1171
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:57,380
And you will join him.

1172
01:43:03,479 --> 01:43:04,818
Let her go!

1173
01:43:04,838 --> 01:43:06,177
Don't kill her!

1174
01:43:08,933 --> 01:43:13,029
All who oppose me must die!

1175
01:43:42,685 --> 01:43:44,627
She's dead, she's dead.

1176
01:43:44,647 --> 01:43:46,589
Poor thing.

1177
01:43:57,356 --> 01:43:59,575
Sun is rising.

1178
01:44:03,446 --> 01:44:06,700
Hurry... must hurry...

1179
01:44:06,699 --> 01:44:08,121
Stop!

1180
01:44:45,404 --> 01:44:46,781
Therru!

1181
01:44:54,371 --> 01:44:58,251
Eternal life!

1182
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:05,474
Shadow, return to darkness!

1183
01:45:07,259 --> 01:45:09,682
Give me life!

1184
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:18,689
I want life... life!

1185
01:45:25,611 --> 01:45:27,204
Life!

1186
01:45:32,493 --> 01:45:35,667
I want to live!

1187
01:46:05,901 --> 01:46:08,905
Tehanu!

1188
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:54,245
So you're safe too.

1189
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:00,873
What about them?

1190
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:03,828
They'll be fine.

1191
01:47:03,848 --> 01:47:05,876
They have wings.

1192
01:48:29,263 --> 01:48:30,477
Thank you...

1193
01:48:30,497 --> 01:48:31,711
Therru.

1194
01:48:38,137 --> 01:48:40,936
I'm going back to pay for my crime.

1195
01:48:42,099 --> 01:48:44,602
And to face myself.

1196
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:47,904
Arren.

1197
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:53,570
Can I come to see you again someday?

1198
01:48:59,283 --> 01:49:00,375
Come on.

1199
01:49:00,576 --> 01:49:03,750
We have to thank Sparrowhawk and Tenar.

1200

The lone hawk in the sky Struggles against the wind Here there is only light and darkness He has the sky to himself You who looked up to the sky and wept You who who live alone Let me hear your True Name For one day you'll be gone As light dissolves into darkness Your song passes straight through my heart Let me sing it for you The End Voices Junichi Okada Aoi Teshima Yuko Tanaka Teruyuki Kagawa Jun Fubuki Bunta Sugawara Based on the “Earthsea” series by Ursula K.
