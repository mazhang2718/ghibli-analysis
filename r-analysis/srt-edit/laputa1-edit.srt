1
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,150
Pirates!

2
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,820
We're under attack!

3
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,010
Hold them off!

4
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,560
Get down on the floor.

5
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,270
Tear gas!

6
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,490
What are you waiting for?

7
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,150
Break it down!

8
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,420
Where'd she go?

9
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,920
There she is!

10
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,340
She's getting away!

11
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,550
Well, get her!

12
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,850
Mama, don't drop me!

13
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,330
There's the stone.

14
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,920
Quick, go next door!

15
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,230
Get that crystal!

16
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,020
There goes the crystal.

17
00:03:52,620 --> 00:06:24,720
Castle in the Sky Two meatballs, please.

18
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,600
Working late?

19
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,990
We're finally busy again.

20
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,750
Still working?

21
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,780
Yeah.

22
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,710
What's that?

23
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,720
A person!

24
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,690
Pazu!

25
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,765
What are you up to?

26
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:51,850
Where's my dinner?

27
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,700
Boss!

28
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,700
A girl fell from the sky.

29
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,890
Boss, she fell from the sky...

30
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,930
Darn old clunker.

31
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,945
Boss!

32
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:24,970
A girl...

33
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,480
Close Valve No. 2!

34
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,860
Ouch!

35
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,340
Pazu, toss me a wrench.

36
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,065
I'm busy here.

37
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:45,950
You take it.

38
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,530
Don't make them wait.

39
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,410
Keep a steady hand.

40
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,610
Brake!

41
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,620
Any luck?

42
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,170
No silver, no tin even.

43
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,740
All that wasted work.

44
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,170
Should we try the east vein?

45
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,970
That's riddled with old holes.

46
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,090
We'll have to start over.

47
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,390
That's enough for today.

48
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,635
Shut down the boiler.

49
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:56,020
Call it a day.

50
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,280
I'll go under at this rate.

51
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,610
Oil the clunker, Pazu.

52
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,470
Mama, we couldn't find her. lt's too dark.

53
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,390
I hope you really looked!

54
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,625
All right.

55
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,260
We'll wait for daylight.

56
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,597
Hi.

57
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:14,034
How are you feeling?

58
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,471
Hey, come on guys...

59
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,760
I'm Pazu.

60
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,520
I live here by myself.

61
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,860
They eat after I play.

62
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,210
So you are human after all.

63
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,210
I was afraid you were an angel.

64
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,740
Thanks for helping me.

65
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,710
I'm Sheeta.

66
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,613
Sheeta, nice name.

67
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,036
You fell from the sky.

68
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:53,459
A bit scary.

69
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,095
That's right.

70
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:57,870
Why am I still alive?

71
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,610
I fell from the airship...

72
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,190
Don't you remember?

73
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,110
No.

74
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,410
Say, can I see that?

75
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,560
This?

76
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,920
It's been in my family forever.

77
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,455
It's beautiful.

78
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:22,730
Here...

79
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,640
Watch this!

80
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:41,600
Pazu!

81
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,750
So it wasn't the stone after all.

82
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,090
Oh, no!

83
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,600
Pazu!

84
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,280
Are you OK?

85
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:28,935
Yeah.

86
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:29,600
Are you?

87
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,705
I'm fine.

88
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:31,810
Sorry, did it hurt?

89
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,240
No, my head's harder than my boss's fists.

90
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,650
The pot's still boiling.

91
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,545
Hungry?

92
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:45,450
Let's eat.

93
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,670
Wash up over there.

94
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,330
There's a towel.

95
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,590
Thank you.

96
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,700
Laputa...

97
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,935
Sheeta!

98
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:19,440
Where are you?

99
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,380
My father took that picture.

100
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,380
That's Laputa, an island in the sky.

101
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,590
An island in the sky...?

102
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,640
They say it's only a myth.

103
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,560
But my father saw it.

104
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,850
He took it from an airship.

105
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,710
There's a Laputa in Gulliver's Travels, but Swift made it up.

106
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,520
Dad drew this.

107
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,320
He said the abandoned palace was full of treasure.

108
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,610
But nobody believed him.

109
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,700
Until he died, they called him a liar.

110
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,290
But my father never lied.

111
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,425
I'm building a real plane.

112
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:55,790
I'm going to find Laputa!

113
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,810
A real automobile... they're rare.

114
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,810
They're pirates!

115
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,650
They attacked the airship.

116
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,575
- Are they after you?

117
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,520
- Yes.

118
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,650
Quick!

119
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,120
Morning!

120
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,580
Hey, wait!

121
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,085
What?

122
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:28,910
We're in a rush.

123
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,380
Have you seen a girl?

124
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,680
Sure, yesterday...

125
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,370
The boss's kid, Madge...

126
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,630
Off you go!

127
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,890
They're indeed looking for you.

128
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,850
Louis, a girl's dress!

129
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,147
What!

130
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,454
She was disguised!

131
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:49,761
Tell Mama!

132
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,440
Haven't seen her.

133
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,065
A cute little girl.

134
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:01,700
Brown hair, braids...

135
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,120
Boss!

136
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,990
Boss!

137
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,580
About that age.

138
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,420
That's her!

139
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,575
Pirates!

140
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:21,830
They're chasing her.

141
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,335
Pirates!

142
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:27,670
Lemme see!

143
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,270
Not one step closer.

144
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,375
- Hand her over.

145
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:34,550
- Pirates, eh?

146
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,730
Dola's clan.

147
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,220
Go home.

148
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,720
Just poor folk here.

149
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,610
Ma'am?

150
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,880
Scoot out the back.

151
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,450
I want to fight.

152
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,160
They've got weapons!

153
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,740
But...!

154
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,960
What a pretty girl.

155
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,900
Better protect her.

156
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,380
You refuse to step aside?

157
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,370
Use your fists.

158
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,370
Like a man.

159
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,000
Could be interesting.

160
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,800
Get him, brother.

161
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,230
Show your stuff.

162
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,990
Wow.

163
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,830
Who's going to mend that shirt?

164
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,890
You can beat him!

165
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,770
That's it, hit him!

166
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,475
Think you can fool me?

167
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:28,080
After them!

168
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,930
Yes!

169
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,190
Climb on!

170
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,690
There you go.

171
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,770
Playing hooky for a date?

172
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,320
Bad guys are after us.

173
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,870
The Dola clan.

174
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,450
Pirates?

175
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,485
Take us to the next town.

176
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:56,530
To the police!

177
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,560
You're on.

178
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,590
Stoke the fire.

179
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,520
Right!

180
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,720
Mama!

181
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,625
You idiots!

182
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:13,050
Hurry up and get on!

183
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,300
What?

184
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,550
But the girl's...

185
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,440
Get moving!

186
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,860
Brother!

187
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,860
Wait!

188
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,680
They're catching up, more steam!

189
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,430
Can't you go any faster?

190
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,720
She's an old-timer.

191
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,520
Move over!

192
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,660
Mama, I can't hang on!

193
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,130
More steam, they're gaining on us!

194
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,290
Here we go!

195
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,260
Sheeta, over here.

196
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,600
Stoke the fire.

197
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,780
Don't give up!

198
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,915
Push!

199
00:24:00,935 --> 00:24:02,070
Push, I tell you!

200
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,160
Not so fast!

201
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,915
Don't let them escape!

202
00:24:21,935 --> 00:24:24,160
Dump this over the side!

203
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,340
That'll teach them!

204
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,070
I'll do it.

205
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,440
No, let me.

206
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,850
Wait!

207
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,465
It's them.

208
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:45,410
What'll we do?

209
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,640
I refuse to give up.

210
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,870
Move!

211
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,385
This is a surprise.

212
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:06,140
If it isn't the army.

213
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,475
These kids need help!

214
00:25:14,495 --> 00:25:17,230
They've got pirates after them.

215
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,210
Sheeta?

216
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,070
Goodbye.

217
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,550
Wait!

218
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,800
Sheeta!

219
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,010
Halt or l'll shoot.

220
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,140
An armored train.

221
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:46,965
Who cares!

222
00:25:46,985 --> 00:25:47,800
Ram it!

223
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,270
What is it, Sheeta!

224
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,030
Stay away!

225
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,530
They're gonna fall!

226
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,810
Quiet.

227
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,100
Watch closely.

228
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,310
We're floating!

229
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,470
Look!

230
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,720
It's that crystal!

231
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,830
It was the stone after all!

232
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,690
Amazing!

233
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,260
We'll float all the way down.

234
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,750
Amazing!

235
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,800
I want it!

236
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,310
Fire!

237
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,820
I have to get that amazing stone!

238
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,130
It's fading...

239
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,510
Hey, wait!

240
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,810
It's just like when you landed.

241
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,190
The opening looks so tiny.

242
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,740
I hope the Boss and the engineer aren't in any trouble.

243
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,315
Aw, don't worry.

244
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:47,900
Miners aren't exactly wimps.

245
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,450
Come on, let's find the way out.

246
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,210
These mines are ancient.

247
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,320
Tunnels everywhere.

248
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,600
There.

249
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,935
I'm so happy.

250
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:15,590
I was starving.

251
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,770
I've still got an apple and some candy.

252
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,860
It's like you have a magical bag that holds everything.

253
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,275
Gondoa?

254
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:40,910
That's so far north.

255
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:44,665
Yes.

256
00:29:44,685 --> 00:29:48,420
Both my parents died, but they left me the house and the fields, so I was getting by alone.

257
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,040
The guys with dark glasses kidnapped you?

258
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,980
Yes.

259
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,000
That guy was one of them?

260
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,130
Who can they be, calling in the army?

261
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,210
Dola and the other guys, they all want the stone.

262
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,840
But I had no idea it had mysterious powers.

263
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:32,955
It was always in our family.

264
00:30:32,975 --> 00:30:35,880
Mother left it to me when she died.

265
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,480
She warned me never to show it or give it to anyone.

266
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,780
We're both orphans, aren't we?

267
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,360
I'm sorry I dragged you into all of this.

268
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,200
When you fell from the sky my heart was racing.

269
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,730
I knew something wonderful had begun.

270
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,800
Little demons... little demons.

271
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,007
Uncle Pom!

272
00:31:13,027 --> 00:31:13,944
It's OK.

273
00:31:13,964 --> 00:31:14,881
He's really great.

274
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,060
Uncle Pom.

275
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,250
We've lost our way.

276
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,860
Now that little demon sure looks like Pazu...

277
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,320
With a little girl demon beside him.

278
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,570
Pirates are after us.

279
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,930
And the army.

280
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,580
How very extraordinary.

281
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,170
Drink up.

282
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,470
Thank you.

283
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:54,010
Have you always lived underground?

284
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,240
Why no, no.

285
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,030
The rocks have been stirring...

286
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,110
That's when I like to be down here.

287
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,560
The rocks were stirring...?

288
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,910
Rocks speak very softly.

289
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,030
Wonderful...

290
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,530
Pazu, look at that!

291
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,030
They were ordinary rocks until...

292
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,170
How pretty...

293
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:16,200
Here, let me show you.

294
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,980
It's gone.

295
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,860
These rocks contain Volucite.

296
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,150
Volucite?

297
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,660
As soon as it's exposed to the air, it becomes ordinary stone.

298
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,210
It's glowing...

299
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,670
Oh, my gracious!

300
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,950
That's a Volucite crystal, my dear.

301
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,760
I've never seen one before.

302
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,930
That's why the rocks were stirring.

303
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,560
This stone has mysterious powers.

304
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,270
I thought only Laputans knew how to make Volucite crystals.

305
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,360
Laputans...?

306
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,330
They used Volucite to send a magnificent island aloft...

307
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,445
Laputa did exist, Sheeta!

308
00:34:19,465 --> 00:34:21,570
It really did!

309
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,080
Does the island still exist?

310
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,080
Uncle Pom?

311
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,090
Dear, would you mind covering the stone?

312
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,580
Its power overwhelms me.

313
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,790
What's wrong?

314
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,400
My grandfather told me...

315
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,610
that the rocks stir when Laputa floats overhead.

316
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,320
If you went up to the sky then, you'd find Laputa!

317
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,030
Sheeta, my father was telling the truth!

318
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,370
Young lady...

319
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,450
Well...

320
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,470
Yes?

321
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,030
Your stone is most powerful...

322
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:19,120
I know it as one who has spoken to rocks all my life.

323
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:25,890
A stone so powerful brings happiness, but it also often brings misery.

324
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:31,510
What's more, your stone is the work of men.

325
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,060
How on earth did you...?

326
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,820
The stone's not dangerous!

327
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,070
It already saved Sheeta twice!

328
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,200
Amazing!

329
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,060
Laputa really does exist!

330
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,210
It's gone.

331
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,340
Let's go back to the ship.

332
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,550
When it's this quiet, it's best to stay put.

333
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,840
I'm hungry...

334
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,580
It's all clear.

335
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,630
Let's go.

336
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,850
Thank you, Uncle.

337
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,940
Look after yourselves.

338
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,920
Look at those clouds!

339
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,980
Beyond those clouds is an island we've only dreamed of.

340
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,550
Here I come!

341
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,350
I know I'm going to find Laputa!

342
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,400
Pazu...

343
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,400
I haven't told you everything.

344
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:09,660
My family had a mysterious, ancient name...

345
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,040
that came with this stone.

346
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:17,790
My name is Lucita, Lucita Toelle Ur....

347
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,610
Laputa.

348
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,590
Laputa?

349
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,840
So you mean...

350
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,110
It's the army!

351
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,110
Run!

352
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,520
Underground!

353
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,230
Don't move!

354
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,800
How dare you!

355
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:42,840
Pazu!

356
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,930
Let me go!

357
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,845
Pazu!

358
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:47,560
Pazu!

359
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,290
We've apprehended them.

360
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,370
Good work.

361
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,160
Open up, open up!

362
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,620
Sheeta...

363
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,700
Company, march!

364
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,160
Use force!

365
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,220
Squeeze the brat, she'll talk.

366
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,170
Spoken like a man in uniform.

367
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,920
In your haste, you risk everything.

368
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:30,680
If we'd mobilized sooner, we'd have bagged Dola too.

369
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,470
She managed to decipher your third-rate code.

370
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,720
What!

371
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,270
My organization will handle this.

372
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,730
Concentrate on mobilizing the troops when the time is ripe.

373
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,115
Muska!

374
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:49,020
Remember, I command the search for Laputa!

375
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,220
Of course.

376
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,690
But I have my orders from the government.

377
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,460
That pencil-pushing upstart!

378
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,060
Have a nice rest?

379
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,855
Where's Pazu?

380
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:22,090
Let me see him!

381
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,900
No interest in pretty clothes?

382
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,960
Don't fret about Pazu.

383
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,460
His stubborn head is harder than mine.

384
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,650
Come, I have something to show you.

385
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,630
Enter.

386
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,180
What is it?

387
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,900
A mechanical soldier with vast destructive power.

388
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,780
Until he fell from the sky, no one believed Laputa was real.

389
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,720
He's not of this earth.

390
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,850
Our science can't even identify...

391
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,810
what material he's made of.

392
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,170
Look...

393
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,640
Don't be afraid.

394
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,900
He's long dead.

395
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,610
Look at that.

396
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,250
This insignia was carved on your fireplace.

397
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,170
It's on this stone, too.

398
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,710
The stone works only in your hands.

399
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:22,180
It protects its owner and will guide her back to Laputa.

400
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,180
I know nothing of this!

401
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,820
Take it if you like.

402
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,970
Just leave us alone...

403
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:38,740
Perhaps you imagine that Laputa is some Treasure Island.

404
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,080
Fearsome scientific power thrust Laputa into orbit.

405
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,210
Their dreaded empire once ruled the earth!

406
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:51,960
Even you can appreciate that when such an entity...

407
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,760
roams the skies, it threatens peace.

408
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,760
I need your cooperation.

409
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:04,180
You must know how to make the stone guide us to Laputa.

410
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,705
I really don't know!

411
00:43:06,725 --> 00:43:08,630
Please let me see Pazu!

412
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:15,650
I intend no harm, but his fate rests with you.

413
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,950
The boy goes free if you assist us, Lucita...

414
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,660
Toelle Ur Laputa.

415
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,210
But how...?

416
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,420
Ur means ruler.

417
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,200
Toelle means True.

418
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:37,210
You are Queen Lucita, rightful heir to the Laputan throne.

419
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,400
Out!

420
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,410
Sheeta!

421
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,320
Pazu, are you hurt?

422
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:05,327
I'm fine.

423
00:44:05,347 --> 00:44:06,344
You?

424
00:44:06,364 --> 00:44:07,361
Did they do anything horrible?

425
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,030
My dear Pazu, we misjudged you.

426
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,700
Accept our apologies.

427
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,710
We didn't know how gallantly...

428
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,840
you protected her from the pirates.

429
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,210
Sheeta, what did you...

430
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,180
Pazu, I beg you, forget about Laputa.

431
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,010
What!

432
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:30,140
Sheeta will aid us in our search for Laputa.

433
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,550
I understand how you feel, but forget about her.

434
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,700
Is this true, Sheeta?

435
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,850
But we...

436
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,150
Thank you for everything.

437
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,280
I'll never forget you, Pazu.

438
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,280
I don't believe it...

439
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,860
Sheeta, we promised!

440
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,620
Farewell!

441
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:46,890
Sheeta!

442
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:48,700
Wait, Sheeta!

443
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:49,840
Be reasonable.

444
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,990
Act like a man.

445
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,710
Sheeta!

446
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,955
Here's a token of our gratitude.

447
00:45:03,975 --> 00:45:06,290
It's yours.

448
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:48,050
Only you can recall the words that will waken this stone.

449
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:51,680
If you keep your promise, you, too, shall be free.

450
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,630
Pazu...

451
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,670
Mama, it's Pazu!

452
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:22,700
He's back!

453
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,760
Pazu.

454
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,390
We were so worried.

455
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,960
You just disappeared.

456
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,140
And the girl?

457
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,600
Forget it.

458
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,690
Pazu!

459
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,040
Let me go!

460
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,050
What are you doing!

461
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,560
Put a lid on it!

462
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,320
Nice place you got, kid.

463
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,380
Get out!

464
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,860
This is my house!

465
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,150
Oh, come off it.

466
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,490
Can't even protect a little girl...

467
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:30,570
What?

468
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:32,160
He's got gold!

469
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:35,450
Sold her for money, huh?

470
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,465
No!

471
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:37,490
I wouldn't do that!

472
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,330
You let them pay you off?

473
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,170
Sheeta told me to do it.

474
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,210
So...

475
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,300
So you gave in and crawled home.

476
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,550
You call yourself a man?

477
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,560
You talk big, but you're after Sheeta too.

478
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:59,195
But of course, we're pirates.

479
00:47:59,215 --> 00:48:01,550
Pirates hunt for treasure.

480
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,550
Those guys are strange ones.

481
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,760
What's the girl to them?

482
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,570
You think she'll get out alive?

483
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,040
So, Sheeta told you to leave?

484
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,590
They threatened her, so she tried to save you.

485
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,050
How do you know, Mama?

486
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,840
I've been a woman for 50 years.

487
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,875
She steels her heart to save her man.

488
00:48:32,895 --> 00:48:34,920
How touching.

489
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:37,600
Reminds me of my youth.

490
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:41,560
You boys want to marry, look for one like her.

491
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,325
- So that girl will grow up...

492
00:48:44,345 --> 00:48:45,600
- To be like Mama?

493
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,070
What a waste.

494
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,160
I've got all your codes.

495
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,460
Calling the battle cruiser...?

496
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:13,575
They'll pack her up and take off?

497
00:49:13,595 --> 00:49:15,500
We better hurry!

498
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,940
Dinner's over.

499
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,960
Move out.

500
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,680
Yes, Mama.

501
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,600
Going after Sheeta?

502
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,100
We want the crystal, not the girl.

503
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,770
The stone's no good without her.

504
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,780
Can't I go with you?

505
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,780
I have to help Sheeta!

506
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,780
Do it on your own, like a man.

507
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:43,290
You're right, if I was clever and strong, I could've defended her.

508
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,460
Please, I don't care about treasure.

509
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,400
Listen to him...

510
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,620
Shut up!

511
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,750
Right...

512
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:59,600
He could probably help us with her...

513
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,370
You'll be an outcast forever.

514
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,100
I know.

515
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,600
You sure?

516
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,230
Yup!

517
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,230
Be ready in 40 seconds.

518
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,830
Take care, you guys.

519
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:30,700
Tie this to your belt.

520
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,410
You boys wait on the ship.

521
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:06,695
A magnificent vessel.

522
00:51:06,715 --> 00:51:08,860
Has the girl talked?

523
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,330
I need a little more time.

524
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,550
Forget it!

525
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,330
We'll squeeze it out of her up there.

526
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,550
We depart at dawn, with the girl.

527
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:40,070
Step on it, it's almost dawn!

528
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:47,080
Sheeta!

529
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,840
Whatever shall we do?

530
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:20,980
Sheeta, listen, I'm going to teach you...

531
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,490
a magic spell for trouble.

532
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:24,570
A magic spell?

533
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,295
Yes.

534
00:52:26,315 --> 00:52:28,030
These are old, old, old, secret words.

535
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:42,760
They mean "help me rekindle the light."

536
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,240
Perfect.

537
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:30,295
Just as the ancient books described.

538
00:53:30,315 --> 00:53:32,420
This is the sacred light.

539
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,560
Sacred light...?

540
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:40,985
What are the magic words?

541
00:53:41,005 --> 00:53:42,600
Tell me.

542
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,840
It's moving!

543
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:12,560
The robot, it's alive!

544
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:14,460
Hello!

545
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:29,490
Help!

546
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,980
It's alive!

547
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,320
It's the robot!

548
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,990
The robot?

549
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,810
It's coming this way.

550
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,150
Hurry!

551
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,410
Retreat!

552
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,480
Retreat!

553
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:18,790
Incredible!

554
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,420
I see!

555
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,430
It's the light!

556
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,930
The sacred light broke his seal!

557
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:36,770
The way to Laputa is open!

558
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:38,010
Come!

559
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:38,930
No!

560
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:01,000
It can fly!

561
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:55,220
It's pointing to the sky...

562
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:02,640
It's showing the way to Laputa.

563
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,150
Hurry!

564
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,347
Explosives?

565
00:57:06,367 --> 00:57:07,554
Idiot!

566
00:57:07,574 --> 00:57:08,761
You'll blow up the fortress!

567
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:11,905
Hello, hello!

568
00:57:11,925 --> 00:57:13,020
What is this!

569
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:14,740
Good.

570
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,030
We're connected.

571
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:18,455
This is Colonel Muska.

572
00:57:18,475 --> 00:57:20,280
The robot cut communication with the ship.

573
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:23,790
I've assumed emergency command.

574
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,750
It's after the girl on the tower.

575
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,840
Take it down on sight.

576
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,575
Prepare to fire.

577
00:57:30,595 --> 00:57:32,320
Just don't hit the girl.

578
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:38,680
Hurry!

579
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,710
Hurry up!

580
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:01,620
Fire!

581
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:20,800
Hurry!

582
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,785
We did it.

583
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:25,870
Awesome!

584
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,230
Get the girl.

585
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,770
Is she dead?

586
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:34,030
Get up!

587
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,050
She just fainted.

588
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,360
Stand!

589
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:41,910
It moved...

590
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,375
What's that?

591
00:59:32,395 --> 00:59:33,510
Looks like a war.

592
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,640
Let's go, granny!

593
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,710
That's Captain, to you!

594
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,390
Lower, Charles.

595
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,350
Stop!

596
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:05,400
Stop it!

597
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:06,910
Please!

598
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,460
Mama, Goliath's pushing off!

599
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:27,055
We're going directly into the crossfire.

600
01:00:27,075 --> 01:00:28,960
Regroup!

601
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:30,600
Look, there's Sheeta!

602
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,060
What?

603
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:34,350
Where?

604
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:38,110
Straight ahead, she's on top of that tower!

605
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:47,935
This is a job for a woman!

606
01:00:47,955 --> 01:00:49,860
Cover me.

607
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:03,430
Sheeta!

608
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,260
I'm coming, Sheeta!

609
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,970
Pazu!

610
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,810
Fly closer!

611
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:17,810
Pazu!

612
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,860
Let me go!

613
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:42,570
Sheeta!

614
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,550
Granny!

615
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,080
Pazu!

616
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:04,740
Pazu!

617
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,340
Pull up!

618
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:34,090
Last chance!

619
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:35,590
Grab her on the fly!

620
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:38,520
Pazu!

621
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,060
Here goes!

622
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,800
Move aside!

623
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,610
Damn!

624
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,690
Sheeta!

625
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:54,120
What's Goliath doing?

626
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,540
A smoke screen...?

627
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:17,770
Where's the robot?

628
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:18,855
Destroyed.

629
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:19,950
The girl went that way.

630
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,810
What!

631
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,220
Put out the fire!

632
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,940
Organize a search party!

633
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,670
We haven't lost the sacred stone.

634
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,720
Its light points to Laputa...

635
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:56,470
Inform the General, we'll depart for Laputa as planned.

636
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:35,760
He's lucky...

637
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:40,270
I can't believe she'll grow up to be just like Mama...

638
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:47,010
There's your valley...

639
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:48,770
Right back where we started.

640
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,150
Granny, please take us aboard.

641
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,890
Call me Captain!

642
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:58,360
What use are you without the crystal?

643
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:00,160
We'll work.

644
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,330
I want to see Laputa for myself.

645
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:14,340
Don't want any treasure, just want to see Laputa?

646
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:17,100
Suspect motives for boarding a pirate ship.

647
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:19,640
Are they coming with us, Mama?

648
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:22,460
One false move and you're shark bait!

649
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,880
Excellent!

650
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,640
No more laundry or cleaning duty!

651
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:28,300
Or dish washing!

652
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,230
Or potato peeling!

653
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:37,490
Can you make pudding?

654
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:38,450
Yes...

655
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:40,540
I like mincemeat pie.

656
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:44,540
I eat, uhm... anything!

657
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,460
Enough out of you!

658
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:49,290
When will those boys ever grow up?

659
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:37,200
Get off!

660
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:42,185
Cloth.

661
01:06:42,205 --> 01:06:43,340
It's made of cloth.

662
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:45,020
And don't tear it.

663
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:48,650
Hurry up, it's crowded in here!

664
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,530
Hurry, this way!

665
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:59,030
I hate dawdlers.

666
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:01,160
You're with me!

667
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,370
Pazu!

668
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:03,195
I don't bite.

669
01:07:03,215 --> 01:07:04,030
Come.

670
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,500
You're not here for fun.

671
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,880
What an engine.

672
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:15,343
Now where'd he go?

673
01:07:15,363 --> 01:07:16,816
Pops!

674
01:07:16,836 --> 01:07:18,289
Pops!

675
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:22,470
Look, we got you an assistant.

676
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,335
Don't holler.

677
01:07:25,355 --> 01:07:27,260
I hear you.

678
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:31,730
He's tougher than Mama.

679
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,050
Be careful.

680
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,600
My hand doesn't fit.

681
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:43,740
This gasket?

682
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,660
Name?

683
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,410
Pazu.

684
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,830
The crystal pointed nearly due east...

685
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:53,630
You sure about that?

686
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,720
I could see the sunrise from the tower.

687
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:59,210
It's the harvest season now...

688
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:03,390
so the sun rises just south of due east.

689
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:06,510
The light pointed to the left of where the sun rose.

690
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,735
Good answer.

691
01:08:07,755 --> 01:08:08,970
Any luck?

692
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,640
Not a peep.

693
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,440
Maintaining radio silence, are they?

694
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:16,015
Mama, Goliath's faster.

695
01:08:16,035 --> 01:08:17,600
What do we do?

696
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:20,965
We're upwind of them.

697
01:08:20,985 --> 01:08:23,970
If we get a lift on the trade winds...

698
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:26,620
My Far East-style calculator.

699
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:29,290
Windspeed is 10... and...

700
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,620
I think we can catch them.

701
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:35,920
OK, listen up!

702
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:39,115
Goliath's on its way to Laputa.

703
01:08:39,135 --> 01:08:41,920
We're on their tail.

704
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:45,140
With these winds, I expect contact tomorrow.

705
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:49,310
Ten gold pieces to whoever spots her first!

706
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:50,140
Ten!

707
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:55,980
Whatever we find, I'm sure Laputa has riches enough for any pirate gang!

708
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,980
Earn your keep, boys!

709
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,410
Now!

710
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:18,590
Course 98, speed 40.

711
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:52,160
That get-up of yours won't work.

712
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,160
Wear these.

713
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,050
Your station.

714
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:11,810
Beautiful...

715
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:20,425
You serve five meals a day.

716
01:10:20,445 --> 01:10:22,770
Go easy on the water.

717
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:33,200
Get to work, you idiots!

718
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:25,820
Yes?

719
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:33,510
I'm sorry, dinner isn't ready yet.

720
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:36,560
I've never cooked on an airship...

721
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,560
Do you need something?

722
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:42,400
Beautiful...

723
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:48,240
I thought I'd give you a hand in my spare time.

724
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:50,270
Why thank you.

725
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:52,310
Can you put those dishes away?

726
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,080
Happy to obli...

727
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,330
You said your stomach hurt...

728
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:01,500
I've got some free time.

729
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,680
Can I...

730
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:05,840
You're in the way.

731
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,490
Some stomach ache, jerk!

732
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,380
Hey, can I help...

733
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:23,460
You've changed, chasing the likes of Goliath...

734
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:26,880
But it's pointless.

735
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:29,820
It's Laputan treasure I'm after.

736
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,570
They're certainly nice kids...

737
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:35,870
Get to the point, you old goat.

738
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:40,410
They're too upright and honest to ever respect you.

739
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:41,540
What's that!

740
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:43,075
No, I mean...

741
01:12:43,095 --> 01:12:44,620
Check...

742
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:48,380
Excellent... delicious...

743
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:54,390
Seconds anyone?

744
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:54,890
Yes?

745
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:55,490
Seconds!

746
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:56,100
Seconds!

747
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:56,710
Seconds!

748
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:17,160
Hey, shake a leg.

749
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,610
It's your watch.

750
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:23,960
Take it, it's cold.

751
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:24,960
Watch?

752
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:25,710
Yeah.

753
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:32,595
Darn cold!

754
01:13:32,615 --> 01:13:33,790
Go on up.

755
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,510
My turn.

756
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:44,230
Great.

757
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,320
Sheeta!

758
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,820
That was scary!

759
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,880
It's beautiful.

760
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:20,265
Sheeta.

761
01:14:20,285 --> 01:14:21,210
Get in.

762
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,730
Can't you sleep?

763
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:29,840
Nice and warm...

764
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,440
Look aft.

765
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,490
Pazu?

766
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:40,780
I'm really scared.

767
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:44,700
I really don't want to go to Laputa.

768
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,960
I hope we never find Goliath.

769
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:48,830
You mean...?

770
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,240
No, the light showed the right way.

771
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,660
But...

772
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,380
You mean the robot?

773
01:14:58,370 --> 01:14:59,840
Poor thing.

774
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:05,930
I never dreamed that little spell would work.

775
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:10,730
I learned lots of other spells.

776
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:13,305
To help find things, cure the sick.

777
01:15:13,325 --> 01:15:15,890
And one I must never, ever use.

778
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,570
Never, ever use...?

779
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:19,410
A spell of destruction.

780
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:25,830
I had to learn bad ones so the good spells had power.

781
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,830
I was so scared, I couldn't sleep.

782
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:32,840
That stone should be locked away.

783
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,865
They hid it in the fireplace.

784
01:15:35,885 --> 01:15:38,330
It was only worn for weddings.

785
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:43,760
My mother's and grandmother's and great grandmother's.

786
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:47,180
I should have thrown it away.

787
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:49,340
You're wrong.

788
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,510
We met because of the stone.

789
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:55,440
Throwing it away won't make Laputa disappear.

790
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,600
Airships are improving.

791
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,770
Someone will find it.

792
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:05,790
I don't know what to do, but if Laputa is so dangerous...

793
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:08,790
it's not for the likes of Muska.

794
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:10,080
Besides...

795
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:14,380
If we run now, they'll hunt us forever.

796
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:17,050
But don't become a pirate for me.

797
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19,760
I won't become a pirate.

798
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,265
Dola understands.

799
01:16:22,285 --> 01:16:24,250
She's nicer than she looks.

800
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:28,270
Once things are settled, I'll take you to Gondoa.

801
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:33,270
I want to see where you were born, the valley, the yaks...

802
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:35,770
Pazu...

803
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:38,780
What's that!

804
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:41,070
Below us, look!

805
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,870
Goliath, right below us!

806
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:56,950
Come about!

807
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:57,870
Full rudder!

808
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,015
We should go after them.

809
01:17:30,035 --> 01:17:31,690
They'll be trouble if we don't!

810
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,870
We can't catch them in these clouds.

811
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:35,965
We'll get them.

812
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,410
They won't go far.

813
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:40,420
Steady as she goes.

814
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,330
We're farther north than I thought.

815
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:56,335
Pazu, listen up!

816
01:17:56,355 --> 01:17:57,350
Time's running out.

817
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:59,655
If we lose Goliath, it's all over.

818
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,310
Your eyes are sharp.

819
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,690
Track them from the crow's nest.

820
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:04,700
What do I do?

821
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:06,440
That lookout post is a glider.

822
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:08,190
See the crank?

823
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,410
Yeah.

824
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:10,910
Turn it clockwise.

825
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:18,210
Once it's locked, the upper lever unfolds the wings.

826
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:24,595
Use the wire to stabilize them.

827
01:18:24,615 --> 01:18:26,460
Figure out how to steer as you go!

828
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:28,080
- Sheeta, you there?

829
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:29,090
- Yes.

830
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,930
Get back down here.

831
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:32,220
Why?

832
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:34,230
Because you're a girl!

833
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:37,075
But so are you!

834
01:18:37,095 --> 01:18:39,240
Besides, I'm a mountain girl with sharp eyes.

835
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:40,320
Sheeta!

836
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:41,390
Please.

837
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:42,470
Pazu agrees.

838
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:47,990
Once you're aloft, the voice tube won't work.

839
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:50,060
See the head set?

840
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,490
You mean this, right?

841
01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:54,790
Wow...

842
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:55,993
OK.

843
01:18:56,013 --> 01:18:56,886
I'll give it a try.

844
01:18:56,906 --> 01:18:57,779
Release us.

845
01:18:58,110 --> 01:18:59,580
Here goes.

846
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,730
They're gone.

847
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:22,310
Slipped into the clouds.

848
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:24,050
Look sharp!

849
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:25,310
They could be anywhere.

850
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:26,900
Aye!

851
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,070
Hold on tight.

852
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,710
What's wrong!

853
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:40,880
We're fine!

854
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,380
Just ran into a gust of wind.

855
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:46,340
We're keeping watch.

856
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:47,920
Scared?

857
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,090
No.

858
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,180
I'm getting the hang of it.

859
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,880
Rough skies ahead.

860
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:59,020
Sheeta, get the rope from my bag.

861
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,730
Tie yourself to me.

862
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:09,270
The mercury's dropping, Mama...

863
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,597
Lousy luck.

864
01:20:10,617 --> 01:20:11,934
Storm coming up...

865
01:20:11,954 --> 01:20:13,271
How long 'til dawn?

866
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,660
One more hour.

867
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,430
It's dawn.

868
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:36,350
Strange that the sun's rising on that side...

869
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,660
I know!

870
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:38,980
We're supposed to be heading east.

871
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,300
Bridge!

872
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,595
What!

873
01:20:41,615 --> 01:20:42,890
We're heading north?

874
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,940
The compass is pointing east.

875
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:48,570
The shifting winds must have put us off course.

876
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:49,610
Look!

877
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:50,705
What is it?

878
01:20:50,725 --> 01:20:51,810
Goliath?

879
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:53,165
It's a cloud.

880
01:20:53,185 --> 01:20:54,520
A huge one...

881
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:56,330
A cloud?

882
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:58,450
It's headed for us!

883
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:13,550
A castle in the sky...

884
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:16,960
We're headed into a low pressure system.

885
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,560
Turn her away, full speed!

886
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:39,830
It's sucking us in.

887
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:41,620
Hold tight, we can't help!

888
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:50,540
The helm won't move!

889
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:53,110
Where's your brute strength?

890
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:53,760
Hey!

891
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,760
Engine's burning up!

892
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:59,470
Stop whining and figure something out!

893
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,020
We're clearing the clouds!

894
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,360
Sheeta, the ocean!

895
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:24,540
The Dragon's Lair!

896
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:27,040
So this is the Dragon's Lair...

897
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:39,350
Just as Dad said.

898
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:41,050
The wind's blowing the other way.

899
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,980
Look out, a wall of wind!

900
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:49,180
Mama!

901
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,390
It's sucking us in!

902
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:51,640
Don't give up!

903
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:52,890
Be a man!

904
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:54,080
Bridge!

905
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:55,270
It's Laputa!

906
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,570
What was that!

907
01:22:56,850 --> 01:23:00,070
Dad saw Laputa inside the Dragon's Lair.

908
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:01,910
Don't be ridiculous!

909
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:03,480
It'll tear you to pieces!

910
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:04,580
Pazu!

911
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:05,830
Look.

912
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:10,960
Just what we need.

913
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:23,963
Let's go for it!

914
01:23:23,983 --> 01:23:25,466
Dad did it.

915
01:23:25,486 --> 01:23:26,969
He made it back.

916
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:29,270
All right, into the Dragon's Lair!

917
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:44,450
Got 'em!

918
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:46,015
Our ship's in danger.

919
01:23:46,035 --> 01:23:47,190
We must withdraw.

920
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,400
Stay on course.

921
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,900
The light's pointing right into the cloud.

922
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,840
Laputa's in there.

923
01:23:56,850 --> 01:23:58,520
Stay on course.

924
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:00,210
We'll find a way in.

925
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:14,020
Here we go, Sheeta!

926
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,610
Sheeta, Sheeta!

927
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:16,360
Are you all right?

928
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:23,210
Look...

929
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:38,730
Laputa...?

930
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:42,110
Oops.

931
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:44,715
Wait...

932
01:27:44,735 --> 01:27:46,310
I tied it really tight.

933
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,410
My hands are shaking...

934
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:11,840
We did it!

935
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:32,570
Birds...

936
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,700
Where is everyone?

937
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:48,090
Coming to greet you?

938
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:50,510
But I don't have the stone.

939
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:52,050
I'll cut the rope.

940
01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:13,080
What are you doing!

941
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:14,350
Wait.

942
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:16,310
Please don't break that.

943
01:29:16,330 --> 01:29:18,280
We need it to get home.

944
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,550
A flycatcher's nest!

945
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:38,100
That's why he's here?

946
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:45,275
See?

947
01:29:45,295 --> 01:29:46,850
All your eggs are fine.

948
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,230
The birds aren't afraid.

949
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,200
It says to follow.

950
01:29:57,210 --> 01:29:58,255
- You understand it?

951
01:29:58,275 --> 01:29:59,320
- Just intuition.

952
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:25,480
It's a city...

953
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:55,720
What an amazing place...

954
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:16,150
You can see the sky!{} If their science was so advanced, what happened?

955
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:15,880
It's a grave.

956
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:17,700
I wish I could read the writing.

957
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,720
Someone left flowers.

958
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:27,930
Do you put these here?

959
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:30,210
Pazu!

960
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:31,440
It's a different robot!

961
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,360
It must've broken down long ago...

962
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:54,380
Probably a gardener robot.

963
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:59,420
It protected this place even after the people went away.

964
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,900
You picked flowers for the grave?

965
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:20,780
Thank you.

966
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:25,325
Are you all alone?

967
01:33:25,345 --> 01:33:27,690
Are there any other robots here?

968
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:56,020
He doesn't seem to be lonely.

969
01:33:56,300 --> 01:34:00,650
He's got friends and birds' nests to look after...

970
01:34:17,030 --> 01:34:18,210
This way!

971
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,640
This section's been destroyed.

972
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:53,120
They got the Tiger Moth.

973
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,250
I hope the pirates are OK.

974
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:59,070
Sheeta, look there!

975
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:01,590
They're prisoners!

976
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:04,010
They hang pirates.

977
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:05,130
We must help them.

978
01:35:05,130 --> 01:35:06,240
Let's go!

979
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,560
We found a way in.

980
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,340
Look at this, mountains of treasure.

981
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:21,400
Wow...

982
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:24,400
Want some?

983
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,530
I'll give you plenty of rope.

984
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:30,240
Have you reported that we found Laputa?

985
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:31,160
Just about to.

986
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:34,600
Make the code good and complicated.

987
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:36,395
Hey!

988
01:35:36,415 --> 01:35:38,200
No looting!

989
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,960
The perfect distraction for those idiots.

990
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,770
What amazing roots.

991
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:02,480
You can climb trees, can't you?

992
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:06,320
I see a way.

993
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:41,640
No better than thieves.

994
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:44,650
If they reach the garden...!

995
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,030
Sheeta, let's find the stone!

996
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:52,450
It's the only way to stop them.

997
01:36:52,450 --> 01:36:54,530
I was wondering why the clouds parted.

998
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:58,540
It was so they could land.

999
01:36:59,310 --> 01:37:01,500
Was it my spell...?

1000
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:03,260
Muska was right.

1001
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,030
The seal's broken.

1002
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:08,380
The kingdom's waking up.

1003
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:11,550
It's welcomed the visitor with the stone.

1004
01:37:12,370 --> 01:37:14,550
But Muska will become king.

1005
01:37:15,370 --> 01:37:17,850
He's got much worse in mind.

1006
01:37:17,850 --> 01:37:22,310
But what do I do when I get the stone back...

1007
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:24,100
That spell!

1008
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:28,550
You mean... the destruction spell?

1009
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,510
Down and around.

1010
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:16,910
I'll go first.

1011
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,680
It's here somewhere.

1012
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:49,400
Please God...

1013
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:56,490
This is it!

1014
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,500
It's that kid.

1015
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:12,920
No!

1016
01:39:13,630 --> 01:39:14,220
Don't shoot!

1017
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:14,830
Capture her.

1018
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:19,680
Well, if it isn't the little princess.

1019
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:20,915
Sheeta!

1020
01:39:20,935 --> 01:39:21,880
Damn!

1021
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,060
What is it, Colonel?

1022
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:28,670
The last of the pirates.

1023
01:39:28,690 --> 01:39:30,550
There's one right under you.

1024
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,820
Yes sir!

1025
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,450
Sheeta, wait for me!

1026
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:39,780
Pazu!

1027
01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:43,990
Grenades!

1028
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,000
Is that Pazu?

1029
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:51,250
What was that?

1030
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,050
No, it wasn't.

1031
01:40:01,970 --> 01:40:04,210
The General is over there.

1032
01:40:04,210 --> 01:40:07,600
Militia, fall in on the double.

1033
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:14,730
Granny!

1034
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:17,240
They've got Sheeta.

1035
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:18,855
I'm going after her.

1036
01:40:18,875 --> 01:40:20,480
I'll cut your ropes.

1037
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:30,750
Get out of here.

1038
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:32,500
Hey, wait!

1039
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:36,380
Take this.

1040
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:39,080
Thanks.

1041
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:44,260
The boy has become a man.

1042
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:45,640
What?!

1043
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:49,140
Muska destroyed all the radio equipment?

1044
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:52,150
Yes, while the ship was lightly guarded.

1045
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:55,110
Several guards are badly wounded.

1046
01:40:55,110 --> 01:40:57,400
The Colonel entered the inner palace with the girl.

1047
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,490
The soldiers saw him.

1048
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:03,410
That upstart's finally showing his colors.

1049
01:41:03,410 --> 01:41:05,410
Hunt him down and arrest him!

1050
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:06,860
All units!

1051
01:41:06,870 --> 01:41:07,625
Hey!

1052
01:41:07,645 --> 01:41:08,400
Hurry!

1053
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:11,250
Shoot if he resists!

1054
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:13,370
Find the entrance.

1055
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:37,400
Where are we, Colonel?

1056
01:41:37,410 --> 01:41:39,265
Laputa's core.

1057
01:41:39,285 --> 01:41:41,140
The castle above is just a trifle.

1058
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:46,160
All of Laputa's knowledge is crystallized here.

1059
01:41:51,650 --> 01:41:53,330
You two wait here.

1060
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:54,670
Colonel!

1061
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:58,670
Only royalty may enter the sacred area.

1062
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:02,920
What is this!

1063
01:42:05,790 --> 01:42:08,180
The roots have invaded...

1064
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:13,800
Eventually, we'll burn them all.

1065
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:15,190
Come, this way.

1066
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:27,910
Confound it...

1067
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:29,370
Yes...

1068
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:30,870
This is it!

1069
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:40,420
Here, too!

1070
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:46,050
Curse it...

1071
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,770
Found it!

1072
01:43:00,850 --> 01:43:03,800
Behold the giant crystal!

1073
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:06,770
Source of Laputa's power.

1074
01:43:07,070 --> 01:43:09,665
Fantastic.

1075
01:43:09,685 --> 01:43:12,280
It has awaited the king's return for 700 years.

1076
01:43:12,290 --> 01:43:13,580
700 years?

1077
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:18,070
Your family forgot even that?

1078
01:43:24,210 --> 01:43:26,280
The black rock!

1079
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,370
As the epics described!

1080
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:35,400
I can read it.

1081
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:36,380
I know what it says!

1082
01:43:38,090 --> 01:43:39,400
Just who are you?

1083
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:46,110
I too have an ancient, secret name, Lucita.

1084
01:43:46,110 --> 01:43:48,910
My name is Romuska Palo Ur Laputa.

1085
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:56,410
We are descended from the same royal family.

1086
01:43:57,230 --> 01:43:59,920
Later it split into two branches.

1087
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:11,550
Not even a crack.

1088
01:44:11,550 --> 01:44:13,050
It's indestructible.

1089
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:15,470
Deploy all our explosives.

1090
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:19,060
Force won't be necessary, Your Excellency.

1091
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:20,560
Muska, where are you!

1092
01:45:13,950 --> 01:45:19,450
What are you waiting for, General?

1093
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:22,800
All right, after me!

1094
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,550
Forward!

1095
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:39,395
What is this!

1096
01:45:39,415 --> 01:45:41,300
Muska, where are you?

1097
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:43,020
Silence!

1098
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:49,610
What on earth!

1099
01:45:51,860 --> 01:45:53,950
Watch your tongue.

1100
01:45:53,970 --> 01:45:56,060
You're in the presence of Laputa's king.

1101
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:58,080
Are you insane?

1102
01:45:58,350 --> 01:46:04,330
Let's celebrate Laputa's return with a demonstration of its power.

1103
01:46:05,070 --> 01:46:05,830
Sheeta!

1104
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:09,840
Behold Laputa's thunder!

1105
01:46:10,410 --> 01:46:11,670
Sheeta.

1106
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:38,070
It's the heavenly fire that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.

1107
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:42,080
It's the Ramayana's Arrow of Indra.

1108
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:46,330
The world shall bow down before Laputa once more!

1109
01:46:47,410 --> 01:46:49,350
Wonderful, Muska.

1110
01:46:49,370 --> 01:46:51,310
You're a hero.

1111
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:53,270
A monumental achievement.

1112
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:03,350
I grow tired of your stupid face.

1113
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:07,560
Run, everyone!

1114
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:09,610
Die!

1115
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,255
- It's those monsters!

1116
01:47:38,275 --> 01:47:39,530
- Look at them...

1117
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:40,640
Run!

1118
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:47,520
Are the Flaptors OK?

1119
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:50,310
Ready to fly!

1120
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:51,690
Let's hurry!

1121
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:53,495
Quiet.

1122
01:47:53,515 --> 01:47:55,310
Keep your voice down.

1123
01:48:01,990 --> 01:48:04,105
What are those two doing?

1124
01:48:04,125 --> 01:48:06,240
I'll have to leave them behind.

1125
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:10,670
I advise you not to anger me.

1126
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:16,460
We'll be alone here for a long time.

1127
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:24,100
They should've escaped.

1128
01:48:28,550 --> 01:48:30,600
You think you can fight me?

1129
01:48:59,080 --> 01:48:59,880
Robots!

1130
01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:38,210
Sheeta!

1131
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:48,350
Fantastic!

1132
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:51,520
A marvelous display, no?

1133
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:56,290
Die, you insects!

1134
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,110
How dare you!

1135
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,430
Damn!

1136
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:15,580
Be a good girl, give it back.

1137
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:19,150
Please, open!

1138
01:50:27,660 --> 01:50:29,720
Just where will you go?

1139
01:50:31,670 --> 01:50:33,270
Open!

1140
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:53,830
Sheeta!

1141
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:23,450
Pazu!

1142
01:51:23,450 --> 01:51:23,980
Sheeta!

1143
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:25,220
I'm coming.

1144
01:51:26,350 --> 01:51:27,700
Get back!

1145
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,650
Take this, hurry!

1146
01:51:29,670 --> 01:51:31,400
Muska's coming, quick!

1147
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:41,170
Throw it into the sea.

1148
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:49,895
Hold onto that stone.

1149
01:51:49,915 --> 01:51:52,170
I'll trade her life for it.

1150
01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:22,300
Get up!

1151
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,830
No more hide and seek.

1152
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:32,640
How delightful that it should end in the throne room.

1153
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:34,840
Come here!

1154
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:37,225
The throne room?

1155
01:52:37,245 --> 01:52:39,340
This will be our grave.

1156
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:44,820
What is a king when his country lies ruined?

1157
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:46,610
I won't give you the stone.

1158
01:52:46,620 --> 01:52:48,495
You'll die, trapped here with me.

1159
01:52:48,515 --> 01:52:50,390
There's no escape.

1160
01:52:51,310 --> 01:52:55,140
This is why Laputa died out.

1161
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:58,480
There's a song in my valley...

1162
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:00,820
Put down your roots in the soil...

1163
01:53:00,830 --> 01:53:02,790
Live together with the wind.

1164
01:53:02,790 --> 01:53:07,420
Pass the winter with the seeds, sing in the spring with the birds...

1165
01:53:07,830 --> 01:53:10,470
Your weapons may be powerful.

1166
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:13,130
Your pitiful robots may be many.

1167
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:15,220
But you can't survive apart from the earth.

1168
01:53:19,850 --> 01:53:21,335
Laputa will not die.

1169
01:53:21,355 --> 01:53:22,840
It will rise again.

1170
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:26,230
Its power is the stuff of humanity's dreams.

1171
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:32,150
Next, I shoot off your ears!

1172
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:34,485
Beg for your life.

1173
01:53:34,505 --> 01:53:36,830
Make the kid hand over the stone.

1174
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:38,870
Wait!

1175
01:53:39,370 --> 01:53:41,380
The stone's hidden.

1176
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:43,410
You can shoot, but you won't get it.

1177
01:53:43,870 --> 01:53:46,170
Stay away, Pazu.

1178
01:53:46,190 --> 01:53:48,490
He'll kill us both.

1179
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:52,720
I'll spare her life if you tell me where the stone is.

1180
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:58,180
Or do you intend to conquer me with that cannon of yours?

1181
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:02,060
Let me talk to Sheeta alone.

1182
01:54:02,070 --> 01:54:03,425
Run away.

1183
01:54:03,445 --> 01:54:04,800
Take the stone and run!

1184
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:08,400
Three minutes.

1185
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:32,720
Sheeta, calm down and listen.

1186
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:35,210
Teach me that spell.

1187
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:38,640
I'll say it with you.

1188
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:41,640
Put your hand in mine.

1189
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:53,650
I cut the pirates' ropes.

1190
01:54:58,440 --> 01:54:59,430
Time's up.

1191
01:54:59,450 --> 01:55:00,440
What do you say?

1192
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:45,440
My eyes!

1193
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:47,240
My eyes!

1194
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,160
I can't see...

1195
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:09,270
Mama, it's collapsing!

1196
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,325
All right, let's go.

1197
01:56:10,345 --> 01:56:11,390
Hurry!

1198
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:12,730
Hurry!

1199
01:56:24,190 --> 01:56:26,910
Look, the bottom's falling out!

1200
01:57:17,410 --> 01:57:20,380
Sheeta was such a nice girl...

1201
01:57:20,590 --> 01:57:23,400
They used the spell of destruction.

1202
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:27,010
Those kids saved Laputa from those idiots.

1203
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:32,060
It's stopping!

1204
01:57:38,230 --> 01:57:39,885
A crystal!

1205
01:57:39,905 --> 01:57:41,560
A humongous one!

1206
01:57:41,570 --> 01:57:43,160
It's rising.

1207
01:57:49,450 --> 01:57:51,565
The tree... it's carrying it away.

1208
01:57:51,585 --> 01:57:53,700
Chase it!

1209
01:57:53,710 --> 01:57:56,050
You're heavy, get off.

1210
01:57:56,050 --> 01:57:57,170
I can't!

1211
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:29,660
Sheeta.

1212
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,290
Pazu...

1213
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:42,710
The roots protected us.

1214
01:58:59,010 --> 01:59:00,480
We can still use this.

1215
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:02,360
Here goes.

1216
02:00:12,110 --> 02:00:13,755
What are you doing?

1217
02:00:13,775 --> 02:00:15,420
We're not moving.

1218
02:00:15,430 --> 02:00:18,600
Of course not, we're overloaded.

1219
02:00:23,150 --> 02:00:24,440
It's Sheeta!

1220
02:00:25,660 --> 02:00:26,650
She's alive!

1221
02:00:26,650 --> 02:00:27,610
It's them!

1222
02:00:31,950 --> 02:00:33,450
Granny!

1223
02:00:33,450 --> 02:00:34,910
Thank God you're alive!

1224
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:36,910
You guys OK?

1225
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:39,075
We're not!

1226
02:00:39,095 --> 02:00:40,990
My galleon's wrecked...

1227
02:00:42,350 --> 02:00:44,415
Oh, stop blubbering.

1228
02:00:44,435 --> 02:00:46,500
We'll build a better ship!

1229
02:00:46,510 --> 02:00:51,570
You poor child, the worst is having your hair hacked off...

1230
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:52,655
- I can't breathe!

1231
02:00:52,675 --> 02:00:53,750
- Sorry.

1232
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:57,300
Pathetic.

1233
02:00:57,320 --> 02:00:59,260
All that work, and only this to show.

1234
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:04,940
We ran out of time!

1235
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:46,620
ano chiheisen kagayaku no wa  The reason the horizon shines doko ka ni kimi o kakushite iru kara is that somewhere it's hiding you.
