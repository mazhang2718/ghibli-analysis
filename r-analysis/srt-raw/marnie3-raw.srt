00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,552
Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network,
Dentsu, Hakuhodo DYMP, Walt Disney Japan,
Mitsubishi, Toho and KDDI presents

2
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:35,285
In this world, there's an
invisible magic circle.

3
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:45,462
So you did go out with him!
What?

4
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,426
There's inside and outside.

5
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,763
Capture the movement.

6
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,557
It's hard.
Right?

7
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,601
Let's see.
Hey, no looking!

8
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,895
These people are inside.

9
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,776
And I'm outside.

10
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,154
But it doesn't matter.

11
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,782
How's it coming?

12
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,831
Um, I...kind of still drawing.

13
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,125
Let me have a look.

14
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,805
Oh, no.
Are you okay?

15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,473
Hey,
hey...

16
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,318
I...

17
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,864
I'm not sure about myself.

18
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,676
Anna...

19
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,013
You're fine now.

20
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,892
Oh, I'm so glad.
Thank you, Doctor.

21
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,146
Anna, do you feel
all right now?

22
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,522
I'm fine.

23
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,817
You looked like
you were in agony.

24
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,861
Where was your inhaler?

25
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,698
I cost you money again.

26
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,242
Why do you say that?

27
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,206
Oh, Miyoko.

28
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,627
I brought Anna's bag.
Her notebook is inside.

29
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,212
Why, thank you.

30
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,548
We were just nearby.
If there's anything else...

31
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,550
Wait...

32
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,346
Has Anna been getting along with you?

33
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,848
She tells me nothing about school.

34
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,725
She's okay.

35
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,852
But she's very quiet.

36
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,271
Quiet? More like...

37
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,065
Hey, don't.

38
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,859
We're just a bit loud.

39
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,863
Well, take care.

40
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,492
Ever the worrywart, your mother.

41
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,414
Mother...?

42
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,712
She's probably a hermit at school.

43
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:36,007
It's true that stress
can trigger asthma.

44
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,302
Meanwhile, my husband's
off on a business trip.

45
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,057
Maybe he and I are
partly to blame, too.

46
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,393
12 years old...

47
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,729
It's a difficult age.

48
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,482
Have you noticed
anything about her?

49
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,487
She...always has
an ordinary face.

50
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,573
Ordinary face?

51
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,827
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,624
Like she won't
show her emotions...

53
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,753
She used to be
more expressive.

54
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:17,340
But these days,
I don't even know...

55
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:24,848
Maybe it's as if she
weren't my daughter.

56
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:30,687
You may want to send her
somewhere to get better.

57
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,654
7:03 Departure for KUSHIRO

58
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,620
Say, Anna...

59
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,500
Do you remember
Uncle and Aunt Oiwa?

60
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,630
The air is very clean
where they live.

61
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:04,513
It'll help your condition
to spend some time there.

62
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:10,602
I can't go with you but
they'll take care of you.

63
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,815
Be a good girl,
eat well...

64
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,025
and come back
nice and happy.

65
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,865
She worries too much.

66
00:05:40,865 --> 00:05:44,865
When marnie was there

67
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,538
Oh, here she is.

68
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,832
Anna.

69
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,046
Remember us?

70
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,216
No, but Auntie told
me all about you.

71
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,843
I'm Anna Sasaki.

72
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,430
I hope I'm not much trouble.
Thank you for having me.

73
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,725
Our pleasure.

74
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,435
Auntie?

75
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,270
She means Yoriko.

76
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,444
Get on in.
Sorry it's a bit of a clunker.

77
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,579
Sorry it's tight in here.

78
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,247
I don't mind at all.

79
00:06:55,123 --> 00:07:00,170
This area's changed since I was last here.
All these new shops.

80
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,132
Where we're headed is a nice,
relaxing place.

81
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,803
But since the highway was built,
people stopped coming.

82
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,990
They still haven't
fixed that pothole!

83
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,120
I hear you have asthma?

84
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,205
Uh, yes...

85
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,124
The wind here will
fix you up in no time.

86
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:50,011
Nice place, huh? Bet you'd
like Auntie to see it, too.

87
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,638
What's that over there?

88
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,015
On the cliff.

89
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:59,020
Oh, that's a silo.
It's for storing feed for livestock.

90
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,190
Hasn't been used in decades, though.

91
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,986
Now the village kids
use it for dares.

92
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,989
They say there are ghosts there.

93
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,991
Dear, please!

94
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,660
He loves stories like that.

95
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,787
Best to stay away from there.

96
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,044
Look, that's our house over there.

97
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,261
Here, mind taking this in?

98
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,512
What's this?

99
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,016
Why would you accept this?

100
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,686
It's too much for us to eat.

101
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,523
He's always accepting
gifts without thinking...

102
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,695
Our kids are all grown
up and moved out.

103
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,572
Make yourself at home.

104
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,489
Thank you.

105
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,451
Let's see, these go where...

106
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,536
Excuse me.

107
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,757
You must think it's an odd house.

108
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,092
No, it's a lovely home.

109
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,472
No need for being modest!

110
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,976
Your room's upstairs.

111
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,438
It was my daughter's room.

112
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,320
It'd be sad to clear everything,
so I left it as it was.

113
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,280
I see.

114
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,909
She's a yoga teacher in Tokyo now.

115
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,745
I'm thinking of trying it myself.

116
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,750
Oh, and feel free to use
the closet and shelves.

117
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,418
Oh, thank you.

118
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:58,348
'Write me how things are,
whatever you please. Yoriko'

119
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,435
Postcards, how quaint!
You should write her.

120
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,646
Come here for a sec!

121
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,272
Corning!

122
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,942
He can be so pushy.

123
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,652
See you later.

124
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,493
Seems a little stuffy in here.

125
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:31,893
Oh wow!

126
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,570
Feels nice.

127
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,322
I've arrived safely.

128
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,533
It's quite nice here.

129
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,162
Mr. and Mrs.Oiwa
are both very kind.

130
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,211
To Yoriko Sasaki

131
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,844
These are delicious.

132
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,014
Sorry, my hands are full.

133
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,850
Um, I'm going to mail this in.

134
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,519
Sure, go on.

135
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:27,979
Won't you try this?

136
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,564
Later.

137
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,066
Okay, I'll save it for dessert.

138
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,870
By the way, there's a
shortcut by the parking lot.

139
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,038
Oh, thank you.

140
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,373
SHORTCUT

141
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,254
This is the shortcut?

142
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,915
Boys just drive me mad!

143
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,833
It's tough being
class president.

144
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,544
Wait, I need to drop off a letter.

145
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,553
Hey, who's that?

146
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,333
What is it?

147
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,463
That mansion seems familiar.

148
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,998
I wonder if anyone lives here.

149
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,756
Excuse me...

150
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,357
What a big house.

151
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,933
I guess there's no one here.

152
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,515
Oh, no...

153
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,290
Thank you.

154
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,896
He's a bear.
Or maybe a sea lion.

155
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,884
Sounds like an adventure!

156
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,429
Completely different in
high tide, isn't it?

157
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,890
It's the power of the moon.

158
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,269
But imagine that, Toichi giving
a girl a ride on his boat.

159
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:04,857
He's actually a good guy.
Just not much of a talker.

160
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,904
You should ask him for a ride again.

161
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,615
Ask him for a ride.

162
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,743
I will.

163
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,790
But it's best you stay
away from 'The Marsh House'.

164
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,210
How come?

165
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,671
Ghosts.

166
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,505
Not again!

167
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,967
I'll get some wine.

168
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,886
Looked like no one lives there.

169
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,596
Not now, anyway.

170
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,434
Used to be a vacation home
for some foreigners.

171
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,813
Then it changed hands a few times.

172
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,899
But it's been vacant
for a while now.

173
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,610
I see...

174
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,015
Someone's there.

175
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,517
Have you finished them yet?

176
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,687
What Mrs.Kadoya asked for.

177
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,356
Oh...almost done.

178
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,858
Hey, Anna.
Going out?

179
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,193
Yes.

180
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,862
Just finish them already...

181
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,366
I'm going to go sketch.

182
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,867
Sure, go on.

183
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,035
Thank you.

184
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:30,211
Yoriko was worried about her,
but she looks fine to me.

185
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,714
As long as she's having
fun and eating well.

186
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,549
That's for sure.

187
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,391
All the trash you pick up
will be collected here.

188
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,893
Everyone listen!

189
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,395
Now begin!

190
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,566
Look, it's Toichi.

191
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,984
Toichi 'The Quite One'!

192
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,405
Toichi who only
talks once a decade!

193
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,908
Hey, I said we're not
going there until later!

194
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,077
We're just checking it out!

195
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,286
See ya!

196
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,581
Perhaps we'll hear
from you next time!

197
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,977
I'm going out.

198
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,313
Wait, Anna.

199
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,985
I have a little errand,
so hold on.

200
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,655
Yes.

201
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,161
He should be delivering
these himself.

202
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,164
'I'm allergic to that lady' he says!

203
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,751
But Mrs.Kadoya's been
wanting to meet you.

204
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,838
Their daughter Nobuko is
a year older than you.

205
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,677
Nobuko is at cram school today.

206
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,679
Oh, that's too bad.

207
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,766
This must be Anna.
Nice to meet you.

208
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,020
Oh, um...Hello.

209
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,023
Ah, so you draw, I see?

210
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,691
Show me next time.

211
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,819
No, I'm not very good.

212
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:06,283
Oh, you should go to the Tanabata
Festival with Nobuko tomorrow.

213
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:10,204
Great idea! I should still
have my daughter's yukata.

214
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,207
You can wear it to the festival.

215
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,042
But...

216
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,545
Yes.

217
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,548
I'll let Nobuko know.
Now come in.

218
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,508
Where'd I put it...

219
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,552
Uh, actually I...

220
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,555
Oh, you're going sketching.
Go ahead!

221
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,892
She'll look great!

222
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,061
Ready, and..

223
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,230
This one, too.
Got it.

224
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,566
I won't look good in it.

225
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,402
Maybe she shouldn't have.

226
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,249
He's not here.

227
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,279
Bye.
See you tomorrow.

228
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,311
The tide is out.

229
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,001
Again.

230
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,513
I don't like festivals.

231
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,022
Hey, let's go.

232
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,524
Wait for me.

233
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,318
Here you go.
Thank you.

234
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,529
Here's some candy.
Thanks.

235
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,367
I wish I was wearing a yukata, too.

236
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,369
At least you're comfortable.

237
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,288
Mom says I should wear those.
It's not fair.

238
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,207
I think it looks cute.

239
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,042
What?
No way!

240
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,212
It's boring and tacky...

241
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,048
So Anna, where are you from?

242
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,883
From Sapporo.

243
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,220
Cool, I bet the city
has great shopping.

244
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,389
Maybe lots of cute boys, too?

245
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,224
You be quiet.

246
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,392
Sure, sure.

247
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,395
Not much to choose from
here in the countryside.

248
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,398
Why'd you come out here?

249
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,400
Well...

250
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,236
What's this?
Nobuko!

251
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,362
What is it?

252
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,908
He's always making
the same mistakes.

253
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,077
I'll warn him next time.

254
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,377
There it is.

255
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,004
Will my wish come true?

256
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:50,090
Can I have a candle?

257
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,717
Here you go.

258
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,770
Write your wish on this.

259
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,441
My wish...

260
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,779
Ow!

261
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,947
Sorry about that.

262
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,327
Anna!

263
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:22,331
Hey, where were you?
I was looking for you.

264
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,458
Oh, your wish.

265
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:26,293
Let's see...

266
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,380
'I wish for a normal life everyday'

267
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,299
'Normal'?

268
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,135
Anna, what do you mean by normal?

269
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,345
Uh, well...

270
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,930
You see, urn...

271
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,848
Hey, your eye color!

272
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:41,809
What?

273
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,103
It's really pretty.

274
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,979
It's a bit blue,
like a foreign...

275
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,648
Leave me alone!

276
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,567
All of you!

277
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,488
Huh...?

278
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,492
Uh...
I mean...

279
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,663
I see what you mean by normal.

280
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:08,001
But there's no use
pretending to be normal.

281
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:12,005
After all, you look
like just what you are.

282
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,344
Okay, now let's drop it.

283
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,680
You should join us next...

284
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,516
Anna!

285
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,518
Hey, watch it!

286
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,697
Like just what I am...

287
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,141
Like just what I am...

288
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,561
Not good looking, slow,

289
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:09,897
moody,

290
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,024
unpleasant...

291
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,569
That's why...

292
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,072
I don't know
myself anymore.

293
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,243
That's why everyone...

294
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:30,584
We don't have long to live.
Typically, you're the ones who...

295
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,753
Still talking about that?

296
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,547
We already settled this matter.

297
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,258
We're not blaming you.
It's just that...

298
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,595
I've already told you.
It's not about money.

299
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,263
I feel bad for her, but...

300
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,099
It'll be best for her if you two...

301
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,287
I'd better get home.

302
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,481
Did someone row it here?

303
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,207
It's stuck!

304
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,549
Throw me the rope!

305
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,217
The rope?

306
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,555
Hurry!

307
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,254
Are you okay?

308
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,592
Yeah. Oh, urn...

309
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,262
Are you a real person?

310
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,431
Don't let anyone hear.

311
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,435
You look like the girl
I saw in my dreams.

312
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,270
Dreams?

313
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,953
Thanks.

314
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,792
It's not a dream.

315
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,467
What's your name?

316
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:08,969
Anna.

317
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:12,222
I'm would like to
get to know you.

318
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,974
What about you?

319
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,143
Yes.

320
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,771
Have you seen me before?

321
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,815
Yes.

322
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,483
Often.

323
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:28,655
I just got here.
How long have you been here?

324
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,824
I've been here for ages...

325
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,717
Look at this,
the marsh at night.

326
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:53,513
How beautiful. Say, let's
go down for a closer look.

327
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,598
Madam.

328
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,017
I know.

329
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,520
By the way, where's that child?

330
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,023
Was she not in her room?

331
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,528
I need to get back.

332
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,655
Were they talking about you?

333
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,698
Yes.

334
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,536
Usually I'm in bed by this hour.

335
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,541
Come on, I'll row you back.

336
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,294
So it was your boat.

337
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,714
Yes, I left it for you on purpose.

338
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,554
But I thought you'd
row a little better.

339
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,060
I know.
So did I.

340
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,065
You're my precious secret.

341
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,694
I haven't told anyone
about you, and I won't.

342
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:53,657
If someone finds out,
they'll only spoil it.

343
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,583
Please, promise me.

344
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,419
That we'll remain a secret.

345
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,255
Forever.

346
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,757
Yes.

347
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,718
It'll be our secret.

348
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,011
Forever.

349
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,641
It was teary. She came home crying!

350
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,144
Did Anna say something?

351
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,980
She called my daughter names!

352
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,982
Names?

353
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:13,778
And she pulled out a cutter, too.
The horror!

354
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,863
I doubt she'd...

355
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,991
No, you need to hear it
from the girl herself.

356
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,868
Now bring her here.

357
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,996
Seems she's not home yet.

358
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,834
She's out of place,
out and about this late!

359
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,004
You two should
look into that!

360
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,007
Better keep an eye on her.

361
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,179
Take this.
It's dark.

362
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,680
No, thank you.

363
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,686
What if something happens
to one of the kids?

364
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,024
So what if she's a bit late!

365
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,692
Don't get so worked up.

366
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,028
She is not out of place.

367
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,031
Ah, she's home.

368
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,200
Anna.

369
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,369
Aunt Oiwa...

370
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,830
Were you listening?
Don't you worry.

371
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,542
You two will get
along just fine.

372
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,879
Now take a bath and have dinner.

373
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:13,880
Thank you.

374
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:17,050
Or is it dinner before the bath?

375
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,219
It hardly matters.

376
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,722
But names is a bit harsh.

377
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,725
That's for sure.

378
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,560
It's not that funny.

379
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:48,081
Auntie, inquiring like always.

380
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,796
Anna!
Watermelon!

381
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,720
Anna?

382
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,726
Two hours until high tide...

383
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,147
Hop in.
Time for a picnic.

384
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,608
I brought juice and cookies.

385
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,778
Picnic?
At this hour?

386
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,781
That's right.
Let's go across the marsh.

387
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,545
You're very good at rowing.

388
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,508
You need rowing lessons.

389
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,884
Come here.

390
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,973
It's easy.

391
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:41,194
Remember I said last night
that you're my precious secret?

392
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,533
I remember.
And you're my secret.

393
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,326
I'm glad.

394
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,204
Hey!

395
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,003
Good, you're doing well.

396
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:06,386
But I don't even
know your name yet.

397
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,558
I hadn't told you?

398
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,601
Marnie.

399
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,854
I thought you already knew.

400
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,190
That's dangerous.

401
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,493
Go ahead, just row.

402
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,889
There's so much I want
to know about you.

403
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,058
But I want to find out slowly.

404
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,562
Slowly, by myself,
as we go along.

405
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,063
Okay.

406
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,733
I'll tell you what we'll do.

407
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:06,946
We'll ask each other
three questions a night.

408
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:07,947
Great.

409
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,575
All right,
I'll start.

410
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:14,579
Question one:
Why are you here in this village?

411
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,498
I have asthma.

412
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:22,587
The doctor said I should go
somewhere with clean air for a while.

413
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,131
Even by skipping school.

414
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,758
Oh no, you're ill?

415
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,635
If there's no attack, I'm fine.

416
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,264
So I'm staying here with
Auntie's relatives, the Oiwas.

417
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:34,641
Who's Auntie?

418
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,643
It's my turn to ask now.

419
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,520
Do you live in that mansion?

420
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,231
Ever since I was two.

421
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,442
With Nan and the maids.

422
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,444
It's juice.

423
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,447
Where are your parents?

424
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:54,118
They only come here sometimes.
They're busy with work.

425
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,453
I see.

426
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,623
Question two:
Who's Auntie?

427
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,542
My guardian.

428
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:07,465
But I was a worry to her,
so she sent me here for a while.

429
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,008
What do you mean?

430
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,302
I'll explain that
some other time.

431
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,513
It's my turn now.

432
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:15,848
Do you have siblings?

433
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,475
I'm an only child.

434
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,310
I see, you too...

435
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,520
How come?

436
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,690
Oh, it's nothing.

437
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,652
Just curious what it's
like to have siblings.

438
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,656
I know, it'd be fun
to imagine that.

439
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,700
All right, question three.

440
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,869
What's it like living at the Oiwas?

441
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,705
At the Oiwas?

442
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,084
Huh...

443
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,503
How strange...

444
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,839
I can't...

445
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,174
remember...

446
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,962
Marnie?

447
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:32,717
Marnie!

448
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:33,968
Anna!

449
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:40,099
There you are.
I wondered where you went.

450
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,437
Marnie?

451
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:53,654
I looked all over for you.
You just disappeared.

452
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,907
I didn't go anywhere.

453
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,618
I was just trying to
answer your question.

454
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,995
Wait...

455
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,081
What was it?

456
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,250
It's okay, it doesn't matter.

457
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,753
I need to go soon.
Today is...

458
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,049
Oh, I know!

459
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:19,180
No no no, I really can't!
Parties aren't really my...

460
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,598
Don't worry.

461
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,601
I have a great idea.

462
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,304
It's true.

463
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,098
That's hard to believe.

464
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,990
Sorry, did you wait long?
I had trouble getting away.

465
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,825
Marnie.

466
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:23,327
What do you think?

467
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,830
It's pretty.

468
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,710
I borrowed Nan's shawl.
I'll be scolded again.

469
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,545
This won't work.

470
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,506
Don't worry,
I spoke to Father.

471
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,347
Young lady...

472
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,351
I believe it is
past your bedtime.

473
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,021
And who might this be?

474
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,567
She is wearing my shawl.

475
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,528
Upstairs!

476
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,364
Wait right there!

477
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:17,048
You must be up to no good again.

478
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,050
You go that way.

479
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,055
Marnie!

480
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,557
Why you little...

481
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,321
Marnie!
Open it!

482
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,280
Let's go.

483
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,241
If you keep this up,

484
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,910
you'll grow up to
be childish always!

485
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,879
Everyone, we have a
lovely flower girl here.

486
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,257
A guest of my daughter.

487
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,800
Ah, a flower girl.

488
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,428
There's Marnie.
She'll be pretty like her mother.

489
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,974
May I please have
one of those flowers?

490
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,601
My mother.

491
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,946
Hello, dear little witch.

492
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,950
That woman there's the real witch.

493
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,713
I want only one,
for good luck.

494
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:43,301
Will someone kindly
pay for my flower?

495
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,306
If it is the witch's command...

496
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:50,683
Then I'll have one, too.

497
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,477
Here.
For superb luck.

498
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,816
Ah, it's begun.

499
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,156
I'm sorry!

500
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,365
Oh, she ran away.

501
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:25,217
Come take one for luck!

502
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:42,902
Young lady.

503
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,363
To your health.

504
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:49,033
Thank you.

505
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,221
Wine?

506
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,484
Awake now?

507
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,113
I...

508
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,907
Are you okay?

509
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:34,912
Who was that?

510
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,455
Which one?

511
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,124
The one dancing with you.

512
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,294
You mean Kazuhiko?
An old friend.

513
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,756
He's a good dancer.

514
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,008
So are you.

515
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,974
Now let's dance,
you and I.

516
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,105
I can't dance.

517
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,107
Just follow my lead.

518
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,500
Look for me again.

519
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:07,171
And don't tell anyone.
Promise.

520
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,214
I know.

521
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,552
Hey, wait...

522
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,031
Is that...?

523
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,080
It's the girl with the Oiwas.

524
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,238
I see. Hope you find
the other shoe.

525
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,907
It must be somewhere.

526
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,909
I'll go look.

527
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,287
Used to always lose mine.

528
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:25,082
There's a bunch buried
in the mud flats.

529
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,084
Don't compare her to you.

530
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:30,421
I should have my
daughter's old shoes.

531
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,298
I'll get them out.

532
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,425
Thank you.

533
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,944
Marnie...

534
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,481
Wow.

535
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,861
Not only are they big,
they're delicious, too.

536
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,713
You're good with the knife.

537
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,466
Auntie teaches me all the time.

538
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,553
You're so polite
and well-behaved.

539
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,348
My daughter could learn from you.

540
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,184
Passing behind you.

541
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,605
I remember when you first
came to Yoriko's place.

542
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,191
She was ecstatic.

543
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:21,198
She wanted to make up for the
five years she didn't have with you.

544
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:26,912
So she taught you things,
like knife skills.

545
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,377
But she worries too much.

546
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,047
Always calling me for help.

547
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,551
When I told her I was busy,
she started complaining.

548
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,262
Oh, I shouldn't share
this about your mother.

549
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,557
No, I understand.

550
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:51,270
You know, Yoriko sent us
tons of photos of you.

551
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,605
I'll show you later.

552
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,235
Hey, look.

553
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:02,281
Found the wind chime
I made on our honeymoon.

554
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,909
To survive the summer.

555
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,414
Your hair's getting long.

556
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,958
Shall I give you a haircut?

557
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,252
That would be a disaster.

558
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,448
Mar...nie...?

559
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,992
Look for me again.

560
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,502
How could I nearly
forget about Marnie?

561
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:14,478
Marnie...

562
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,526
Marnie!

563
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,491
Marnie...

564
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,905
May I?

565
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,033
Sure.

566
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,953
I see you draw, too.

567
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:16,373
That girl looks like
someone I knew.

568
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,250
She was a great girl.

569
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,920
Yes, she is.

570
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,966
But I haven't seen
her in a week.

571
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:31,221
I wonder if she's
upset that I forgot.

572
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,893
If she's a friend, talk to
her and you'll be fine.

573
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:39,730
Say, will you take a look?

574
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,231
Sure.

575
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,117
Are the colors too messy?

576
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,411
No, it's wonderful.

577
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,455
I'm Hisako.

578
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:00,417
I'm in love with 'The Marsh House'.
What about you?

579
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,338
I'm Anna.
I love it, too.

580
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,431
Better hurry and
finish your drawing...

581
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,934
before the new folks move in.

582
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,269
The renovations are under way.

583
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:26,276
Thanks for your hard work.
Have some tea.

584
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:29,112
Oh, thank you.
Appreciate it.

585
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,491
Hey, let's take a break!

586
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,451
All right, coming.

587
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,131
Are you Marnie?

588
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,222
Come.

589
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,322
I hadn't seen the front before.

590
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,575
It's a lot cleaner now,
but not done yet.

591
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:19,246
Hello.

592
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,706
Hey there.

593
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,833
Brought a friend, huh?

594
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,169
Never mind the flip-flops.

595
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,046
A Quest?

596
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,214
Yeah, a secret one.

597
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:30,716
Secret?

598
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,342
Hey!

599
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:35,178
Sorry, make yourself at home.

600
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,181
Thank you.

601
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,022
Yes, it's a lovely place.

602
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:48,567
Yes, we're still in the
middle of renovation.

603
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,527
This room...

604
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,032
Upstairs.

605
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,785
This hasn't been renovated yet.

606
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,042
Here, this is my room.

607
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,087
Really...

608
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:14,718
What do you think?

609
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,429
It's a cute room.

610
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,725
It used to be your room, right?

611
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,394
You're...

612
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,563
Marnie, right?

613
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,900
Me? No, no!

614
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,779
But...then why have you
been staring at my room?

615
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:34,654
Because...

616
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,908
See, that's where
I always see you.

617
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,827
I've seen you many times.

618
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:43,914
No, no.

619
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,250
I just love this mansion, that's all.

620
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,543
That can't be.

621
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,923
When I said Marnie earlier,
you were surprised.

622
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,009
Rather, why do you know Marnie?

623
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,808
I found it behind the shelf.

624
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,769
A diary?

625
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:08,438
That's right.
Your diary.

626
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,614
Marnie!

627
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:23,161
I'll pour you some
Queen Mary, your favorite.

628
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,539
I'll be back.

629
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,172
'Last night I went for
a row in my nightie.

630
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:39,177
The marsh and the moon
were very pretty at night'

631
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,888
I shall do it again.

632
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,310
June 8th.
A party!

633
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:53,150
Father, Mother and many of their
friends came. It was such fun.

634
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,695
I went outside from the sunroom

635
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:01,032
and danced with a flower girl.

636
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,411
But...

637
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:09,666
Nan locked me in my room
because of last night.

638
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:14,880
So there won't be any
midnight rows for a bit.

639
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:25,182
See, it's you, isn't it?

640
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,685
No.

641
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:30,729
Marnie is...

642
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,856
Marnie is...

643
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:36,568
someone I made up.

644
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:41,364
An imaginary girl,
only in my mind.

645
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,577
But this is Marnie's diary.

646
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,873
It's as if she really lived here.

647
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,920
So you're not Marnie?

648
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:55,879
No.

649
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,881
She's just imaginary?

650
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,090
That's right.

651
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:05,263
I thought you were Marnie,
back for her diary...

652
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,729
I'm Anna. I came from
Sapporo to get better.

653
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:15,315
I'm Sayaka.

654
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,109
I'm from Tokyo.

655
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:24,074
But if she was imaginary,
why is her name the same?

656
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:26,493
I don't know.

657
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:31,456
Marnie must be real.
I'm going to investigate.

658
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,764
Say, Marnie...

659
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:52,310
Who are you?

660
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,292
Is that me?

661
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,718
Marnie?

662
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,469
Marnie!

663
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:42,277
Wait, that one's
not done yet...

664
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,280
Wow, you draw well.

665
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,157
Oh, thanks...

666
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:51,995
I've never had anyone
draw me before. How nice!

667
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,921
I missed you.

668
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,344
I kept calling you in my heart.

669
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:12,807
Me, too.

670
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,184
Let's go.

671
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,560
Come to my room.

672
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:19,564
Come to my room, Marnie.

673
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,737
I can't go far
from the mansion.

674
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:32,077
Okay then, we'll go
wherever you want.

675
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,817
You know a lot
about mushrooms.

676
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:07,737
Father taught me
when I was little.

677
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:11,574
I once brought home three
bags full of mushrooms.

678
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,412
The look on Mother's face!

679
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:27,424
What's wrong?
So quiet all of a sudden.

680
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,594
You're very lucky.

681
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,931
I wish I was you.

682
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,067
Talk to me.

683
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,447
I'm...

684
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:53,867
a foster child.

685
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:59,664
My real parents died
when I was little.

686
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,791
My grandmother, too.

687
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:06,045
I know they didn't
die on purpose, but...

688
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,548
sometimes I feel like...

689
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:11,301
I can't forgive them...

690
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,345
for leaving me all alone.

691
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:20,810
I'm jealous of you.

692
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,646
You're lucky to
be a single child.

693
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:26,649
If you had no relatives,

694
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:30,653
then the folks who took
you in as a daughter

695
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:33,865
must be truly kindhearted people.

696
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,670
Then I'll tell you a big secret.

697
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:54,594
It's about my parents.
They're good to me and they're kind.

698
01:06:55,553 --> 01:07:00,433
I'm not their real child, yet they
raised me, which I appreciate.

699
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:05,522
But you see,
I saw it one day.

700
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:09,067
They're paid for it.

701
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,694
Money?

702
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,614
I found a letter
from the government.

703
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:20,870
It said they were increasing
the subsidy for me.

704
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,457
I'm sure there's a reason...

705
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,417
I don't care!

706
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:33,007
They wouldn't get it if
I were their real child.

707
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:38,388
They get paid because
I'm not their real child.

708
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:46,104
Even worse...
they hide it from me.

709
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,232
I see.

710
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,654
But that doesn't mean
Auntie doesn't love you.

711
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,407
No! Don't you see?

712
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:01,661
None of the other families
receive money. Just us!

713
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:07,250
She always looks worried
that I might find out.

714
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:11,296
And I hate myself for
thinking like this.

715
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:15,174
I...just can't...
believe...

716
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,427
in anything anymore.

717
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:30,273
Anna, it's okay to cry.

718
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,442
Just know that I love you.

719
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:38,823
I love you more than any
girl I've ever known.

720
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,662
Then you tell me your secret next.

721
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:52,128
It was long ago that I went
mushrooming with Father.

722
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:56,507
Nowadays, I hardly see my parents.

723
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,219
Mother's usually travelling.

724
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:08,811
Because of work, Father's home
only twice a year.

725
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:14,651
Usually, Nan and the twin
maids are the only ones home.

726
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,986
And me.

727
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:21,157
I slip out while they're gossiping.

728
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:25,578
And look how free I get to be!

729
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:32,168
It's lovely when my
parents come home.

730
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,504
They host parties!

731
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,548
Like the other day.

732
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,843
With my amazing parents

733
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:44,764
and many people there,
it's delightful.

734
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:49,060
I get to wear new
dresses and dance, too.

735
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:55,733
That's when I'm sure I'm the
luckiest girl in the world.

736
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,444
I see.

737
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:13,334
Tell me, Anna.
Will you be my friend forever?

738
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:14,919
Yes.

739
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,879
I'm your friend forever.

740
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:18,797
Right?

741
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:19,757
Right?

742
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,555
Nan's always in a bad mood.

743
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:30,393
She yanks me by the arm,
brushes my hair very hard...

744
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,563
No one thinks I'm being bullied.

745
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,065
But it really hurts.

746
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,234
Enough to cry.

747
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:43,281
The maids love to frighten me.

748
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,951
They threatened me all the time.

749
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:50,163
'Naughty kids get shut in the silo

750
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,708
where ghosts suck out
their souls' they said.

751
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,587
You mean, the silo on the hill?

752
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,090
Once, they actually took me there.

753
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:02,842
No!

754
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,970
They dragged me all
the way to the silo.

755
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,139
I thought I'd die of fright.

756
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:09,766
Then suddenly,

757
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:14,604
just as we got there, the sky
went dark and the thunder came.

758
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:21,152
The maids were terrified,
so we didn't go inside.

759
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:25,740
I can endure anything else.

760
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,619
Anything but the silo.

761
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:33,289
I never heard such
a terrible thing!

762
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:36,667
I hope the maids and Nan
get struck by lightning!

763
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:42,757
Hasn't anyone ever
tried to frighten you?

764
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:46,177
Never.
Definitely not on purpose.

765
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,680
You're lucky.

766
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:53,059
I wish I was you.

767
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,188
Our castle...

768
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:01,984
Poor Marnie.

769
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:05,071
I love you the most, too.

770
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,490
More than anyone I've known.

771
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,244
Thank you.

772
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:20,711
Funny, it's like
we traded places.

773
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,005
How true.

774
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:31,931
The tide's coming in.

775
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:36,185
Hey, let's go to
the silo together.

776
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:41,357
The ghosts must be a lie.
Let's go make sure.

777
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:45,695
Tomorrow...
No, let's go right now.

778
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:55,329
I don't care who
Marnie really is.

779
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:59,792
I just want to help her.

780
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:13,431
Are you okay, Marnie?

781
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:17,977
Yes, I'm sure I'll be all
right if I'm with you...

782
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:19,729
Kazuhiko.

783
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,282
Anna!

784
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,119
Perfect timing!
I found it!

785
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:48,174
The rest of the diary.
Come to my place.

786
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,967
Marnie...

787
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:54,096
I'm sorry.
Another time.

788
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:57,183
What? But it's a major discovery...

789
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,770
It's going to rain!

790
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,033
Who is it?

791
01:14:58,452 --> 01:14:59,870
Is someone there?

792
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:01,539
Marnie!

793
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:09,380
So you did go ahead.
Don't scare me like that.

794
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:13,342
Marnie.

795
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,390
Are you okay?
Why did you...

796
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:20,516
Kazuhiko!

797
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:25,062
I'm frightened.
I heard somebody below.

798
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,983
I thought I'd die of fright.
Kazuhiko...

799
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:34,155
What're you saying? I'm Anna.
Pull yourself together.

800
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,741
Anna...Anna!

801
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:39,744
I don't want to be humiliated.

802
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,412
But I haven't the courage.

803
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:42,747
Oh, Anna...

804
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:46,751
You do have courage.
You came here.

805
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:50,087
Let's go home.

806
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,436
Wait!

807
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,942
It's just the wind.
Let's go.

808
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:14,612
We'll go home together.

809
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,050
Anna, come back here.

810
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:37,468
Anna!

811
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:41,472
We made it up. I'm sure
we can make it down.

812
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,809
I'll go first,
so follow me.

813
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:49,480
No, don't leave me!

814
01:16:58,656 --> 01:16:59,490
No!

815
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,161
Marnie!

816
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:07,998
Let's go over there.

817
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:24,014
I'm cold...
So cold...

818
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:32,022
Oh Anna, I'm scared...
I'm scared...

819
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:35,693
Don't worry, we'll be
fine if we're together.

820
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:39,029
You did well, Marnie.

821
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,072
Are you okay?

822
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,575
Kazuhiko!

823
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:27,453
I thought you'd never come.

824
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:30,748
I...I...

825
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:40,424
Let's go home.

826
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:06,450
Marnie?

827
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:10,788
Marnie!

828
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:20,464
Marnie!

829
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:30,891
Marnie...You left me behind!

830
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,650
Even you!

831
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:08,637
Kazuhiko...
Kazuhiko...

832
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:11,849
Kazuhiko's all over this diary.

833
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:18,022
'Kazuhiko is trying to
take me to the silo'

834
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:19,857
Silo...

835
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:23,569
Yes?

836
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:26,822
Mom cooked some corn.

837
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,033
Hurry or it'll be gone.

838
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:29,950
Wait!

839
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:34,538
Why go out on a night like this?

840
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,206
It's not safe.

841
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:41,378
My friend might be caught in the rain.
What if she gets pneumonia?

842
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:46,717
Is that...

843
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,969
Anna!

844
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:50,554
Are you okay?

845
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,224
So cruel...

846
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,227
Anna?

847
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,981
So cruel, Marnie...

848
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:03,067
She has a high fever!

849
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:04,568
I'll go get help.

850
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:07,071
Anna.

851
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:11,408
Anna?

852
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:14,745
Anna...

853
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,586
How's she doing?

854
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:26,423
Her fever's not coming down.

855
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,427
She did get a shot earlier.

856
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:32,262
I see.

857
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:44,942
So cruel...

858
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:50,614
Marnie, how could you?

859
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:56,954
I won't forgive you.

860
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:00,457
Leaving me behind without a word.

861
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:28,485
Anna! My dear Anna!

862
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:34,491
Marnie! How could you
leave me behind?

863
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:36,869
Why did you betray me?

864
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:40,873
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to leave you all alone.

865
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:42,833
But...

866
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:48,505
But at that moment,
you weren't there.

867
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,133
What do you mean?

868
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:54,344
Oh, Anna, I...

869
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:57,681
I can't stay here any longer.

870
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:01,185
I have to say goodbye to you.

871
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:06,356
So please, Anna, please
say you forgive me!

872
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:12,196
Anna...

873
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,701
Of course,
I forgive you!

874
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:20,537
I'll miss you, Marnie!

875
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:23,165
And I won't forget you!

876
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:26,251
I'll never forget you!
Ever!

877
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,253
Anna.

878
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,011
Sayaka's here for you.

879
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:22,516
Thanks.

880
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,938
You could see her in your room.

881
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:30,440
No, it's nice outside.

882
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:33,527
The view here is beautiful.
I'd love to show you. Anna

883
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:35,612
Sayaka.

884
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:38,115
Here, a get-well gift.

885
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:39,616
Thanks.

886
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:40,784
Also...

887
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:47,791
This is what made me think
you might be at the silo.

888
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:48,959
What is it?

889
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:52,421
The rest of the diary
you promised to read.

890
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,300
I'm having trouble remembering.

891
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:58,176
I impressed myself.

892
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:02,472
I found a clue in this painting
that was behind the cupboard.

893
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,976
Maybe I'm psychic.

894
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:08,145
Turn it over.

895
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:15,485
Hisako!

896
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:20,657
Hisako!

897
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:39,176
Please, will you tell
us about Marnie?

898
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:40,927
But...

899
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:43,680
it's a rather sad story.

900
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:46,016
I'm ready for it.

901
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:53,523
It was a long time ago.

902
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:58,862
I used to play at
'The Marsh House' often.

903
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:03,200
Marnie and I were very little.

904
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:04,534
It's a bear!

905
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,036
Let me see.

906
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:09,539
This is Daddy.
Isn't he dashing?

907
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,292
Marnie loved to boast about

908
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:16,046
her glamorous parents and
their extravagant parties.

909
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:22,719
But the truth is, she could
have been cared for more.

910
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,558
Goodbye, Marnie.

911
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,185
That dear child...

912
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:35,399
No, don't leave me, Mommy!
Don't go!

913
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:38,568
Seems the maids didn't 
look after her very well.

914
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:40,570
That's not right!

915
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:44,574
Later, Marnie moved to Sapporo

916
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:47,577
and married Kazuhiko,
her childhood friend.

917
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:54,376
With her family apart
and feeling lost...

918
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:57,087
he was there to support her.

919
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:02,759
I'm glad.
So Kazuhiko was a good man.

920
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:07,597
Two years later,
Emily was born.

921
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:13,937
At last in the warm household she'd
always wanted, Marnie was happy.

922
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:20,110
I didn't see Marnie for
many years after that.

923
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:22,946
The next time was...

924
01:27:23,196 --> 01:27:27,284
a few years after Kazuhiko
had passed on of an illness.

925
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,413
By then,

926
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:37,461
Marnie was in mourning
due to the shock.

927
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,296
Mourning?

928
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,424
A place where you go to get better.

929
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,969
What happened to Emily?

930
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:51,641
Marnie's parents had passed on,
leaving no one to look after her.

931
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:58,982
So for elementary school,
she was sent to a boarding school.

932
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:12,496
By the time she returned at age 73,
she'd become a different person.

933
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:14,331
Emily!

934
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:17,167
She was willful and independent.

935
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:19,628
She knew Marnie was ill,

936
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:24,174
but still resented her
for sending her away.

937
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:28,220
You think that makes
you more motherly?

938
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:31,973
I want you to live the
way you wish, but...

939
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:33,517
you need to...

940
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:36,853
They never did
make up after that.

941
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:37,979
As your mother...

942
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:41,024
I've never thought
of you as a mother.

943
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:46,363
Emily ran away and
soon got married.

944
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:49,699
She was expecting, you see.

945
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,388
But...

946
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:19,229
One day, Emily and her husband
got into a car accident.

947
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:25,151
I heard Marnie took their child in.

948
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:32,409
She was determined to never
let this child be lonely.

949
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:35,078
But...

950
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:39,207
she never got over losing Emily.

951
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:44,921
She became very ill,
and passed on the next year.

952
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:50,260
That was about ten years ago.

953
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,435
I'm sorry, it's a sad story.

954
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:01,271
No, thank you very much.

955
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:05,942
Marnie adored that mansion.

956
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:11,948
She loved seeing the
marsh from her window.

957
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:17,454
She said it felt like
the birds spoke to her.

958
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:22,125
She had a lonely life,

959
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:24,461
but she lived it fully.

960
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:28,965
Always with a smile,
determined to be happy.

961
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:33,929
So you've met Marnie, too.

962
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:57,327
Wish we could've
played more, Anna.

963
01:30:57,661 --> 01:31:00,664
The plan was always
just for the summer.

964
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:03,500
Will you come again next summer?

965
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:06,336
I'm sure I will.
I'll write you.

966
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:09,506
I'll write you, too.

967
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:17,013
I put the diary and painting
back where I found them.

968
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:19,349
Good, it's for the best.

969
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:21,851
I haven't told my family.

970
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:24,521
Let's keep it our secret.

971
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:28,858
How funny...

972
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:33,571
Marnie brought us together.

973
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:35,365
That's true.

974
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:38,368
Marnie...

975
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:46,209
The girl trapped behind
the blue window...

976
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,546
That was long ago.

977
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:58,054
Exactly, he does
it to save her life.

978
01:31:58,221 --> 01:31:59,556
I love that part.

979
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:02,726
Ah, now I want to
read it all over again.

980
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:05,228
I'll loan you Volume 2.

981
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:06,730
Anna!

982
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:11,901
Auntie!

983
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:16,072
Anna...

984
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:20,243
Hey, be careful!

985
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:21,745
Sorry, sorry.

986
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:30,587
Auntie's here.

987
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:34,257
Ah, Yoriko, you're here.

988
01:32:36,926 --> 01:32:38,762
Thank you for everything.

989
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:42,265
She's doing well and
even made a friend.

990
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:44,601
How can I ever repay you?

991
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:48,605
Oh, no.
We didn't do anything at all.

992
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:50,732
Anna is a good girl.

993
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:54,110
It was like having
our own daughter back.

994
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:56,112
She's welcome anytime.

995
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:57,947
Thank you.

996
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,449
Let's talk inside.

997
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:05,789
I'm impressed you didn't
call us this time.

998
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:20,970
I'm all packed.

999
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:22,806
Anna.

1000
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:25,308
Yes?

1001
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:30,146
There's something
I need to tell you.

1002
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:36,653
We receive monthly monies
to cover your expenses.

1003
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:38,655
We receive money.

1004
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:42,283
I've long hesitated
to tell you, but...

1005
01:33:42,408 --> 01:33:44,786
It's okay.
But believe me...

1006
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:47,497
Whether or not
we receive monies,

1007
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:49,916
it doesn't change
our love for you.

1008
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:52,669
I already knew.

1009
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:55,672
I'm happy you told me about it.

1010
01:33:55,839 --> 01:33:56,840
Anna!

1011
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:05,181
I've been looking at
the photos you sent.

1012
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:07,350
Photos?

1013
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:12,355
Oh, while you were away I
was looking at old albums

1014
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:14,190
and found this picture.

1015
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:15,692
Do you remember?

1016
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:20,029
It's that mansion.

1017
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:23,825
When you first came,
you wouldn't let it go.

1018
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:28,329
I was told at the adoption

1019
01:34:29,122 --> 01:34:31,374
it belonged to your grandmother.

1020
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:38,882
My beloved home Marnie

1021
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:41,217
Marnie!

1022
01:35:20,089 --> 01:35:22,258
So that's who she was.

1023
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:25,762
Anna.

1024
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:33,603
And so I was in
the silo all night.

1025
01:35:33,937 --> 01:35:36,439
I was very frightened.

1026
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:39,776
That's when your grandpa came.

1027
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:43,613
He encouraged me,
saying I did well.

1028
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:47,784
I've overcome many
frightening things.

1029
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:49,786
And so will you, Anna.

1030
01:35:50,954 --> 01:35:51,955
After all,

1031
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:56,960
you're my one and
only grandchild.

1032
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:00,964
Grandma...

1033
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:46,676
Excuse me.

1034
01:36:49,012 --> 01:36:50,013
Anna.

1035
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:53,516
I'm sorry for what I said.

1036
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:58,187
Don't skip trash
pickup next year.

1037
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:06,696
A friend?

1038
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,031
Maybe.

1039
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:16,372
Hisako!

1040
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:21,210
Anna.

1041
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:24,213
I'm going home to Sapporo now.

1042
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:25,882
Is that right?

1043
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:30,053
But your face tells me
something good happened.

1044
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:33,389
Yes, I'm really happy now.

1045
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:34,724
Good.

1046
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:38,061
Um, this is my mother.

1047
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:42,565
Thank you for being kind to Anna.

1048
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:45,068
Oh no, it was my pleasure.

1049
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,904
Let's draw together again.

1050
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:48,905
Yes.

1051
01:37:49,072 --> 01:37:52,241
I'll write you.
I have some amazing news.

1052
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:53,242
Goodbye.

1053
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:57,747
Thank you very much.

1054
01:38:03,169 --> 01:38:04,587
Amazing news?

1055
01:38:04,754 --> 01:38:06,923
Yeah, I'll tell you later.

1056
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:08,758
Oh, why not now?

1057
01:38:08,925 --> 01:38:10,760
I promise I'll tell you.

1058
01:38:21,938 --> 01:38:26,109
Toichi! Sayaka!
Goodbye!
