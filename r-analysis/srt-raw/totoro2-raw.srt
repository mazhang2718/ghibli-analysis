Dad, do you want a caramel?

12
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,864
Thanks. Aren't you tired?

13
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,739
All right.

14
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,867
We're almost there.

15
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,380
Mei, hide!

16
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,225
It wasn't a policeman.

17
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,761
Hello. Are your parents around?

18
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,094
Thanks.

19
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:44,187
I'm Kusakabe! We've just arrived!

20
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,186
A pleasure to meet you!

21
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,983
Welcome!

22
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,823
Thank you.

23
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,467
Here we are!

24
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,637
Wait!

25
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,098
Mei, there's a bridge!

26
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,316
A bridge?

27
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,741
See that flash? Fish too!

28
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,236
So, you like it here?

29
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,036
Dad, it's terrific!

30
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,867
Look, a tunnel of trees!

31
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,539
Is that our house?

32
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,260
Come on!

33
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,308
It's a wreck!

34
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,851
Wreck!

35
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,520
Looks like a haunted house!

36
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,363
Haunted?

37
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,364
And it's all rotten!

38
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,751
It's gonna fall down!

39
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,550
Fall down!

40
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,190
Look, Mei!

41
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,898
See?

42
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,746
It's huge.

43
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,838
Dad, there's a huge tree!

44
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,424
It's a camphor tree.

45
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,420
Camphor tree...

46
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,601
Oops!

47
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,142
An acorn!

48
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,778
Show me.

49
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,774
Another one!

50
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,289
One for me!

51
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,839
Out of the way.
I can't open the screens.

52
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,624
Acorns!

53
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,126
There's acorns in the house.

54
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,629
They dropped from up there!

55
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,137
Maybe there are squirrels in here.

56
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,063
Squirrels, really?

57
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,978
Or rats that like acorns.

58
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,648
I'd rather have squirrels!

59
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,146
Where shall I put this?

60
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:23,319
Here, I'll get the door for you.
Satsuki, open up the kitchen.

61
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,532
It's just round the back.

62
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,161
Mei, come on!

63
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,164
Wait for me!

64
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,251
Hurry!

65
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,418
Ready?

66
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,133
Bathtubs.

67
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,523
There's nothing here.

68
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,023
That's the bathroom.

69
00:08:39,024 --> 00:08:40,936
Dad, there's something in here.

70
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,904
A squirrel?

71
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:46,775
Dunno. A bunch of black things
but not roaches or mice.

72
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,449
Really?

73
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,207
Can you see 'em?

74
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,298
I think they were...dustbunnies.

75
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,463
'Dustbunnies'?
Like in my picture book?

76
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,889
That's right. Ghosts don't come out
on days like this.

77
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,650
When you walk into a dark room
from outside,

78
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,778
your eyes dim and
so the dustbunnies come out.

79
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,320
I see.

80
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:30,454
Come here, dustbunnies.
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

81
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:40,338
Let's get to work! See if you can find
how to get upstairs.

82
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,926
Get up there and
open all the windows.

83
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,460
Sure!

84
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,963
I'm coming, too!

85
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,106
Toilet!

86
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,559
Not here!

87
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,207
Nothing here!

88
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,338
Nothing!

89
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,267
Mei, it's here!

90
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,476
It's pitch black!

91
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,352
Dustbunnies...

92
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,953
Another acorn.

93
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:04,043
Come out, dustbunnies!

94
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:47,169
Are you there, Mr. Dustbunny?

95
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,661
Dad, there's definitely
something here!

96
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:22,959
That's exciting! I've always
wanted to live in a haunted house.

97
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,251
I'm coming!

98
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,006
I got it. Satsuki!

99
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,605
Mei.

100
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,159
You're full of energy!

101
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:46,918
This is 'Nanny'. She looks after
the house and came to help.

102
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,038
I'm Satsuki and
this is my sister, Mei.

103
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,915
Nice to meet you both.

104
00:13:53,916 --> 00:14:00,344
I'd have cleaned up
if I'd known you'd be this quick.

105
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,725
No, you've done plenty.

106
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:08,273
Lately I've been so busy in the rice
paddies, I only did a bit of dusting...

107
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,476
What have you done to your hands?

108
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,853
The dustbunny got away...

109
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,777
Your feet, too!

110
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,911
Mine are black, too!

111
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,132
That must be the 'soot spreaders'.

112
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:40,629
Those little, black,
fuzzy things that fly?

113
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,384
That's right.
They breed in empty old houses,

114
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:49,060
and cover them with soot and dust.

115
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:57,646
I could see them when I was little.
Now you can too, huh?

116
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,274
Are they like goblins or something?

117
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,860
Naah, nothing so scary.

118
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:09,243
If you keep smiling,
they'll soon leave the house.

119
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:15,131
They're probably deciding
where to go next, right now.

120
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,838
Mei, they're going away.

121
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:23,839
That's no fun.

122
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,434
What happens if a huge one
comes out, like this?

123
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,140
I wouldn't be scared.

124
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,144
Okay then, I won't walk you to
the bathroom at night.

125
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:39,604
Okay, cleaning time. Could you get
some water from the stream?

126
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,775
From the stream?

127
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:41,990
I'm coming, too!

128
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,329
Mei, wait there.

129
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,674
Did you get a fish?

130
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,221
Nanny, it's coming out!

131
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,231
Good, keep pumping 'til the water
gets cold.

132
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,024
Okay!

133
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,907
May I help you?

134
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,907
Huh... my Mom... for Granny.

135
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,113
Yes?

136
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,913
Wait, what is it?

137
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,712
Is that you, Kanta?

138
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:28,719
You live in a haunted house!

139
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,216
Kanta, stop it!

140
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,063
I did the same when I was his age.

141
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:48,694
I hate boys.
But I really love Nanny's rice cakes!

142
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,237
Eat as much as you want.

143
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,406
Thank you!

144
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,244
Thank you very much for your help.

145
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,756
Good bye!

146
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,368
Dad, the house is going to fall down.

147
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,540
I hope not; we've only just moved in.

148
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,915
Come on, let's laugh to keep
the bogeymen away!

149
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,914
I'm not scared.

150
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,796
I mean it. I'm not scared!

151
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,963
One-two, one-two...

152
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,635
Come on, keep up the good work...

153
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,852
Okay! Washing...finished!

154
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,242
Here we go!

155
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,841
Nanny!

156
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,509
Hello!

157
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,012
Hard at work?

158
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,731
Where're you all heading?

159
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,017
To visit Mommy in the hospital!

160
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:54,857
That's nice.
Give her my regards!

161
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,092
This way.

162
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:42,911
Hello.

163
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,697
Hello there.

164
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,407
Mommy!

165
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,993
So glad you came, my dear.

166
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,412
Daddy took the wrong road.

167
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,248
Really? Hello, Satsuki.

168
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,125
It's a school holiday, today.

169
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,585
How nice.

170
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,337
Daddy is talking to the doctor.

171
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,261
It's so good to see you all.

172
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,431
Have you settled into the new house?

173
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,151
A haunted house?

174
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,904
Mom, do you like ghosts?

175
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:20,607
Of course I do!
I can't wait to see them.

176
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,076
See, I told you Mei.

177
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,779
Mei was worried that
you wouldn't like ghosts.

178
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,032
What about you two?

179
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,073
I love them!

180
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,917
I'm not scared of them!

181
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,964
Are you fixing Mei's hair, Satsuki?

182
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,593
It's really good. Lucky girl, Mei.

183
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,296
But she always gets mad at me.

184
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,089
That's 'cuz you won't stay still.

185
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,092
Come here, Satsuki.

186
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,636
Isn't yours too short?

187
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:50,889
No, I like it like this.

188
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,931
Do mine, Mommy! Mine, too!

189
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:53,808
Wait your turn!

190
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:59,395
Wavy hair, just like mine
when I was your age.

191
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:03,321
Will it be like yours when I grow up?

192
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:07,497
Probably. You take after your Mom.

193
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,256
Mom looked really well.

194
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:31,057
You're right. The doctor says
she'll be home soon.

195
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,347
Soon? Like tomorrow?

196
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,848
You always say this.

197
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,522
Tomorrow is a little too soon.

198
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,322
Mom said she'll sleep with me
in my bed.

199
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:45,817
Weren't you saying
you're big enough to sleep alone?

200
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,946
Mom is special!

201
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,933
Dad, time to get up!

202
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,143
Wake up!

203
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,315
Sorry, I overslept again...

204
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,239
I've got to bring a box lunch today.

205
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,578
I totally forgot about it.

206
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,740
It's all right.
I've made something for all of us.

207
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:34,706
It's burning!

208
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:35,542
I'm coming.

209
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,497
Here, this is yours, Mei.

210
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,667
It's for me?

211
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,052
Mei, sit down and eat!

212
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,256
Here, wrap yours.

213
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,262
Satsuki!

214
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,804
- oh.

215
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,433
I'm coming!

216
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,935
You made a friend already?

217
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,938
She's calling you!

218
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,073
Yup, that's Michiko.

219
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,906
Gotta go!

220
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,997
See ya!

221
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,283
See you later!

222
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:18,665
Morning!

223
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,959
Hi, let's go.

224
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,935
Daddy!

225
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,804
Do I look all grown up?

226
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,139
Yes dear.
And where might you be going?

227
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,938
I'm just going out.

228
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,499
Daddy, is it lunch yet?

229
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,753
Already?

230
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,442
You be the flower shop, Daddy.

231
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,038
Pole-tads!

232
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,227
Got no bottom.

233
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:16,741
Gotcha!

234
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,452
Who are you? A big Dustbunny?

235
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,658
To-to-ro? You're Totoro!

236
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,915
I bet you're Totoro.

237
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,814
See you!

238
00:35:47,815 --> 00:35:48,938
Okay, catch you later!

239
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,275
I'm home!

240
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:55,194
Hey there. Is it that late already?

241
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,237
Where's Mei? I'm off to Michiko's.

242
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,663
We haven't eaten yet.
ls Mei in the garden?

243
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,545
Mei!

244
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,722
Dad, I found her hat!

245
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,339
Wake up, Mei!

246
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,093
You shouldn't sleep here!

247
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,255
Where's Totoro?

248
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:56,588
Totoro?

249
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,138
Where?

250
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,180
Were you dreaming?

251
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,898
Totoro was here.

252
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:08,109
You mean that troll
in your picture book?

253
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:15,607
Yeah. He was all hairy with
a big mouth like this.

254
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:22,287
There's a tiny one and a little one
and a huge one like this.

255
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,586
There you are.
Wow, this is amazing.

256
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,712
A great hiding place!

257
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,377
Dad, Mei said she met a Totoro here.

258
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,504
A Totoro?

259
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,302
It's this way.

260
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,357
Hey, wait for me!

261
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,645
Huh?!

262
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,022
Here?

263
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,320
No.

264
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,193
It went to a big tree.

265
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,288
But there wasn't any other path.

266
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,533
Mei! Come back!

267
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:23,177
But it's true! Totoro was here.

268
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,012
I'm not lying.

269
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,484
I know, Mei.

270
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,773
I didn't lie.

271
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:43,031
Neither of us think you're lying.

272
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:49,003
You probably met the king of this forest.
You were very lucky.

273
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,668
He doesn't come out very often.

274
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,583
We should pay our respects
at the shrine.

275
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,585
Pay our respects?

276
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,212
To this forest.

277
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,897
Mei, you're getting heavy.

278
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,571
Daddy, look! That camphor tree!

279
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:22,948
What a big tree.

280
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,040
It's here!

281
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,706
Is that the tree?

282
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,092
Dad, hurry up.

283
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,054
The hole has gone.

284
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,432
Are you sure it was here?

285
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,101
The hole disappeared.

286
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,571
I told you he doesn't come
to see us often.

287
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,316
But will he come again?
I want to meet him, too.

288
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:05,028
If you're lucky, sure.

289
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,997
What a beautiful tree.

290
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:14,003
This tree must have stood here
for years and years.

291
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,301
Trees and people
used to be good friends.

292
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:27,260
I saw that tree and fell in love with
the house. Hope Mom likes it, too.

293
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:30,802
Okay, let's pay our respects
then get home for lunch.

294
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,472
Yes, I promised to go see Michiko.

295
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:34,941
I want to go, too!

296
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,316
Attention!

297
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:41,438
Thank you for looking after Mei.

298
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,658
Please take care of us.

299
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,610
Let's race home!

300
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:47,078
That's not fair! Dad!

301
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,161
Wait!

302
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,492
Hurry UP!

303
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,666
Wait for me!

304
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,458
Dear Mother, something amazing
happened today.

305
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,512
Mei met a giant Totoro.

306
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:13,980
And I'm hoping to see him
myself soon, too.

307
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,379
Kanta, hurry up! You'll be late!

308
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,381
Coming...

309
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,216
Mei?

310
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,092
Excuse me!

311
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,470
Yes, Satsuki?

312
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,889
It's my sister...

313
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,897
What happened, Nanny?

314
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:51,449
I'm sorry. She insisted that
she be with you.

315
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:56,490
It's Dad's day at the university.

316
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,495
You promised to be
a good girl at Nanny's.

317
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:06,801
I still have two more classes
and Nanny's too busy for this...

318
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:12,132
She was good up 'til now,
weren't you?

319
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,687
I'll go talk to my teacher.

320
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:34,997
Since Satsuki's mother is in the hospital,
I want you all to be nice to her.

321
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,458
What's that?

322
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,006
It's Totoro.

323
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,625
Mei, you should keep quiet.

324
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,673
okay.

325
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,481
Bye bye, Mei!

326
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,558
I can't stay after class today.

327
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,601
We'll let teacher know.

328
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,149
See you!

329
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,690
Hurry up, it's going to rain!

330
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:12,692
okay

331
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,122
Here it comes!

332
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,222
Here.

333
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,562
I won't cry. Aren't I good?

334
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,726
It's getting worse...

335
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:52,274
Dear Guardian Spirit,
let us stay until the rain stops.

336
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:37,159
But...

337
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,591
That was lucky.

338
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,848
It's got holes in it.

339
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:17,107
Daddy forgot his umbrella.

340
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,576
I'm going, too.

341
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,989
I said I forgot it!

342
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,369
What idiot forgets his umbrella
on a rainy day?

343
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,290
Ouch!

344
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,830
You broke it playing, I bet.

345
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,128
I did not!

346
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,892
Excuse me.

347
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,732
Hello Satsuki. Hi, Mei. Grandma!

348
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,855
I'm sorry about Mei today.

349
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,699
Not at all.
Sorry we couldn't do more.

350
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,360
Kanta lent us this umbrella.

351
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:06,036
He did?
A broken old thing like that!

352
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,783
Mei was with me, so I was glad.

353
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:12,414
But I'm so sorry that Kanta got wet.

354
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:17,427
Not at all. It probably
cleaned him up a little.

355
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,377
Are you off to meet your father?

356
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,253
YES.

357
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,722
What good girls you are.

358
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,216
Bye bye, Mei.

359
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,062
Who was that?

360
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:38,030
I don't know.

361
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,536
Just in time!

362
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,755
Getting on?

363
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,009
All right, drive on.

364
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,597
Daddy wasn't on it.

365
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:16,944
He'll be on the next one.
Why don't you wait at Nanny's?

366
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,231
Are you okay?

367
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,050
Sleepy?

368
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,847
I told you. Wanna go to Nanny's?

369
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,813
It won't be much longer.
Hang in there.

370
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,818
It's late...

371
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,451
Come on.

372
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,160
Are you Totoro?

373
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:32,097
Wait a minute.

374
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,180
You can use this.

375
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,600
Take it, Mei's slipping off.

376
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:50,608
Hold it like this.

377
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,776
Here's the bus!

378
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,966
He took Daddy's umbrella...

379
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,645
I'm sorry.

380
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:35,772
All right, drive on.

381
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,652
The train was late
and I missed the bus.

382
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,037
Were you worried?

383
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,906
We met him, Dad! He was here!

384
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:46,659
And the cat bus!

385
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,167
What?

386
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,328
It was huge!

387
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:54,175
With big eyes like these!

388
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:59,217
We met him! We met Totoro!

389
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,556
How wonderful!

390
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,478
Come on, Daddy.

391
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:26,405
<i>Dear /I//other, I can '2' tell you
how excited I was today.</i>

392
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:31,202
it was the scariest, funniest day
I've ever had.

393
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:33,626
Totoro gave us a lovely present...

394
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:38,376
wrapped in bamboo /eaves and
tied with dragon whiskers.

395
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:43,383
<i>when we opened it,
it was full of magic nuts and seeds!</i>

396
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:54,267
'We decided to plant them in the garden
to make a lovely forest.'

397
00:55:54,268 --> 00:56:00,992
But they haven 't sprouted yet.
Mei sits there all day, waiting for them.

398
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:05,739
<i>She looks like a little crab</i>

399
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,660
It's nearly summer vacation.

400
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:16,962
Dearest, dear Mom, get well soon.
Love, Satsuki.

401
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,379
Come on. Bed time.

402
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,383
Lights off!

403
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,886
Wait, Dad.

404
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:32,105
Daddy, do you think they will
sprout tomorrow?

405
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:37,528
Well, I'm sure Totoro would know.
Night night.

406
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,737
Mei!

407
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,555
That's where we planted the seeds.

408
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,184
Wow, we did it!

409
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,387
We're the wind!

410
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:42,999
There are no trees!

411
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,586
yes

412
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:53,923
It was a dream.

413
01:01:53,924 --> 01:01:56,217
But it wasn't a dream.

414
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,885
We did it!

415
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:22,949
Mr. Kusakabe! Telegram!

416
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,128
Anyone home?

417
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,175
Nanny.

418
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,802
I'm here.

419
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,807
This one is ripe.

420
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,524
What about this one?

421
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,027
That's good, too.

422
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:09,461
Your garden's a treasure house.

423
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:12,501
Let's take a little break.

424
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:21,298
These should be cold now.

425
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,300
Looks delicious.

426
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,184
So good.

427
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:40,033
The sun blessed these so
they're really good for you.

428
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:42,443
Would they help my Mom, too?

429
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:47,371
Of course. If she eats my vegetables,
she'll get better right away.

430
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,534
She's supposed to be back next Saturday.

431
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,583
She'll sleep in my bed!

432
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,206
At last. That's wonderful.

433
01:03:56,207 --> 01:04:02,556
But it's only for a couple of days.
To get used to the new house.

434
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:07,301
I see. We'll feed her lots of
vegetables, then.

435
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:10,727
I'll give her this corn I picked.

436
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:12,899
I'm sure she'll be very pleased.

437
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,734
Yes!

438
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,610
There was a telegram for you.

439
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:25,533
For us?

440
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:32,081
Dad won't be back till late,
what shall I do?

441
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:35,080
Open it, it might be important.

442
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:42,805
PLEASE CONTACT, HOSPITAL...

443
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:48,302
It's from Mom's hospital!
Something's happened to her!

444
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:52,721
Nanny! What shall I do?

445
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:56,934
Calm down. Do you know
where your Dad is?

446
01:04:56,935 --> 01:05:00,270
I know his office number,
but we don't have a telephone.

447
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:04,492
Kanta, take her to use the phone
in the main house!

448
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:12,705
Mei, stay here with me!

449
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,628
Stay with Nanny, Mei!

450
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:04,010
Hello, I'd like to make a
long-distance call, please.

451
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:09,391
It's Tokyo 31 '1382.

452
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,891
A cute girl, Kanta.

453
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,812
Hello? Yes?

454
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:24,902
Hello, may I speak to
Dad... er... Mr. Kusakabe?

455
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,700
It's his daughter, Satsuki.

456
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,702
Daddy? It's me, Satsuki!

457
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:39,870
Hello, what's up? From the hospital?

458
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:42,706
Okay, /'// ca// them right away.

459
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:45,709
Is there anything wrong with Mom?

460
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:52,184
Don 't' worry.
/'// check and call you right back.

461
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,345
I'm hanging up now, stay there.

462
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:01,352
May I stay here until he calls back?

463
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:04,066
Stay as long as you like.

464
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:13,580
Satsuki!

465
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:25,251
No, this corn is for my Mommy!

466
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,263
No, it's my Mom's!

467
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:52,487
Listen Mei. Mom's not well
so she's not coming home this time.

468
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,074
No!

469
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:58,958
There's nothing we can do.
You don't want her to get worse, do you?

470
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,747
No!

471
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,168
It's just for a few more days.

472
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,469
So you don't care
if she dies, do you?

473
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,432
Stop being silly! I'm going.

474
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,477
Let's go, Mei.

475
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:33,652
I hate you, Satsuki!

476
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:04,103
We should bring the washing in...

477
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:11,573
Don't worry too much, Satsuki.
Nanny's here to help, so cheer up.

478
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:19,573
Your Dad said he'll stop by the hospital
to check on her.

479
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:27,005
Besides, it's just a cold;
she'll be back next week.

480
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:35,214
They said it was just a cold...

481
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:37,841
when she went into hospital.

482
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,348
But what if she dies!

483
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:43,350
Don't be silly, Satsuki.

484
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,183
Maybe Mom will...

485
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:56,702
Stop it. Nobody would leave
two pretty little girls like you.

486
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:01,488
There, there. Don't cry.

487
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:06,211
I'll be here
until Daddy comes back, okay?

488
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:51,251
Mei!

489
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,808
Did she come back?

490
01:11:06,809 --> 01:11:09,273
Wasn't she at the bus stop?

491
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,649
That's strange.
Where has she gone?

492
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:17,615
I was nasty to her,
'cause she was being silly...

493
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:20,817
Maybe she's heading for
the hospital!

494
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:26,865
The hospital? It would take
a grown-up three hours!

495
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:27,662
I'll go look!

496
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:36,302
Kanta, hurry! Tell your dad
that Mei is missing!

497
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:48,058
Stupid Mei. Always getting lost.

498
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,160
Excuse me.

499
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:13,703
Have you seen a little girl pass by?
She's my sister.

500
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:19,052
No, I don't think so.
I'm sure I would've noticed...

501
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,842
Maybe she wasn't here.

502
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,400
Are you sure she came this way?

503
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,074
I don't know.

504
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,652
Please, stop!

505
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:22,565
Jerk! What are you doing?!

506
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:25,444
I'm looking for my sister.
Have you seen a little girl?

507
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:27,324
Your little sister?

508
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:31,328
She's four.
I think she's heading to the hospital.

509
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,408
Did you see anyone?

510
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:38,836
No. We just came from there...
but we didn't see anyone.

511
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:41,755
Thanks anyway.

512
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:44,628
Where have you come from?

513
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,006
From Matsugo.

514
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,266
Really?

515
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:52,061
Good luck.

516
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:04,941
Satsuki!

517
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,703
Kanta!

518
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:10,487
Find her?

519
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:12,161
No. And you?

520
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:17,410
Dad and the others are looking
for her. I'll go to the hospital,

521
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,287
you go back home.

522
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:23,213
I guess she got lost
on the way to the hospital.

523
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:26,512
They found a sandal by the pond.

524
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,643
We're not sure if it's hers or not!

525
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,371
Did you find her?

526
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:31,073
Dear Lord, please protect her and...

527
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:33,945
It's too deep here,
better search further away!

528
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:36,074
Hey, are there any poles left?

529
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,963
Grandma, Satsuki's here!

530
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,383
Nanny!

531
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:56,435
Look, is it hers?

532
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:06,650
No, it isn't.

533
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:23,119
Thank heavens,
I was sure it was hers.

534
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,081
Hey, Nanny was
jumping to conclusions.

535
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,459
It's not hers!

536
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,709
Where's she gone then?

537
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,294
Let's start from scratch.

538
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:33,047
We better hurry,
it'll be dark soon.

539
01:16:33,048 --> 01:16:36,966
I really appreciate
your help, everyone.

540
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:39,015
Don't worry.
Could have been any of us.

541
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:10,166
Please, help me Totoro!

542
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:16,015
Mei is lost. It'll be dark soon.
I'm sure she's scared somewhere...

543
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:47,963
Totoro!

544
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:53,886
Mei is lost
and we can't find her!

545
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:59,893
She must be scared,
please help me find her.

546
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:03,680
I don't know what to do...

547
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:03,994
They can't see the bus.

Mei!

552
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:29,036
The trees are
moving out of the way!

553
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:08,580
Satsuki!

554
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,254
Mei!

555
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,177
You silly girl.

556
01:21:30,178 --> 01:21:32,179
I'm sorry.

557
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:37,940
You wanted to take the corn to Mom?

558
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:48,245
HOSPITAL

559
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:51,995
Will you take us to the hospital?

560
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:55,957
Thank you so much.

561
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:09,513
I'm sorry. They didn't need to send
a telegram just for a cold.

562
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:14,313
The girls must be worried.
I'm sorry to upset them.

563
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:17,390
They'll be fine.
As long as you're okay.

564
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:22,443
We've all learned to cope.
This'll just postpone the enjoyment.

565
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:27,650
They've put up with it so well.

566
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:30,655
I'm especially sorry for Satsuki,
she's been so patient.

567
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:32,948
You're right.

568
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:37,827
I'm going to spoil them
for a while when I come home.

569
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:38,795
No!

570
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,254
She's laughing!

571
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:50,007
Looks like she's fine.

572
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:01,235
I can't wait to get back on my feet.

573
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:04,067
look

574
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,862
Where did that come from?

575
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:14,702
What?

576
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:19,041
I could swear I just saw Satsuki
and Mei laughing up in that tree.

577
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:24,207
Maybe they were too. Look.
