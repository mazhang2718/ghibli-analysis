1
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:53,471
<i>It's funny
how you wake up each day</i>

2
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:57,183
<i>and never really know if it will be one
that will change your life forever.</i>

3
00:00:58,143 --> 00:00:59,853
<i>But that's what this day was.</i>

4
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:03,982
<i>The day I left the city to spend a week
in the house where my mother grew up.</i>

5
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,401
<i>A day I'll never forget.</i>

6
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:12,657
<i>So many years have passed</i>

7
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:18,538
Almost there. Feeling all right?

8
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,373
I'm okay.

9
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:27,672
<i>I left my childhood</i>

10
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:34,596
<i>In a garden green</i>

11
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:40,310
<i>Come in the garden</i>

12
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:44,689
<i>And look at the trees</i>

13
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:51,488
<i>I used to play there when I was a child</i>

14
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:56,409
Oh, Hara.
How many times have I told her?

15
00:01:57,535 --> 00:02:00,121
Wait here. All right? I won't be a minute.

16
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:01,372
Okay.

17
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:08,546
Hara! Your car's blocking
the driveway again.

18
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:15,637
<i>So many years have passed</i>

19
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,686
<i>The dew is still on the roses</i>

20
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:30,360
<i>I left my childhood</i>

21
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:37,575
<i>In a garden green</i>

22
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,681
Shawn? Where are you?

23
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:51,899
Shawn?

24
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:54,360
I'm here, Aunt Jessica.

25
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,030
Come meet Hara!

26
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:31,856
<i>Supper is done and night has come</i>

27
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,822
<i>Let's have tea together
near the fireplace</i>

28
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,783
Nice try.

29
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,997
<i>My house, my home
ls so small, so pretty</i>

30
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:51,959
<i>My mom, my dad We are family</i>

31
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,670
Joy everywhere

32
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:58,758
Hey, back off!

33
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:02,887
Hey! Go get your own!

34
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,992
Arrietty!

35
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,160
What?

36
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:28,788
You went outside again, didn't you?

37
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:32,667
How many times have I...
What happened to your room?

38
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,419
It's my own little garden.

39
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:38,172
If you ask me
it looks more like your own little jungle.

40
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,634
Is that a bay leaf?

41
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:46,514
Where did you get that?

42
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,184
I wanted to wait and give it to you
on your birthday, but...

43
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:51,894
Happy birthday!

44
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:58,943
This will last me all year.

45
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,405
But the bay tree is so far away.

46
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,866
If a bean saw you it would...

47
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,200
Beans don't scare me.

48
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:08,953
The beans should scare you.
That's what worries me.

49
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,955
The world is a dangerous place
for a Borrower.

50
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,833
Your Aunt Eggletina
wasn't scared either and she...

51
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,753
Was eaten by a toad. I know, I know.

52
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,589
If you don't like your gift
I can put it in my room.

53
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:21,466
No, no, I should keep it.

54
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,552
I have just the recipe for these.

55
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,429
I'll have your father borrow some sugar.

56
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,765
Oh, you don't have to.

57
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,601
Because tonight I'll borrow some for you.

58
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:32,977
What?

59
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,480
Don't tell me you forgot!

60
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,690
Tonight's my first borrowing!

61
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:39,942
Look, Papa's home.

62
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:43,780
Papa. Papa, I made it all the way
to the bay tree today.

63
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,908
And I used the leaves over my head
just like you said.

64
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:49,452
And I didn't even get seen by the cat.

65
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,078
So, what I'm trying to say,

66
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:53,581
- if there was any doubt...
- There's a new bean in the house.

67
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,791
What?

68
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:57,460
- I know. I saw him.
- Arrietty, I told you to be...

69
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,587
Yes, Mama, I was careful
and he didn't see me.

70
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,798
And he's much smaller
than other beans.

71
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:04,759
Papa, you just have to let me come
borrowing tonight.

72
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,720
We know nothing
about this new bean.

73
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:09,972
But you promised
this would be my night.

74
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:11,140
And I've seen him.

75
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,935
Papa, please, I am telling you,
he's just a child.

76
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,188
And the children are more vicious
than the grownups.

77
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,357
I'll be fine.

78
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,321
Well, the young beans
do go to bed early.

79
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,865
Oh, thank you, Papa!

80
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:29,700
Pod!

81
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:32,662
The boy is very sickly and weak.
She'll be fine.

82
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:33,788
But...

83
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:39,210
Oh, and don't worry, Mother.
I'll get Papa back safely.

84
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,882
Arrietty will be turning 14 soon.

85
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:47,593
She'll need to know
how to take care of herself out there.

86
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:49,136
Without our help.

87
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,224
Sometimes I worry
that we are the only Borrowers left.

88
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,644
What'll become of us?

89
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,452
Remember what the doctor said, Shawn.

90
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,997
Your heart needs rest. No excitement.

91
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,833
- Is that clear, Hara?
- Yes, ma'am, I'll see to it.

92
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,960
Whatever you need, Shawn,
you ask Hara,

93
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,754
- and she'll get it for you, all right?
- Yes, Aunt Jessica.

94
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,506
Make him feel at home, Hara.

95
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,966
Yes, ma'am.

96
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:38,019
We'll start by keeping the bugs out.

97
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:26,400
Don't you think you should wear
something a little darker and longer?

98
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,694
No, I think this one's perfect.

99
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:34,575
So, I need you to get me
some tissue paper and some sugar.

100
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,369
Oh, and promise, dear husband,

101
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:39,288
you won't let our daughter get eaten
or squashed like a bug.

102
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:41,958
Oh, please God. Please help them.

103
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,920
Don't worry about me. Everything's fine.

104
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,424
Okay, bye, Mom. I love you.

105
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:52,802
Oh, goodbye. Love you, too.
Stay close to your father.

106
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,095
I will

107
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:01,936
Do I get one of those?

108
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,355
Nope? Okay.

109
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,919
Arrietty!

110
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:46,814
Did you see that?

111
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,232
That's my girl.

112
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:56,240
Don't look down.

113
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,994
One step at a time.

114
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,190
All right. You need to hold this for me.

115
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,608
Okay.

116
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:05,976
Arrietty, make sure you hold on tight.

117
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,023
Arrietty!

118
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:55,484
- Let's go.
- Right.

119
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,734
It's so big.

120
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:22,112
Papa, what is this place?

121
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:25,241
This is where beans store all their food.

122
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:26,784
The sugar is over there.

123
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,124
When you get down there, wait for me.

124
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,599
Yeah!

125
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,839
Papa, you are great!

126
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,461
Yay!

127
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,467
There. That wasn't so hard.

128
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,179
- Where to now?
- Tissue paper. Then home.

129
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,863
Papa, look what I found.

130
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,700
Looks like someone
got their first borrowing.

131
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:16,412
Careful with it, it's sharp.

132
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:17,621
Okay.

133
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,311
Papa, borrowing is so much fun!

134
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,569
Look down there.

135
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:57,703
Filthy rats.
You want to stay away from those things.

136
00:17:58,454 --> 00:17:59,538
I'm not afraid.

137
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,209
I will cut them down to size
with my sword.

138
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:08,172
Sometimes it's best not to go looking
for danger.

139
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,386
What is this place?

140
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,140
I've heard human beans
call it a dollhouse.

141
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,268
Dolls are toys for beans.

142
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,562
And we are not toys.

143
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,023
These things are not for borrowing.

144
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,817
Oh, but it's so perfect for us.

145
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:15,239
Don't you think Mother would
absolutely love that dresser over there?

146
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:18,158
If anything went missing,
they'd know right away.

147
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,452
Borrowers take only what they need.

148
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,763
Don't be afraid, okay?

149
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,617
Hey.

150
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:10,330
I know it was you in the garden.
I knew I saw you.

151
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:19,715
My mother used to tell me stories

152
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,760
about the little people
who lived under the floors.

153
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,764
Was it you?

154
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,599
Was it?

155
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,853
Please don't go.

156
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,610
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

157
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,029
He might have seen me
out in the garden today.

158
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,574
We all make mistakes.

159
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,786
So we'll just have to be
extra careful now.

160
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,914
Best not to tell your mother about this.

161
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,832
You know how she worries.

162
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,542
Right.

163
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,758
I'm very proud of you.

164
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:48,303
A lesser Borrower would've panicked
and run away.

165
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:03,735
Well, we're home.

166
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:05,862
Safe and sound.

167
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,750
Is everything okay?

168
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,337
Not quite the adventure we'd hoped for.

169
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,423
This old light gave out
halfway to the kitchen.

170
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,926
No.

171
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:31,346
Well, I'm afraid we had to give up
on the sugar.

172
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:35,433
That's okay.
I'm just happy you made it home.

173
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:37,477
It wasn't a total loss.

174
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:40,814
Arrietty, why don't you show
your mother your first borrowing?

175
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,741
What a beautiful pin.

176
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,788
Okay. Off to bed.

177
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,589
Night, Mama, Papa.

178
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,846
She looks so worn-out.

179
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,765
Should I make us some tea?

180
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:53,214
Shawn, come inside.
You'll catch your death of cold.

181
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:40,220
What did you say?
Why would he do that?

182
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:42,722
I think he was just being nice.

183
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:46,351
It's the same cube of sugar
I dropped in his room last night.

184
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,187
Pod,

185
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:51,981
what does she mean, she dropped it?

186
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:59,114
Do not touch it. Do you understand me?

187
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:04,160
It's a trap.

188
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:07,539
I just know it. They're going to trap us
like cockroaches.

189
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:11,251
Homily, let's try
not to get hysterical, okay?

190
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,337
Don't tell me to not get hysterical!

191
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,256
We'll probably have to move now.

192
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,843
Goodbye, old table.

193
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,887
We had so many fun times together.

194
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,101
Let's not say goodbye
to anything just yet.

195
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,478
Eat your soup before it gets cold.

196
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:34,649
I told you that young bean
would be trouble!

197
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,197
But no one ever listens to me.

198
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:58,298
Thank you, Arrietty.

199
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:01,134
Smart girl, doing this
when the sun came out.

200
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:05,096
Or maybe I have a smart mama
who taught me.

201
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:09,851
You're a good girl.

202
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:12,604
If you've got this,
I think I'll go lie down a bit.

203
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:13,897
Okay.

204
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,111
Is that you from last night?

205
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,991
No, wait. Don't go.

206
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:21,787
I'm sorry if I frightened you.

207
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:23,080
Please leave us alone.

208
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,167
We don't need your help.

209
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:29,086
But can I please just talk to you?

210
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:32,840
No! Human beans are dangerous.

211
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,885
Whenever we're seen, we have to move.
My parents said so.

212
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:40,139
So you have a family. That must be nice.

213
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:43,267
You don't have a family?

214
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,603
Yeah, I have one.

215
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:48,314
But they sent me here
to get the care and attention I need.

216
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:51,525
Because they're both very busy
with their work.

217
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:54,195
Sorry to hear that.

218
00:35:57,615 --> 00:36:00,618
Anyway, my name is Shawn.
What's your name?

219
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:05,414
What do they call you?

220
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:10,378
Not that it's any of your business,
but it's Arrietty.

221
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:14,507
Arrietty. Arrietty.

222
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,510
That's a beautiful name.

223
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:21,847
Maybe we could be friends?

224
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,903
Could you at least come out
so I can see you?

225
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:37,405
I want to make sure I'm not dreaming.

226
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,914
I won't hurt you, I promise.

227
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,513
Help me! Help me!

228
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,173
Hey! Hey! Hey!

229
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:41,844
What in the world? A crow!

230
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:46,682
Oh! Attack! OW!

231
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:51,979
You get out right now!

232
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,534
What got into that bird?

233
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:08,329
Don't think I've ever seen one
behave like that.

234
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:11,207
Maybe it's nesting season or something.

235
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:14,585
I don't know.
Looks me to like it was after something.

236
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:17,380
Oh, look at the holes in the screen.

237
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:19,882
Which I'll have to replace, of course.

238
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,510
Oh, my goodness. Are you all right?

239
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:25,388
Your aunt said for you
not to get too excited!

240
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:26,597
Should I get your medicine?

241
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:30,851
No, that's okay, Miss Hara.
I'm actually feeling pretty good.

242
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:40,277
Nesting season?

243
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:51,914
Well, Shawn, you have a nice,
long rest now.

244
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:52,641
Papa!

245
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:57,313
I hear you visited the young bean.

246
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:58,814
I'm sorry.

247
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:01,650
I went to ask him to leave us alone.

248
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,487
But I really don't think
he intends to hurt us.

249
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:08,699
Many Borrowers have lost their lives
thinking the same.

250
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,077
It must never happen again.

251
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:14,163
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

252
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:26,091
We'd better start looking
for a new home.

253
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,514
The boy knows that we're here.

254
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:36,936
Are we safe?

255
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:12,888
Delivery. Package for you, ma'am.

256
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:18,435
Thanks for the drink, Hara.
It's pretty hot today.

257
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:22,606
Do you happen to know
of any good pest control companies?

258
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,650
Pest problem?

259
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:30,656
Here's one.
"Squeaky Klean Pest Extermination."

260
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:33,867
1-800... Oh, hang on.

261
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:40,833
So you got yourself a mouse problem?

262
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:44,420
Maybe it's mice,
maybe it's little tiny people.

263
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:48,465
Strange things have been
happening here

264
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:51,343
and <i>I</i> know why.

265
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:54,346
That's just
the craziest thing I've ever heard.

266
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,683
I mean, when Hara told me,
I just couldn't believe it.

267
00:41:57,766 --> 00:42:00,728
Why on earth would a crow
try to fly into your room?

268
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,564
Were you frightened?

269
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,608
No, I wasn't scared.
Hara came and chased it away

270
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:09,903
And it's a good thing I came in
when I did.

271
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:12,865
That bird had huge wings and claws...

272
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:15,200
Let's not relive the excitement, Hara,

273
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:18,287
considering Shawn came here
for a little peace and quiet

274
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,456
and tranquility before his operation.

275
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:23,709
Yes, ma'am. Forgive me.

276
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:30,716
I'm sorry, Hara.
I don't mean to be short with you.

277
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:35,137
But why his mother chose this time
to go away on business is just beyond...

278
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:40,225
It must be terribly hard for you without
your mother here to look after you.

279
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:42,603
You know, not so much lately.

280
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,064
I suppose the divorce
couldn't be helped,

281
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:48,233
but honestly, why couldn't she be here
when her son needs her so?

282
00:42:48,317 --> 00:42:50,903
It's the last thing his poor heart needs.

283
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,581
Aunt Jessica, I was noticing
that miniature house in my room.

284
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:04,166
And the detail's amazing.

285
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,418
Oh, you mean the dollhouse.

286
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:09,588
That beautiful little house
belonged to your mother.

287
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:13,258
She had to leave it here
when she moved away to go to college.

288
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:14,510
It was Mother's?

289
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:17,471
Your grandfather had it specially made

290
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:21,517
because he was hoping it would be
a lovely home for the little people.

291
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:22,893
What?

292
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:26,355
That's right.
Little people who lived in the walls.

293
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,107
He was quite obsessed with them.

294
00:43:28,816 --> 00:43:31,193
People laughed, of course,
and called him mad.

295
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,612
But your mother, she believed him.

296
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:37,533
They worked on that house together
for hours.

297
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:41,703
And he told her they would come,
but of course, they never did.

298
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:46,959
Tell me, Shawn, have you ever seen any
tiny little people in your room?

299
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,381
Can't say that I have.

300
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:56,969
I think it's why your mother
doesn't like to come here any more.

301
00:43:57,052 --> 00:44:00,889
Too many memories of wishes
that never came true.

302
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:02,766
Can we look inside it?

303
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:04,226
Yes!

304
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:09,231
You know, I haven't looked inside it
in quite a long time.

305
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,321
Hara, could you be a dear
and turn off the lights?

306
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:17,739
Ma'am.

307
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,668
<i>So many years have passed</i>

308
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,128
This is the living room.

309
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,547
Your grandfather had
all of this handmade

310
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,216
by a real furniture maker in England.

311
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:39,553
Isn't that just insane?

312
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:42,806
Look at the attention to detail.

313
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,267
They really were preparing it
for someone to live in.

314
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:50,397
And just in case you don't believe
what I'm saying is absolutely true,

315
00:44:50,481 --> 00:44:53,317
have a look at that room right there.

316
00:44:58,238 --> 00:45:00,616
<i>Come in the garden</i>

317
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:02,618
What a kitchen!

318
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:03,827
<i>And look at the trees</i>

319
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:06,705
Everything in it
a miniature of the real thing.

320
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:10,334
That oven actually works.
You could bake real cookies.

321
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:12,794
Some really little cookies.

322
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:15,547
What a pity their dream never came true.

323
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:20,385
It really would've made a lovely home.

324
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:27,643
<i>Settled down there long ago</i>

325
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:36,652
<i>So many years have passed</i>

326
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:44,785
<i>The dew is still on the roses</i>

327
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:52,125
<i>I left my childhood</i>

328
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:59,091
<i>In a garden green</i>

329
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:02,010
<i>Come in the garden</i>

330
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:05,430
<i>And sit on the grass</i>

331
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:13,105
<i>I used to sit there when I was a child</i>

332
00:46:14,398 --> 00:46:16,984
<i>Ivy and moss</i>

333
00:46:18,569 --> 00:46:21,613
<i>Little daisies</i>

334
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,952
<i>Covered the lane long ago</i>

335
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,447
You know, Mother,
we've had these same pictures for years.

336
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:46,740
Wouldn't you like some new ones?

337
00:47:47,074 --> 00:47:49,868
Well, Arrietty, I like those pictures.

338
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:53,747
And I've always dreamed
I'd see the real ocean someday.

339
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:57,751
Besides, there's no point
in changing them now.

340
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:04,883
I wonder what's taking Papa so long.

341
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:08,220
Why is my first thought always
that he got eaten by the cat?

342
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:09,471
What's wrong with me?

343
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:14,059
There he is!

344
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:15,811
Does he look eaten?

345
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,357
Hey, Papa, how was it out there?

346
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,487
I slipped and twisted my leg.

347
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,614
I'm lucky that Spiller here found me.

348
00:48:33,704 --> 00:48:35,122
Well, what is going on down...

349
00:48:35,205 --> 00:48:37,249
Pod, you're hurt!

350
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:39,751
It was the cat, wasn't it?
See, I'm not crazy.

351
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:41,002
Get up here!

352
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,422
Does it hurt, Papa?

353
00:48:43,505 --> 00:48:46,550
It's just a sprain. Go calm your mother.

354
00:48:47,718 --> 00:48:49,594
I'll get some cold water. I'll be right back.

355
00:48:49,678 --> 00:48:51,304
Everyone relax!

356
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:54,433
Here's a towel. Dry yourself.

357
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:56,852
Who's that?

358
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:05,193
I wonder if he has news about
any of the other Borrowers.

359
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:15,036
Okay, I leave now.

360
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,206
Can't you at least stay
and have some tea?

361
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:27,966
Arrietty, I'll take care of your father.

362
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,927
Why don't you see
if Spiller would like a cup of tea?

363
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,766
Won't you please stay, Spiller?
I've never met another Borrower before.

364
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:41,897
We can't thank you enough
for your help.

365
00:49:42,606 --> 00:49:44,983
Tell us, have you seen other Borrowers?

366
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:46,276
We're all alone here

367
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:49,237
and we're starting to believe
we're the only ones left. Are we?

368
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:53,992
This many.

369
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:57,412
Oh! Then cousin Lupy
could still be alive.

370
00:49:59,206 --> 00:50:01,333
Oh, that's a bow, isn't it? Can I see it?

371
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:09,591
You use this for your borrowing?

372
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:17,933
Give that back, Arrietty,
before you shoot someone's eye out.

373
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:34,241
Okay. Go now.

374
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:38,286
Oh, but couldn't you stay
a little bit longer?

375
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:39,913
I'll cook dinner.

376
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:43,792
Already got this.

377
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,922
A cricket leg!

378
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:51,842
Want some?

379
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:53,885
- Very fresh.
- No, thanks.

380
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:00,058
Bye.

381
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:02,811
Thank you, my friend.

382
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:08,191
I'll go with him. To see him out.

383
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:17,242
What were you doing out there
in that storm?

384
00:51:17,868 --> 00:51:20,287
I was looking for a safe route
for our journey.

385
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,372
And now I know which route not to take.

386
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:23,832
Oh, Pod.

387
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:27,669
Spiller knows of more Borrowers
a few days journey away.

388
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:30,755
There's a small river past the forest.

389
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:32,507
He's offered to take us on it.

390
00:51:33,008 --> 00:51:34,843
That's great.

391
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:39,514
I'm sure we'll find a new place in no time.

392
00:51:40,432 --> 00:51:44,144
And I'm sure
it will almost be as nice as this.

393
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:50,233
I'm really glad I met you, Spiller.

394
00:51:50,317 --> 00:51:51,651
Or that I met anyone.

395
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:54,696
Hey, maybe next time you could bring
your whole family with you.

396
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:58,033
No family. Only Spiller.

397
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:01,786
Well, we... We could be a family.

398
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,414
And when you come back
you could stay for a family dinner.

399
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:11,231
Hara?

400
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:32,919
Arrietty, your stitches need to be
closer together.

401
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:34,462
You'll have to start over.

402
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:38,633
Why do we need
such a big bag anyway?

403
00:53:38,717 --> 00:53:40,719
Are we putting the whole house in here?

404
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:51,104
I think I'm gonna go check on Papa.

405
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:55,608
Papa, can I come in?

406
00:53:57,861 --> 00:54:00,989
- How's your leg?
- Well, better than that cricket's.

407
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:02,407
I'm serious.

408
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:07,787
Papa, why do we have to move?

409
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:12,584
Once a Borrower has been seen,
the beans' curiosity can't be stopped.

410
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:20,008
Well, isn't it possible that
not every human bean is dangerous?

411
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:24,220
Arrietty, before you were born

412
00:54:24,304 --> 00:54:27,807
there were two other families
who were living in this house.

413
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:31,311
One family went missing,
they just disappeared.

414
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:33,605
The other one moved away.

415
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:35,398
They were seen by humans.

416
00:54:35,482 --> 00:54:39,527
And so, we have to do
whatever it takes to survive.

417
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:41,946
But, Papa...

418
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:51,498
Oh! Oh, no!

419
00:54:57,712 --> 00:55:01,424
Pod, what is it? An earthquake?

420
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:27,325
Mother!

421
00:55:29,202 --> 00:55:31,955
It won't open!

422
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:37,043
Frame is buckled!

423
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:00,650
The wall!

424
00:56:36,895 --> 00:56:38,188
Homily!

425
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:41,357
Homily, are you all right?

426
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:46,654
Pod, remember how I always said
I wanted a new kitchen?

427
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,053
More bills.

428
00:57:52,095 --> 00:57:54,389
Remember,
take only the things we need.

429
00:58:02,063 --> 00:58:04,232
We can't possibly carry all of this.

430
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:08,903
And, Homily,
don't take anything from the dollhouse.

431
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:13,032
I'm gonna go make sure that it's safe.

432
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:16,369
- You stay with your mother.
- Okay.

433
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:50,069
So you finally came.

434
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:02,832
Did you like your new kitchen?

435
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:07,003
Well, our house looks like a train wreck.

436
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:12,216
But it doesn't matter.
Because I came to tell you goodbye.

437
00:59:17,305 --> 00:59:18,973
Can I turn around?

438
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,749
You're beautiful.

439
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:49,754
My papa said we have to move now.

440
00:59:52,215 --> 00:59:54,092
We've been seen,

441
00:59:54,175 --> 00:59:56,386
and Borrowers
aren't supposed to be seen.

442
00:59:56,928 --> 00:59:58,429
What are Borrowers?

443
00:59:58,513 --> 01:00:00,932
My mother, father,
and I are all Borrowers.

444
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:03,393
We borrow things that beans
won't miss if they are gone.

445
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:06,938
Just little things,
soap, cookies, and sugar.

446
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:09,107
All things that we need to survive.

447
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:11,275
Even my great-grandfather
was a Borrower.

448
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:14,779
I think my grandfather saw
one of you once.

449
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:16,906
It's possible.

450
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:21,869
And it's my fault that you're leaving.

451
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:24,372
Niya! Niya!

452
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:27,166
Don't be like that. Be nice to her.

453
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:29,460
So, in my aunt's house,

454
01:00:29,544 --> 01:00:32,338
how many other Borrowers
are there who are living with you?

455
01:00:33,256 --> 01:00:36,634
It's just my father and my mother
and me.

456
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:38,719
What about in other houses?

457
01:00:38,803 --> 01:00:40,221
I'm sure there are some.

458
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:42,974
But I've only met one other so far.

459
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:49,313
You must be afraid you'll be
the only ones of your kind who are left.

460
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:50,731
What?

461
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,401
Every year there's
fewer and fewer of you, right?

462
01:00:53,985 --> 01:00:57,280
Aren't you scared
that soon you'll all be gone?

463
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,117
What a horrible thing to say!

464
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,662
I know that there's more of us
because Spiller said so!

465
01:01:05,288 --> 01:01:06,664
Who's Spiller?

466
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:09,667
He's one of us. He lives out in the forest,

467
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:12,879
and he said that
there are hundreds more of us.

468
01:01:13,546 --> 01:01:14,964
That might be true.

469
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:17,842
But, you know,
none of us can live forever, can we?

470
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:22,430
We all have to die sometime.

471
01:01:23,097 --> 01:01:25,057
Why would you say something like that?

472
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:27,602
Because it's true.

473
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:29,729
I guess so.

474
01:01:30,188 --> 01:01:32,773
Believe me,
I know what I'm talking about.

475
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:37,278
Sometimes things happen to us
that are just beyond our control.

476
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:40,698
And when these things happen,

477
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:43,075
there's really nothing
you can do about it.

478
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,496
You just accept it
and prepare for the worst.

479
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:49,749
I wish it wasn't that way.

480
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:53,127
But you can't live a life
that's built on nothing but wishes.

481
01:01:54,295 --> 01:01:56,297
It isn't practical.

482
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,300
Sometimes you just have to
accept the hand of fate.

483
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:01,969
Oh, no, you don't.

484
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:05,264
Sometimes you have to stand up
and fight

485
01:02:05,348 --> 01:02:07,475
for the things that are worth fighting for.

486
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:11,562
You have to survive.
That's what my papa says.

487
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:14,649
And so we're leaving
even though it's dangerous.

488
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:17,568
And we are going to survive.

489
01:02:17,652 --> 01:02:21,030
We are Borrowers and we'll make do.
We always have.

490
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:24,492
As long as we have each other to live for,
we'll keep on living.

491
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:30,164
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.

492
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:33,626
I'm actually the one who's going to die.

493
01:02:34,126 --> 01:02:35,503
What?

494
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:40,550
There's something wrong with my heart.

495
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:42,635
They're gonna operate next week

496
01:02:43,052 --> 01:02:44,762
but it probably won't help.

497
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:46,264
That's terrible.

498
01:02:48,641 --> 01:02:51,811
I've always been sick
and I've had someone looking after me.

499
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:54,605
And that's why when I saw you,

500
01:02:54,689 --> 01:02:57,525
I just wanted to find a way to protect you.

501
01:02:57,608 --> 01:03:00,236
But I guess I messed up.

502
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,613
I made it worse. I'm sorry.

503
01:03:04,532 --> 01:03:07,159
And I'm sorry to hear about your heart.

504
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:33,936
Now what on earth is this doing here?

505
01:04:00,046 --> 01:04:03,924
Now how did you get in there?

506
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:22,526
There you are!

507
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,030
Mom!

508
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:29,659
What? What's wrong?

509
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:32,828
My mother, I think she's in danger.

510
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:45,424
No!

511
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,975
Give me that, you little thief!

512
01:05:04,193 --> 01:05:07,154
Now we'll see who they call crazy.

513
01:05:07,988 --> 01:05:11,826
And I bet there's more of you,
aren't there?

514
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:16,038
Wait, no! Wait, wait! Wait!

515
01:05:33,514 --> 01:05:34,640
I have to go help her.

516
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:37,184
But...

517
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:04,044
Oh, no! Help! No, no, please! Help!

518
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:06,088
Pod! Arrietty!

519
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:11,385
Let me out of here!

520
01:06:20,311 --> 01:06:22,062
Hey! Hey!

521
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:25,900
Hey! Hey! Let me out of here!

522
01:06:26,192 --> 01:06:28,486
Arrietty! Help!

523
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:33,866
Watch it!

524
01:06:48,923 --> 01:06:50,591
Let's see.

525
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,933
Now to find the others.

526
01:06:59,517 --> 01:07:01,811
Let me out! No! No!

527
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:35,970
Something terrible has happened.

528
01:09:01,263 --> 01:09:03,599
- Squeaky Klean.
- Yes, hello.

529
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:06,101
I'm calling from 833 Elm Lane.

530
01:09:06,185 --> 01:09:08,103
Could you get out here right away?

531
01:09:08,395 --> 01:09:11,440
I have a very unique pest problem.

532
01:09:11,523 --> 01:09:14,610
- Is <i>it mice?</i>
- Oh, much worse than mice.

533
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:17,154
<i>Do you want them exterminated?</i>

534
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:19,949
No, I need you to trap them.

535
01:09:31,085 --> 01:09:32,920
Shawn! Shawn! Shawn!

536
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:36,340
Shawn! Shawn!

537
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:37,675
Arrietty!

538
01:09:43,472 --> 01:09:45,015
My mother is missing.

539
01:09:45,474 --> 01:09:49,103
Someone took the roof off!
I think a human bean got her.

540
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:56,527
Oh, Mama.

541
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:08,914
We will find her.

542
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:42,823
What?

543
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:45,868
Someone's locked us in.

544
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:52,374
There's a room next door. Hold on tight.

545
01:10:59,131 --> 01:11:00,758
One step at a time.

546
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:01,967
Right.

547
01:11:11,602 --> 01:11:12,728
It's stuck!

548
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,271
Wait.

549
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:25,616
I can get us in.

550
01:11:49,807 --> 01:11:51,391
Oh, no, no!

551
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,194
Keep going.

552
01:12:37,813 --> 01:12:40,065
What do you mean you're lost?

553
01:12:40,649 --> 01:12:43,026
How can you possibly be lost?

554
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:44,653
It's the only road!

555
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:48,282
<i>- Is it before the bridge?
- What bridge? There's no bridge!</i>

556
01:12:55,998 --> 01:12:57,791
Hara must have found it
and opened it.

557
01:12:57,875 --> 01:12:59,459
This is what I was afraid of.

558
01:12:59,543 --> 01:13:01,128
Mother's been taken.

559
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:39,541
Are you okay?

560
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:42,294
Be careful. Shawn, please.

561
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:52,179
Where are those idiots?

562
01:14:26,338 --> 01:14:29,049
Mother! Where are you?

563
01:14:29,925 --> 01:14:33,262
Be wise.
They're supposed to catch pests.

564
01:14:45,065 --> 01:14:47,317
But... HOW did you...

565
01:14:47,401 --> 01:14:48,694
Hara.

566
01:14:51,113 --> 01:14:53,282
Could I have some warm milk?

567
01:14:53,365 --> 01:14:55,742
Okay! Wait just a minute.

568
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:07,296
Thank you, Hara.

569
01:15:45,334 --> 01:15:48,003
I'm a little hungry.
Are there any cookies?

570
01:15:48,086 --> 01:15:51,006
Cookies? Now he wants cookies.

571
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:56,094
Mother!

572
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,097
Mother!

573
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:08,065
Mother!

574
01:16:08,148 --> 01:16:09,399
Arrietty!

575
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:14,654
Over here!

576
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:18,700
Arrietty! Here I am! Here I am!

577
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:20,535
Oh, Mother!

578
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:25,374
Oh, Arrietty.

579
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:54,778
Oh, good. There they are.

580
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:57,697
They finally found the road.
The only road.

581
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:20,595
Another bean!

582
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:26,184
It's okay, Mother. He's a friend.

583
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:51,418
Ma'am, we'd like to take a look around.

584
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:52,669
See what we see.

585
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:54,254
Yes, of course.

586
01:18:18,445 --> 01:18:21,448
Squeaky Klean Exterminators?

587
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:23,783
Hara? Hara!

588
01:18:24,618 --> 01:18:25,660
Oh!

589
01:18:26,912 --> 01:18:28,663
What's going on here?

590
01:18:28,747 --> 01:18:30,665
It's finally happened.

591
01:18:30,749 --> 01:18:32,709
I found the little people.

592
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:34,211
Little people?

593
01:18:35,337 --> 01:18:38,757
Yes! And what little robbers they are.

594
01:18:51,061 --> 01:18:52,646
I wouldn't have believed it either

595
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:55,899
unless I'd seen it with my own eyes.
It's remarkable!

596
01:18:55,982 --> 01:18:58,777
It's the eighth wonder of the world.

597
01:18:59,486 --> 01:19:02,113
And they're so teeny!

598
01:19:02,197 --> 01:19:05,492
And they have a whole house
full of things they've stolen.

599
01:19:05,951 --> 01:19:08,036
Are you sure
you didn't find the sherry again?

600
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:11,581
All these years
you thought I was losing things.

601
01:19:11,665 --> 01:19:14,167
But it wasn't me. It was them!

602
01:19:14,251 --> 01:19:17,462
You didn't mention little people
to the exterminators, did you?

603
01:19:17,546 --> 01:19:19,631
No. I didn't want to scare them off.

604
01:19:19,714 --> 01:19:22,175
Because I'm sure
the house is just full of them.

605
01:19:23,969 --> 01:19:26,263
You'll see when I show you.

606
01:19:26,638 --> 01:19:29,015
This is their nest.

607
01:19:30,892 --> 01:19:33,520
Nest?

608
01:19:38,066 --> 01:19:40,902
Looks like a pile of old junk to me.

609
01:19:40,986 --> 01:19:42,862
What?

610
01:19:43,572 --> 01:19:45,865
It was here! It was here!

611
01:19:47,534 --> 01:19:48,952
Where's that little teapot?

612
01:19:49,035 --> 01:19:51,955
Okay, Hara,
I'm sending the exterminators away.

613
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:54,291
No! No, no! Wait just a minute.

614
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:57,711
Oh. Oh! I'll clean that up later.

615
01:19:59,921 --> 01:20:02,173
Oh, please!

616
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:08,597
Hello, Shawn.
Can we come in for a minute?

617
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,723
It's open.

618
01:20:20,609 --> 01:20:24,487
You'll see.
Those little thieves stole the tiny kitchen.

619
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:29,868
I don't know how they did it,
but the whole thing is gone.

620
01:20:32,746 --> 01:20:33,913
Not gone.

621
01:20:33,997 --> 01:20:36,333
Perhaps you need a little time off, Hara.

622
01:20:37,959 --> 01:20:40,503
Yeah.

623
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,598
Wait! Wait! I can prove it!

624
01:20:51,681 --> 01:20:53,808
I've got one of them in a jar!

625
01:20:56,394 --> 01:21:00,273
Poor Hara.
I think she's finally gone bonkers.

626
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:05,862
Do I smell fresh herbs?

627
01:21:18,917 --> 01:21:22,504
Someone's been making tea.

628
01:21:24,464 --> 01:21:26,466
It's just as my father told us.

629
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:28,843
There really are little people living here.

630
01:21:32,138 --> 01:21:33,348
Yes, there are.

631
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,559
Your mother really
should be here to see this.

632
01:21:36,643 --> 01:21:39,562
She waited so long
for some proof of them.

633
01:21:39,646 --> 01:21:41,731
But they're not thieves like Hara said.

634
01:21:41,815 --> 01:21:43,066
They're just Borrowers.

635
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:44,401
What?

636
01:21:45,026 --> 01:21:47,737
I mean, they must be very frightened.

637
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:52,367
I just hope they're still here.

638
01:21:57,372 --> 01:21:58,707
I hope so, too.

639
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:15,348
Excuse me. Ma'am!

640
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:18,059
Where would you like us
to start looking?

641
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:28,486
Oh, are you all right?

642
01:22:31,072 --> 01:22:33,074
Where did she go?

643
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:36,035
Who took my lady?

644
01:22:36,327 --> 01:22:38,872
There are little people! There are!

645
01:22:38,955 --> 01:22:40,165
Easy, 68$)'

646
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:43,293
And, no, I'm not losing my mind!

647
01:22:58,475 --> 01:23:01,186
If I collapse, leave me behind.

648
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:02,937
With my tea kettle.

649
01:23:03,354 --> 01:23:07,233
You're doing great. It's just
a little further until we break for food.

650
01:23:08,318 --> 01:23:09,986
Can't we just head back?

651
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:13,156
We can live with the rats
in the compost heap.

652
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:16,159
Oh, no!

653
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:29,923
Let's hurry.

654
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:32,675
I can't do it.

655
01:23:59,077 --> 01:24:01,246
Arrietty, you really
should eat something.

656
01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:03,873
We're gonna be walking
at least until morning.

657
01:24:03,957 --> 01:24:05,124
What?

658
01:24:07,168 --> 01:24:08,753
I'm so sorry.

659
01:24:09,838 --> 01:24:11,923
I feel like maybe it's all my fault

660
01:24:12,006 --> 01:24:14,926
that we had to leave
such a wonderful house.

661
01:24:18,513 --> 01:24:20,139
That's in the past.

662
01:24:21,432 --> 01:24:25,395
We'll make another wonderful house,
the three of us, together.

663
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:33,194
I'm going outside for a bit.

664
01:24:33,987 --> 01:24:36,322
Arrietty, don't go too far.

665
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:13,359
Niya.

666
01:26:23,721 --> 01:26:25,014
Niya.

667
01:26:43,783 --> 01:26:45,326
Just a little further.

668
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,600
Spiller!

669
01:27:24,407 --> 01:27:26,034
That's the last of it.

670
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:29,495
Come on, we should keep moving.

671
01:27:29,829 --> 01:27:31,247
Okay.

672
01:27:35,668 --> 01:27:37,670
Mother, are you all right?

673
01:27:49,891 --> 01:27:51,267
Arrietty!

674
01:27:51,601 --> 01:27:52,894
Arrietty!

675
01:28:21,798 --> 01:28:22,965
Shawn.

676
01:28:26,928 --> 01:28:28,221
Arrietty.

677
01:28:45,238 --> 01:28:46,948
We have to leave.

678
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:49,450
But Spiller says there's more of us
not too far from here.

679
01:28:49,534 --> 01:28:51,410
A two-day's journey, at most.

680
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:53,955
He thinks it might be my mother's family.

681
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:56,457
You won't be the last of your kind.

682
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:58,042
But how did you find me?

683
01:29:00,711 --> 01:29:02,588
Niya here showed me the way.

684
01:29:10,179 --> 01:29:13,015
Thank you, Niya. Take care of him.

685
01:29:19,397 --> 01:29:20,773
I brought you something.

686
01:29:26,571 --> 01:29:30,324
Now think of it as a gift
from one friend to another.

687
01:29:35,788 --> 01:29:37,290
Thank you, Shawn.

688
01:29:51,262 --> 01:29:53,139
I have to go.

689
01:29:54,891 --> 01:29:56,642
When is your operation?

690
01:29:57,476 --> 01:30:00,396
Tomorrow. But I'm not scared.

691
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:03,065
Because someone taught me
how to be brave.

692
01:30:11,949 --> 01:30:13,618
So you'll remember me.

693
01:30:18,915 --> 01:30:20,625
How can I forget you?

694
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:29,634
You protected me after all.

695
01:30:31,594 --> 01:30:33,429
Arrietty.

696
01:30:35,973 --> 01:30:38,851
I hope you have a happy life.

697
01:30:40,853 --> 01:30:42,396
Goodbye, Shawn.

698
01:30:46,567 --> 01:30:50,780
Arrietty, my heart is strong now
because you're in it.

699
01:30:51,364 --> 01:30:53,407
And you always will be.

700
01:30:53,491 --> 01:30:54,784
Forever.

701
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:04,543
<i>I never saw her again.</i>

702
01:31:06,212 --> 01:31:08,464
<i>But the following summer I returned</i>

703
01:31:08,547 --> 01:31:11,425
<i>and was happy to hear
the people in the house down the road</i>

704
01:31:13,594 --> 01:31:15,471
<i>talking about how many things
in their home had gone</i>

705
01:31:15,554 --> 01:31:16,889
<i>missing.</i>

706
01:31:16,973 --> 01:31:21,227
<i>I'm 14 years old, I am pretty</i>

707
01:31:22,311 --> 01:31:27,525
<i>I'm a teeny tiny girl, a little lady</i>

708
01:31:29,193 --> 01:31:32,822
<i>I live under the kitchen floor</i>

709
01:31:35,032 --> 01:31:39,912
<i>Right here, not so far from you</i>

710
01:31:42,123 --> 01:31:47,837
<i>Sometimes I feel happy,
sometimes I feel blue</i>

711
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:52,174
<i>In my dreams, oh, I wish I could</i>

712
01:31:52,258 --> 01:31:55,052
<i>Feel my hair blowing in the wind</i>

713
01:31:55,136 --> 01:31:58,347
<i>See the sky and the summer rain</i>

714
01:31:58,431 --> 01:32:02,143
<i>Pick a flower from the garden for you</i>

715
01:32:03,602 --> 01:32:06,355
<i>Now I know there's another world</i>

716
01:32:06,439 --> 01:32:09,692
<i>Butterﬂies floating in the air</i>

717
01:32:09,775 --> 01:32:14,030
<i>There is someone out there for me</i>

718
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:58,199
<i>Walking down, picket fence</i>

719
01:32:58,282 --> 01:33:00,409
<i>Run my hands along the edge</i>

720
01:33:00,493 --> 01:33:03,412
<i>And music plays in my head</i>

721
01:33:03,496 --> 01:33:05,539
<i>Hear the song before I go to bed</i>

722
01:33:05,623 --> 01:33:08,667
<i>When stars are bright
outside my window</i>

723
01:33:08,751 --> 01:33:11,253
<i>Wake up to tree boughs
filled up with snow</i>

724
01:33:11,337 --> 01:33:13,839
<i>And I remember Oh, I remember</i>

725
01:33:13,923 --> 01:33:16,258
<i>I remember my summer with you</i>

726
01:33:16,342 --> 01:33:18,928
<i>Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes</i>

727
01:33:19,011 --> 01:33:22,264
<i>Rolled down windows
Hold my hand, hold me close</i>

728
01:33:22,348 --> 01:33:26,685
<i>Pick up your phone
Wanna hear your voice again</i>

729
01:33:26,769 --> 01:33:30,064
<i>Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair</i>

730
01:33:30,147 --> 01:33:32,691
<i>I like you, I don't care</i>

731
01:33:32,775 --> 01:33:35,903
<i>Why did it have to end?</i>

732
01:33:37,196 --> 01:33:40,199
<i>Summer love with my best friend</i>

733
01:33:40,282 --> 01:33:45,454
<i>I'd fly to you
All the way across the states</i>

734
01:33:45,538 --> 01:33:49,959
<i>I'd fly to you
Hear me, the winter day</i>

735
01:33:50,042 --> 01:33:56,549
<i>Oh, I'd follow the sun
and come right to your door</i>

736
01:33:58,217 --> 01:34:00,678
<i>I remember my summer with you</i>

737
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:03,389
<i>Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes</i>

738
01:34:03,472 --> 01:34:06,600
<i>Rolled down windows
Hold my hand, hold me close</i>

739
01:34:06,684 --> 01:34:11,021
<i>Pick up your phone
Wanna hear your voice again</i>

740
01:34:11,105 --> 01:34:14,400
<i>Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair</i>

741
01:34:14,483 --> 01:34:17,027
<i>I like you, I don't care</i>

742
01:34:17,111 --> 01:34:20,197
<i>Why did it have to end?</i>

743
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:25,077
<i>Summer love with my best friend</i>

744
01:34:26,871 --> 01:34:29,999
<i>I will miss you in summer again when</i>

745
01:34:37,423 --> 01:34:40,134
<i>I will miss you in summer again when</i>
