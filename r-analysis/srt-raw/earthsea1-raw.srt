7
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,574
Ease the sail!

8
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,378
It's blowing too hard!

9
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:57,556
Curse it! A storm this time of year?
Where's my Weatherworker?

10
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:03,121
What are you waiting for?
Calm the waves before we sink!

11
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,126
What's wrong?

12
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:10,191
Captain... I can't remember them.

13
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,795
I can't remember the True Names
of wind and waves.

14
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,302
What? Are you mad?

15
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,604
Captain!

16
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,042
There's something above the clouds!

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,910
Where?

18
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,518
What is that?

19
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,344
A dragon!
What is it doing here?

20
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,177
There's another one!

21
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,117
Dragons fighting? That's impossible!

22
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:03,114
More than 2, 000 sheep
have taken the fever in Enlad alone.

23
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,108
Half of them have died.

24
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,818
Seven hundred cattle
have been infected.

25
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,117
We've lost 50 head so far.

26
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:16,985
In fact, a baby on Taon
has also come down with the fever.

27
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,522
Silence!

28
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,133
If we panic,
what will become of the People?

29
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,269
Seal off the affected areas.

30
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:31,639
Send every healer
in the kingdom to find a cure.

31
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,913
Send provisions
to those who need them.

32
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,814
Wizard Root!
Find out what's behind this.

33
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,652
Your Majesty.

34
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,452
And the drought
in the provinces?

35
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,087
We sent Weatherworkers
but the results were disappointing.

36
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,100
Soon it may be too late
for the spring planting.

37
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:00,566
Why have these misfortunes
befallen us, Root?

38
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,608
I sense the Light dimming,
Your Majesty.

39
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,242
The Light?

40
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:09,145
The Light of the Balance
that sustains the world.

41
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,273
Your Majesty!

42
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,815
What now?

43
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,509
Terrible news!

44
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,646
Dragons have been sighted
off the coast!

45
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,655
- Dragons?
- Two, Majesty. One was killed.

46
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:26,856
Dragons here, in the East?
Can this really be true?

47
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,563
Long ago, dragons
and men were one.

48
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:36,671
But men who coveted possessions
chose the land and the sea.

49
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,610
Dragons who wanted freedom,
chose wind and fire.

50
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,848
Since then, dragons and men
remained apart.

51
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:49,283
To hear that dragons have been seen,
and were even fighting...

52
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,524
The twilight that threatens
us is ever deepening.

53
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:01,461
Bring the captain to me.
I would hear more of this.

54
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,670
Root, I want you there too.

55
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,509
Please... Your Majesty!

56
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,737
- We'll get in trouble!
- I have to!

57
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:16,246
- What is it?
- Have you seen Prince Arren?

58
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,509
He's been gone since last night.

59
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,151
Prince Arren? Gone?

60
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,516
That's enough.

61
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,057
His Majesty is occupied.

62
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,593
Surely you can see that.

63
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,100
Forgive me.

64
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,660
It's just... he seems so sad lately.
We were worried.

65
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,667
That's absurd!
Arren is 17, not a child.

66
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,474
Forgive this disturbance, Your Majesty.

67
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,516
Your people are more important.

68
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,176
- Very well, then.
- Your Majesty.

69
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,486
I must tend
to my correspondence.

70
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,924
We await your command, sire.

71
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,202
I'm imagining things.

72
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,130
Arren!

73
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,948
So you are my death...

74
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,257
Are you hurt?

75
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,046
Steady there, lad!

76
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,404
Is this what you seek?

77
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,577
This is dangerous country
for travelers.

78
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,414
You were lucky this time.
You must be hungry.

79
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,448
It's not much,
but you're welcome to it.

80
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,653
What is your name, lad?

81
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,189
My name is Arren.

82
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:11,567
Arren, is it?
It means sword, doesn't it?

83
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,438
So you hail from Enlad.

84
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,611
How did you know?

85
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,439
That blade
was forged with magic.

86
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,450
I doubt you could unsheathe it.

87
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,128
What is it?

88
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,762
It's nothing.

89
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,444
Arren?

90
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,647
If you have nowhere to go,
why not come with me?

91
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,416
I doubt our meeting here
was an accident.

92
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,486
And I'd welcome
a companion on the road.

93
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,797
Arren! Are you coming?

94
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,800
What should I call you?

95
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,310
Call me Sparrowhawk.

96
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,744
Another abandoned farm.
Farmers leaving their land...

97
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,911
There's more to this
than poor harvests.

98
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,749
Come, Arren.
We'd better push on.

99
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,022
Lord Sparrowhawk?

100
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,527
Sparrowhawk will do.
What is it?

101
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,831
Sparrowhawk?

102
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,031
Where are we heading?

103
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:03,037
First. we go to the next town.
But after that...

104
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,376
...even I don't know.

105
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,427
- Getting tired?
- No.

106
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,465
Come along.
We're almost there.

107
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,452
There it is.

108
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,256
Hort Town.

109
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,823
Are they prisoners?

110
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,560
They are slaves.

111
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,326
Here, people are goods
to buy and sell.

112
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,698
Trading in human lives!

113
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,101
Two guineas, gentlemen!
Do I hear two guineas?

114
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,901
I have two guineas!

115
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:20,035
Three! Sold to the gentleman
for three guineas!

116
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:32,186
No, sorry!
Couldn't possibly find room!

117
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,209
Gauzes from Sowl!
Silks from Lorbanery!

118
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,576
Furs and felts and woolens!

119
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,807
Is this a market day?

120
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,078
No. It's like this year round.

121
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,583
Silks and satins!
Canvass and fleecefells!

122
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,753
What can I show you?

123
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,125
This is Lorbanery's finest silk!

124
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,557
Fine as a mayfly's wing!

125
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:18,570
I don't have a wife.
I need a cloak for my friend.

126
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,601
Wizards! No girlfriend, eh?

127
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:27,703
- But I don't need a cloak.
- You can't go about like that.

128
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,808
You should hide
that thing on your belt.

129
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,110
What about this?

130
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,248
Fleece from Gont.
Highest quality.

131
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:40,257
Four warp strings.
This is Andradean work.

132
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,558
On Gont they use six or more.

133
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:49,262
You used to be a sorceress.
Why are you selling fakes?

134
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,070
People don't believe
in foolish tricks any more.

135
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:56,071
My goods are
not what I claim.

136
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,269
But at least they're real...

137
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:03,075
...not mere lies and air
like magic and sorcery!

138
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,180
Sparrowhawk!

139
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,355
Thank you!

140
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,615
What!

141
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:50,486
Unhand me!

142
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,892
Calm yourself, young master.

143
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:00,070
I have something for you.
It's the door to bliss.

144
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,571
What is it?

145
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,068
Hazia, my lord. Ha-zi-a.

146
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,577
Take one.
Leave sorrow and fear behind.

147
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,014
No more sorrow or fear...

148
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:15,576
You'll never be troubled
with the pain of this world again.

149
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:19,412
You needn't pay me.
It's my pleasure.

150
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,424
Arren.

151
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,763
What are you doing?

152
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,560
Is this your friend, my lord?

153
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:34,572
And what about you?
Don't wizards have troubles too?

154
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:39,075
I'm sorry. I have no use
for what you're selling.

155
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,707
Save us from the arrogance
of sorcerers!

156
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,345
I suppose you've lost
your powers too!

157
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:53,857
Hazia is not something
to toy with, Arren. Look!

158
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:58,153
The hazia eater feels
himself in paradise.

159
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:03,462
Then the spirit leaves the body
and wanders aimlessly in darkness.

160
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:08,596
When it returns? More hazia.
And finally, death.

161
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,876
What's the matter?

162
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,654
Feeling better?

163
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,797
The wind is fresh up here.

164
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,896
Something's wrong with this town.

165
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,835
Not only this town, lad.

166
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:44,666
Farmers' crops wither.
Their sheep and cattle are falling sick.

167
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,836
Even people's minds
have lost their way.

168
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,342
Is it some sort of pestilence?

169
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:56,347
No. A pestilence
is how the Balance restores itself.

170
00:20:56,622 --> 00:21:00,353
But this? I fear someone
is trying to destroy the Balance.

171
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:05,254
There's only one creature
in Earthsea capable of such evil.

172
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,828
Only one.

173
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,769
Well then.
Shall we go back to the inn?

174
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,204
I'd like to rest a little longer.

175
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,906
Very well.

176
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,403
I'll be waiting.
Keep your wits about you.

177
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,304
I will.

178
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,928
Slave takers?

179
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,780
A witch, are you?

180
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,113
And an ugly one at that!

181
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,650
Won't fetch much with that face.

182
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:19,062
Just a few guineas.
But we can still have a little fun.

183
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,163
Oww! My finger!

184
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,402
The witch has spirit!

185
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,395
I'm going to enjoy this.

186
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,803
Who's there?

187
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,299
Step forward and show yourself!

188
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,149
Well, well.

189
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,720
What are you
doing here, boy?

190
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,719
Go ahead. Take him!

191
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,391
No hard feelings, boy.
Just following the boss's orders.

192
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,096
I'll make it quick.

193
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,428
Or maybe you'd like to be a slave?

194
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,264
Beg for your life!

195
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,439
Changed your mind?

196
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,682
Life is nothing to me.

197
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,452
So you want a fight, eh?

198
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,487
Draw your sword!

199
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,003
All right. Now it's my turn.

200
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,555
Uh oh.

201
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:01,731
Hold on there son.
You don't care about the girl?

202
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,061
Do it.

203
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,499
If you want her so much,
here she is!

204
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,710
Come on men!
Let's go!

205
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,445
Are you...

206
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,124
Therru!

207
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,261
Therru!

208
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,541
Therru...

209
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:57,678
A bird...

210
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,834
So! We meet again, boy.

211
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,632
Take him!

212
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:29,745
He'll fetch a good price.
Don't be too rough.

213
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,350
Take him away!

214
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:43,888
Just an old piece of junk.
Couldn't give it away!

215
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,530
Give it up, it's no use.

216
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:30,573
Quiet!

217
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:34,270
Silence!
Or I'll feed you to the hounds!

218
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:04,940
Come on!

219
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,800
Get moving!

220
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,311
What's going on?

221
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:13,009
I don't know.
Move, you lazy animals!

222
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,484
Confound it! What's wrong?

223
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,480
Sparrowhawk...

224
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,482
Let's go, Arren.

225
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,988
Can you stand?

226
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,605
What about the others?

227
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,407
I left none bound.
Now it's up to them.

228
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,458
How did you know
where to find me?

229
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:41,204
When you didn't come,
I scoured Hort Town.

230
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:45,942
Finally, someone told me
a young man was taken by slavers.

231
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:50,206
I had to make
a spell of finding.

232
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,710
I am sorry, I was foolish.

233
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,988
No, it was my fault.

234
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,852
I should've been more careful.

235
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,955
I'm sorry.

236
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:08,355
Who's there?

237
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,757
It's me, Sparrowhawk.

238
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,295
Sparrowhawk?

239
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,228
Someone's been hurt.

240
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,831
I'm sorry. It's late.

241
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,841
It's been a long time, Ged.

242
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,322
He's asleep.

243
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,561
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid you've lost your bed.

244
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,931
It's his now.
Here, this will warm you.

245
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,057
Thanks.

246
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,701
You haven't changed.

247
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,846
No.
You're keeping well, Tenar?

248
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,817
I suppose.
It hasn't always been easy.

249
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,850
And you?

250
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,188
Do you still wander?

251
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,349
That was good.

252
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,789
It has been a long time.

253
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,156
Yes, it has.

254
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,898
As Archmage, I have no time...

255
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,792
...to wander as I once did.

256
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:30,098
And what brings the Archmage
so far from home?

257
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,946
Evil tidings come
from every corner of Earthsea.

258
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,374
Things are out of balance...

259
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:43,119
...as if the sun's light
were ebbing.

260
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:47,118
Is the Art Magic ebbing too?

261
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:52,629
Yes. As if our very blood
were flowing from our veins.

262
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,296
So you search for the answer?

263
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,558
Yes.

264
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,405
Oh dear, we woke you up.

265
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:09,412
Come, child. Don't worry.
This man is an old friend of mine.

266
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,580
This is Therru.
She's been with me five years.

267
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,387
Call me Sparrowhawk.
I'm sorry I woke you.

268
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:27,628
Hawk?

269
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:37,500
Well, you should be honored.
Therru never speaks to strangers.

270
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:38,939
What is it?

271
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,946
Could she really be...?

272
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,073
Lord Cob.

273
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,337
Enter.

274
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,810
Forgive my intrusion.
I beg leave to speak.

275
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:57,846
What is it?

276
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:00,924
I'm afraid some
of our slaves escaped.

277
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:05,929
I see. You let
my precious merchandise go.

278
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,630
No. We've captured most of them.

279
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:10,928
And?

280
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,929
What about the others?

281
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,942
We're scouring the countryside.
We'll find them.

282
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,076
You're a fool.

283
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:27,009
Do you think
I can't manage without you?

284
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:36,520
It was a wizard!
A wizard with a scar on his face!

285
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:38,220
What?

286
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,523
A scar on his face?

287
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:47,437
It's Sparrowhawk.
The Archmage pays me a visit.

288
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:51,268
Find him for me,
Hare... or else.

289
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,966
I won't fail you, my lord.

290
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:04,312
I've waited long
for this day... Sparrowhawk.

291
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:43,017
Tenar! I brought the water in!

292
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,623
Where is she?

293
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,357
Tenar? Are you still asleep?

294
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:49,866
Tenar?

295
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:52,558
Are you sick?

296
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,274
Who was that?

297
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,147
It's that girl!

298
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:12,311
That must've been a surprise.
I'm sorry dear. I should've told you.

299
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:15,856
Don't worry. Arren is with me.

300
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,819
You have nothing to fear.

301
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:21,829
Sometimes his eyes are wild,
but he has a good heart.

302
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:27,567
Good morning.

303
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:30,571
Good morning.

304
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,904
I'm done eating!

305
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,376
Well!

306
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:39,345
Did you sleep well?
How do you feel?

307
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,716
I'm all right.

308
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,579
I didn't do anything to her.

309
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,823
Of course you didn't.
Come have breakfast.

310
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,256
Can't work if you don't eat.

311
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,097
Work?

312
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,222
Ouch...

313
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,796
Are you getting blisters?

314
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,065
Yes.

315
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,794
Shall we rest a bit?

316
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,570
What a good smell.

317
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,576
- But...
- Yes, lad?

318
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,809
You're a wizard, aren't you?

319
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,412
Oh, I see.

320
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:54,390
You want to know why a wizard
toils in the field like a farmer?

321
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,459
Yes.

322
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,058
Listen, Arren.

323
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:02,963
Everything under the sun
and stars depends on the Balance.

324
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:08,465
The wind and seas.
The power of earth and light.

325
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:15,273
All that these do is well
and rightly done within the Equilibrium.

326
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,615
But now, men hold
the power to control the world.

327
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:24,048
So Man must learn
to keep the Balance...

328
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:28,990
...and do what leaf and whale
and wind do of their own nature.

329
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,890
You know everything
has its True Name.

330
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:38,965
Magic is the power to command,
if you know a thing's True Name.

331
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:44,036
Use that power in ignorance
and the Balance is easily damaged.

332
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:47,304
Spells should be made
only of necessity.

333
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,138
You've been busy.

334
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:53,014
I suppose you two
deserve some lunch.

335
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,121
Are you feeling better, Arren?

336
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:02,815
Now eat hearty,
or you won't get your strength back.

337
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,252
What about the girl?

338
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,660
Oh, Therru?

339
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,598
One of the spring lambs is sick.

340
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,060
She's nursing it today.

341
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,868
Shall we change places?

342
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,704
No, I can manage.

343
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,090
- How did it go?
- That's it for today.

344
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,686
Dinner will be ready soon.
Better wash up.

345
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,296
- I'll put the ox in the stable.
- Thanks, lad.

346
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:02,182
There, you should be feeling better.
Now you need your mother's milk.

347
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,690
That's it.

348
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,695
Good girl.

349
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,138
What do you want?

350
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,772
Oh... nothing.

351
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,676
Why did you come here?

352
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:31,145
To hurt me?
To kill this little one?

353
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:34,106
You don't understand!
I was just...

354
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,947
Stay away! Get out of here!

355
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,959
I hate anyone who doesn't value life!

356
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,021
I'm sorry.

357
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,629
Step aside!

358
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,774
Let's eat.

359
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,945
It's so good having men
to help with the farm.

360
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,049
Even you two.

361
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:14,147
I'm no good with a plow,
but I do know animals.

362
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:17,523
You used to be a goatherd.

363
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,794
What's wrong, Arren?
Aren't you hungry?

364
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:26,628
No.

365
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,474
What is this place?

366
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,033
Come, Arren. This way.

367
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:32,397
Sparrowhawk?

368
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:45,672
Come. Take my hand.

369
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,121
Arren!

370
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,814
No! Leave me alone! Stop!

371
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,663
Arren!

372
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,975
Arren! Wake up!

373
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:15,571
Arren!

374
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:23,644
What's wrong?

375
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,288
A bad dream, I think.

376
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:27,917
A dream...

377
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:42,334
Spring is very short, you know.
I need all the help I can get.

378
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:46,837
I'm sorry, Tenar.
I have an errand that cannot wait.

379
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,837
I still can't rely on you.

380
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,039
Come now, Tenar.

381
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,845
Should you be taking Arren's horse?

382
00:45:56,453 --> 00:46:00,981
He's better off without it.
Tell him I borrowed it.

383
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:05,360
Tenar. Keep a close eye
on him for me.

384
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:08,362
I promise.

385
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:11,998
I'll be back tonight!
And back at work tomorrow!

386
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:14,927
I certainly hope so.

387
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,150
Haven't seen him around here.

388
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:40,355
And that scar!

389
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,989
He must've come
from that woman's house.

390
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,695
She's a witch.
I don't like the looks of it.

391
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:52,140
Yes, she's an odd one.
And that little girl she keeps!

392
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,004
That child will bring
bad luck on us all.

393
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:59,276
No! Don't say that out loud!

394
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,519
Who was that?

395
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:07,715
He's not from around here.

396
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,656
He's a friend of ours.

397
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,551
He's helping us out.

398
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,254
Is that so?

399
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:14,955
Can I help you?

400
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:19,660
My child has a fever ma'am.
I need that potion again.

401
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,998
All right. Just wait there.

402
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,302
Quit sticking to me!

403
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,208
I'm afraid!

404
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:33,674
Spare us from evil!

405
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,411
That's enough!

406
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:40,046
There. If the child's not better,
come see me again.

407
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,919
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

408
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,060
Actually, I was wondering...

409
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:49,197
Yes, I know.
Pay me when you can.

410
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:52,095
Thanks ma'am. You're very kind.

411
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:56,396
Hope she feels better!

412
00:47:56,506 --> 00:48:00,203
I wish there were more
decent people in the world.

413
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,870
Therru never hurt anyone.

414
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:08,080
Well, at least the woman
looks after her own.

415
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:14,714
As for Therru, her parents
abused and abandoned her.

416
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:19,592
They burned her.
That's how she got that scar.

417
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,996
What a frightful child!

418
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,631
My goodness!
Did you see her eyes?

419
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,848
Please, have mercy!

420
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,647
No one will buy
an old woman!

421
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:22,791
Nothing to fear ladies.
Maybe you can even help me.

422
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,959
Seen any strangers around here?
Be much obliged for any help.

423
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,726
And I'll pay.

424
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,264
There's one at Tenar's farm!

425
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:37,135
And one with a scar
on his face!

426
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,203
Tenar? Who's that?

427
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,005
The witch! She lives
right up this road.

428
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,804
Thanks for the help, old hags!

429
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,951
Wait! Where are you going?

430
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:55,757
Stop! Liar!
You promised to pay!

431
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,658
There it is! That's it!

432
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:09,863
What's that?

433
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,470
What are you doing?

434
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:23,777
You're looking fit, boy.
Didn't think I'd find you here.

435
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,550
Swine!
What are you doing here?

436
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:31,717
Now, now. I'm not here to fight.
Where's your wizard friend?

437
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:35,229
He's gone!
Sparrowhawk's not here.

438
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:38,466
You'd better not be hiding him.

439
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,696
Why should I?

440
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:43,471
You're no match for him.

441
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:49,041
Looks like she's telling the truth.
All right, we'll be back!

442
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,605
Till then!

443
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,819
Never come back, you swine!

444
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,820
Lord Cob will reward me for this!

445
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:20,508
So that's what happened.

446
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:23,544
Neither of you
said a word about it.

447
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:28,450
I think we fixed most of it.

448
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:29,780
Let's rebuild the fence.

449
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:37,819
Tenar? Have you known
Sparrowhawk for a long time?

450
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,227
Yes, I guess I have.
A long, long time.

451
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,760
He's always been a wanderer.

452
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:51,668
It's the life he chose.
He does it because he has to.

453
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:56,735
And finally he became Archmage,
the greatest of all wizards.

454
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,816
Head of the Great House of Roke?

455
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:03,682
Yes. But years before that,
he rescued me.

456
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,687
Rescued me, and
led me into the light.

457
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:18,064
One man, all alone.

458
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:24,497
He brought me out
of the Tombs of Atuan.

459
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,190
Welcome.

460
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:49,088
Don't get many wizards.
Looking for a weapon?

461
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,190
Show me that sword.

462
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,538
Can't recommend this one.

463
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:00,235
Very unusual workmanship,
so I bought it.

464
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,676
But it's rusted solid.
Can't be drawn.

465
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,649
You there, wizard!

466
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,054
Are you deaf?
I'm talking to you!

467
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,792
You said something, sir?

468
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,535
Is there something
stuck to my face?

469
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,633
Wrong wizard!

470
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:32,834
You! If you see a wizard
with a scar on his face...

471
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:35,969
...tell him Lord Cob
wants to see him!

472
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:40,747
Cob? Never heard that name
back where I come from.

473
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,179
You will, when he's Lord
of the Two Lands!

474
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:46,687
Don't forget it!

475
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,390
Yes sir.

476
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,254
I'll take the sword.
How much?

477
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,761
Wait a minute... your face!

478
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,266
What's wrong?

479
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,427
Nothing... I suppose.

480
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:04,006
Have you heard of
this wizard named Cob?

481
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:07,141
Careful! Keep your voice down.

482
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:12,612
Only wizard in these parts
who still has his powers.

483
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:16,482
Can't say he's loved
by people around here.

484
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,989
He lives in the fortress outside town.
Best keep away from there.

485
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:28,294
I never thought
I'd find you here, Cob.

486
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:40,238
You're good at farm work.
You hardly seem a beginner.

487
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,311
Thank you.

488
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:46,246
Won't you stay on
for a while and help?

489
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,408
Therru would like that too.

490
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:49,348
But...

491
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:53,252
You don't have to decide now.
Think about it, all right?

492
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:54,482
All right.

493
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,192
Stable the ox for me.

494
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,522
Yes, Tenar.

495
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:03,960
I'm home!

496
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:08,636
Therru? Now where is she?

497
00:55:14,361 --> 00:55:18,889
Arren! I can't find Therru.
Check the back pasture for me.

498
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,966
Tell her to come inside
before dark.

499
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,403
I will.

500
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,410
Therru?

501
00:55:47,827 --> 00:55:48,521
Therru...

502
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:54,928
<i>Far, far above the clouds
against the setting sun</i>

503
00:55:55,335 --> 00:56:02,298
<i>A falcon flies alone
soaring in the wind</i>

504
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:09,510
<i>I hear his lonely cry
so sad must he be</i>

505
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:16,219
<i>Riding the silent wind
a falcon flies alone</i>

506
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:23,589
<i>Reaching out with his wings
grasps the empty sky</i>

507
00:56:23,897 --> 00:56:30,700
<i>Riding the silent wind
never can he rest</i>

508
00:56:32,772 --> 00:56:39,200
<i>What it is within my heart
none can ever know</i>

509
00:56:39,779 --> 00:56:46,150
<i>A heart like a falcon's
is this very heart</i>

510
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:53,120
<i>What it is within my heart
none can ever know</i>

511
00:56:53,460 --> 00:57:00,798
<i>Lonely falcon in the empty sky</i>

512
00:57:02,635 --> 00:57:09,040
<i>I walk alone along
deserted country roads</i>

513
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:16,044
<i>Walking with me side by side
you are always there</i>

514
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:23,346
<i>I feel your loneliness
lonely you must be</i>

515
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:30,193
<i>Crickets whispering
in the grassy fields</i>

516
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:37,231
<i>You walk there by my side
you walk the path with me</i>

517
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:44,670
<i>But you never say a word
never do you speak</i>

518
00:57:46,746 --> 00:57:53,310
<i>What it is within my heart
none can ever know</i>

519
00:57:53,853 --> 00:58:00,452
<i>Here inside this heart
that walks its path alone</i>

520
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:07,229
<i>What it is within my heart
none can ever know</i>

521
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:14,769
<i>The sadness of one
who always is alone</i>

522
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,294
I killed my father.

523
00:58:37,897 --> 00:58:40,593
I stabbed him and ran away.

524
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,531
I don't understand it.
Why did I kill him?

525
00:58:45,238 --> 00:58:47,138
Did he hurt you?

526
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,769
No. My father
was a great man.

527
00:58:51,377 --> 00:58:56,178
I am nothing. I failed my father
and I fail myself.

528
00:58:56,816 --> 00:59:01,947
And yet, I'm filled
with a rage I can't control.

529
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:07,089
It's as if there were
someone else inside me.

530
00:59:07,193 --> 00:59:09,218
You saw it too, didn't you?

531
00:59:10,029 --> 00:59:13,396
You were right.
I shouldn't be here.

532
00:59:13,766 --> 00:59:15,324
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

533
00:59:15,435 --> 00:59:17,403
No, you were right.

534
00:59:19,038 --> 00:59:22,633
If I don't leave,
it will come again.

535
00:59:35,254 --> 00:59:36,186
A woman?

536
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:38,951
She lives past the marshes.

537
00:59:40,259 --> 00:59:42,955
And the Archmage is with her?

538
00:59:43,429 --> 00:59:47,957
He was seen in the town.
There are many witnesses.

539
00:59:48,601 --> 00:59:50,091
Splendid.

540
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,704
My lord.

541
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,675
Let's go, men!

542
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:26,994
A greeting from the Archmage.
Thank you, Sparrowhawk.

543
01:00:42,121 --> 01:00:45,113
Therru! Arren!
Dinner is ready!

544
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,189
Where's Arren?

545
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,051
Isn't he with you?

546
01:00:50,163 --> 01:00:51,130
No.

547
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:55,724
Maybe he's resting.
Therru, go see if he's there.

548
01:00:55,835 --> 01:00:56,995
Yes, Tenar.

549
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:01,734
He's not here.

550
01:01:02,508 --> 01:01:05,477
That's strange.
Where's he gone?

551
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:07,737
I'll look outside.

552
01:01:25,031 --> 01:01:26,396
Arren...

553
01:01:41,013 --> 01:01:43,880
Tenar, Therru... take care.

554
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,966
Doesn't matter
which way I go.

555
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:25,155
Looks like a dead end.

556
01:02:45,778 --> 01:02:47,006
It's here!

557
01:04:02,555 --> 01:04:04,352
I wonder if that's Arren?

558
01:04:06,893 --> 01:04:08,121
Arren?

559
01:04:08,995 --> 01:04:10,394
Sparrowhawk?

560
01:04:18,004 --> 01:04:19,665
That's odd.

561
01:04:20,373 --> 01:04:21,931
What are you doing?

562
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,167
It's you! You're back!

563
01:04:25,878 --> 01:04:30,315
So sorry, but it seems
you'll do in place of the wizard.

564
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:31,110
What?

565
01:04:31,217 --> 01:04:32,650
Tenar, what's wrong?

566
01:04:32,752 --> 01:04:33,616
Run away!

567
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:35,311
What a surprise!

568
01:04:35,421 --> 01:04:38,788
Fancy meeting you here, princess.

569
01:04:41,227 --> 01:04:43,320
No! Leave her alone!

570
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:52,237
Therru!

571
01:04:54,206 --> 01:04:57,232
Well now princess,
where's your prince?

572
01:04:57,543 --> 01:04:59,135
Hey! Watch those teeth!

573
01:04:59,578 --> 01:05:04,140
I need you to deliver a message.
Tell this to the wizard!

574
01:05:04,784 --> 01:05:06,911
If he wants his woman...

575
01:05:07,019 --> 01:05:11,046
...he can find her
at Lord Cob's castle.

576
01:05:12,091 --> 01:05:13,058
Take her away!

577
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,023
Therru!

578
01:05:14,126 --> 01:05:15,889
Tenar!

579
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:20,788
Let me go, I tell you!
Let me go!

580
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:28,032
Therru!
Are you all right? Therru!

581
01:05:28,274 --> 01:05:30,367
Stop it! Let her go!

582
01:05:30,476 --> 01:05:35,470
You stay here and be good
till the wizard gets back!

583
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:39,515
Lord Cob's waiting.
Let's get moving!

584
01:05:43,656 --> 01:05:45,248
Tenar!

585
01:05:47,126 --> 01:05:48,923
Tenar!

586
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:24,058
I'm sorry. I'm afraid
he's coming with me.

587
01:06:29,468 --> 01:06:30,298
Go!

588
01:06:57,329 --> 01:06:58,557
Where am I?

589
01:06:59,865 --> 01:07:04,461
You're safe now.
The Shadow can't follow you here.

590
01:07:04,904 --> 01:07:06,769
You saw it?

591
01:07:07,506 --> 01:07:10,475
I know a bit of Magic myself.

592
01:07:11,177 --> 01:07:13,771
I know what
you're running from.

593
01:07:14,413 --> 01:07:17,940
You were wise
to flee from that man.

594
01:07:18,484 --> 01:07:19,974
What man?

595
01:07:20,086 --> 01:07:23,954
Sparrowhawk.
That is, the Archmage.

596
01:07:25,024 --> 01:07:28,858
Here, drink this.
It will soothe you.

597
01:07:33,265 --> 01:07:36,757
What's wrong?
It's not poisoned.

598
01:07:51,383 --> 01:07:55,251
Now lie still
and rest here for a bit.

599
01:07:55,554 --> 01:07:59,854
The Archmage is more dangerous
than you can imagine.

600
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:03,428
No... Sparrowhawk is a good man.

601
01:08:03,529 --> 01:08:05,861
He protected me.

602
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:11,232
Then tell me. Did you ever
wonder what he seeks?

603
01:08:14,106 --> 01:08:15,232
No.

604
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:19,872
He seeks eternal life.

605
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,371
Eternal life?

606
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:28,809
The Archmage stands
at the pinnacle of sorcery.

607
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:34,184
Only the secret of eternal life
lies beyond his grasp.

608
01:08:35,127 --> 01:08:37,527
And yet, he covets it.

609
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:42,460
But as he covets, so does he fear
another will discover it first.

610
01:08:42,668 --> 01:08:48,106
That would be unbearable
to one so proud as the Archmage.

611
01:08:48,307 --> 01:08:51,276
What does that have
to do with me?

612
01:08:52,344 --> 01:08:55,871
Because it is you
who have been chosen...

613
01:08:55,981 --> 01:08:58,541
...to gain the secret
of eternal life.

614
01:08:59,585 --> 01:09:04,147
That's why Sparrowhawk
follows you. To kill you.

615
01:09:04,256 --> 01:09:06,315
To bring me death...

616
01:09:06,992 --> 01:09:10,052
Arren, will you come with me?

617
01:09:10,162 --> 01:09:12,221
I've already found it.

618
01:09:12,331 --> 01:09:15,960
I found the door
between life and death.

619
01:09:16,435 --> 01:09:19,700
Together we can open that door.

620
01:09:19,972 --> 01:09:22,406
And together,
we will live forever.

621
01:09:22,508 --> 01:09:26,069
We will conquer every form
of fear and suffering.

622
01:09:26,312 --> 01:09:28,712
Fear and suffering...

623
01:09:30,349 --> 01:09:34,217
Come with me, Arren.
The face of death is terrible!

624
01:09:36,522 --> 01:09:40,720
I don't want to die.

625
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:45,052
Listen to me, Arren.
Tell me your True Name.

626
01:09:45,164 --> 01:09:48,725
Then you will have that
which you most desire.

627
01:09:52,137 --> 01:09:55,766
Come, give me your True Name.

628
01:09:57,643 --> 01:10:01,739
Lebannen...

629
01:10:07,653 --> 01:10:11,817
Now I'm ready for you,
Sparrowhawk.

630
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:23,461
Where are you, Hawk?

631
01:10:58,904 --> 01:11:00,337
Hawk!

632
01:11:04,209 --> 01:11:05,574
What's wrong, Therru?

633
01:11:06,979 --> 01:11:09,379
They came and took
Tenar away!

634
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:12,344
You have to go
to Cob's castle!

635
01:11:12,451 --> 01:11:13,645
Where is Arren?

636
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:18,646
He left! He said it would
come again if he didn't go!

637
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,159
Cob...

638
01:11:21,794 --> 01:11:23,659
Don't worry, Therru.

639
01:11:25,097 --> 01:11:29,158
I'm going to help Tenar.
Wait for my return.

640
01:11:30,002 --> 01:11:34,166
Keep this sword.
Arren will need it.

641
01:11:41,413 --> 01:11:43,847
Stay home, Therru!

642
01:11:58,163 --> 01:11:59,687
Here-we-are!

643
01:12:04,269 --> 01:12:05,236
Come on!

644
01:12:06,305 --> 01:12:07,932
I'm not going anywhere!

645
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:13,302
Lord Cob.

646
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:17,643
We brought the woman.
Just as you ordered.

647
01:12:18,517 --> 01:12:21,577
You've done well, Hare.

648
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:27,051
It was nothing, my lord.
My pleasure is to serve you.

649
01:12:27,393 --> 01:12:28,519
Stand aside!

650
01:12:29,027 --> 01:12:30,392
Why, you!

651
01:12:30,796 --> 01:12:32,195
Are you the boss?

652
01:12:32,631 --> 01:12:36,226
Why did you kidnap me?
Let me go right now!

653
01:12:36,835 --> 01:12:39,804
So sorry for the rough treatment.

654
01:12:40,072 --> 01:12:42,199
I have business with Sparrowhawk.

655
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:47,569
You're a wizard, aren't you!
You should be ashamed!

656
01:12:47,813 --> 01:12:49,974
Go find him yourself!

657
01:12:50,482 --> 01:12:53,246
He's an old friend of mine.

658
01:12:53,419 --> 01:12:56,479
I'd like to invite him here.

659
01:12:57,256 --> 01:13:00,851
And I'm the bait!
You're going to hurt him!

660
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:04,262
Women tax my patience.

661
01:13:04,763 --> 01:13:06,697
Put her in the dungeon.

662
01:13:07,699 --> 01:13:08,961
Do it!

663
01:13:09,902 --> 01:13:11,369
Answer me!

664
01:13:12,271 --> 01:13:15,502
If something happens to
Sparrowhawk, so help me!

665
01:13:17,342 --> 01:13:18,900
- Arren...
- This way!

666
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:33,553
Come, Lebannen.
I have something special for you.

667
01:14:01,487 --> 01:14:02,351
Get in there!

668
01:14:10,929 --> 01:14:15,229
Make yourself at home.
You'll see your wizard soon enough.

669
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:36,382
This place reminds me
of the Tombs.

670
01:14:38,423 --> 01:14:39,890
Sparrowhawk...

671
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:55,264
Cob! Are you making
the same mistake again?

672
01:15:03,315 --> 01:15:04,407
At ease!

673
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:06,478
Any sign of the wizard?

674
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:08,519
Not yet, sir.

675
01:15:09,621 --> 01:15:12,784
Where is that confounded wizard?

676
01:15:15,861 --> 01:15:16,793
Let's see...

677
01:15:20,799 --> 01:15:23,859
There he is!
Take your positions!

678
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:33,441
Here he comes!

679
01:15:39,251 --> 01:15:41,617
Don't let him escape! Now!

680
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,823
Hear me! Open the path!

681
01:15:52,331 --> 01:15:53,423
Stop! Wait!

682
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,597
He tricked us!

683
01:15:56,702 --> 01:15:58,932
Well? Don't just stand there!

684
01:16:05,577 --> 01:16:09,206
Cob! It's Sparrowhawk.
I'm here!

685
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:11,043
Show yourself!

686
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:18,353
It's been a long time,
Sparrowhawk.

687
01:16:19,358 --> 01:16:20,848
I've been waiting.

688
01:16:21,593 --> 01:16:24,528
Cob of Havnor!
I left you at the border...

689
01:16:24,696 --> 01:16:26,459
...of the land of death.

690
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:30,293
I hear you're the Archmage now.

691
01:16:30,569 --> 01:16:32,230
Congratulations.

692
01:16:32,871 --> 01:16:36,671
I'm here, Cob.
Now release Tenar!

693
01:16:38,043 --> 01:16:40,273
You're pitiful, Sparrowhawk.

694
01:16:40,379 --> 01:16:44,713
The great Archmage,
smitten by a woman.

695
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:48,712
You used her to lure me here.
What do you want?

696
01:16:49,388 --> 01:16:51,083
What do you think?

697
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:53,555
I haven't forgotten
how you dragged me...

698
01:16:53,659 --> 01:16:56,321
...to the gates of the Dry Land.

699
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,061
But you've forgotten why!

700
01:16:59,164 --> 01:17:01,928
You used
the Pelnish Lore...

701
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,470
...to toy with the spirits
of the living and the dead.

702
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:07,595
Isn't that enough to repent?

703
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:12,438
You taught me a splendid lesson
there at death's door.

704
01:17:12,778 --> 01:17:15,679
Now I know I can
never accept extinction.

705
01:17:16,481 --> 01:17:20,315
So I gathered every
ancient lore book I could find.

706
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:24,555
Alas, some of their owners
were not cooperative.

707
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:29,057
What evil are you planning, Cob?

708
01:17:29,661 --> 01:17:32,528
I've done it, Sparrowhawk!

709
01:17:32,631 --> 01:17:35,759
I've woven the greatest spell of all.

710
01:17:36,101 --> 01:17:39,366
The door between life and death
has been closed...

711
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:43,066
...since the beginning of time.
But I will open it!

712
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:47,141
That is forbidden!
Don't you understand?

713
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:51,011
Those with power
must wield it with wisdom.

714
01:17:51,149 --> 01:17:54,084
Would you destroy the Balance
that sustains the world?

715
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:56,849
What nonsense!

716
01:17:56,955 --> 01:18:00,015
The Balance is long gone.

717
01:18:00,225 --> 01:18:03,661
You know that
better than anyone.

718
01:18:03,895 --> 01:18:06,090
The Balance was destroyed by Man.

719
01:18:06,565 --> 01:18:12,094
You think you can limit
Man's desire? It's impossible!

720
01:18:12,838 --> 01:18:15,102
I will live forever.

721
01:18:15,207 --> 01:18:18,108
I will gain existence without end!

722
01:18:18,543 --> 01:18:23,845
Cob! Without the cycle
of death and rebirth, there is no life!

723
01:18:24,382 --> 01:18:26,816
I am above Nature!

724
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:37,356
Sparrowhawk! There's someone else
who wants to meet you.

725
01:18:46,505 --> 01:18:48,996
Arren! What are you doing here?

726
01:18:49,107 --> 01:18:53,635
Lebannen! This man would
deprive you of eternal life!

727
01:19:00,786 --> 01:19:03,482
Arren! Did you reveal
your True Name?

728
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:09,126
I'm going to live forever!

729
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:16,127
I'm tired, Sparrowhawk.
Tired of living in fear.

730
01:19:16,601 --> 01:19:19,866
Arren! Life without death is not life!

731
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:24,138
Refuse death, and
you refuse life as well!

732
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,072
Don't lie to me!

733
01:19:46,064 --> 01:19:48,032
Listen to me, Arren.

734
01:19:48,166 --> 01:19:52,364
No man nor any thing
in this world lives forever.

735
01:19:53,538 --> 01:19:57,099
But only to us is it given
to know that we must die.

736
01:19:57,209 --> 01:20:01,612
And that is a precious gift.

737
01:20:02,681 --> 01:20:07,983
This life that is our torment
and our treasure does not endure.

738
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:10,411
It is a wave on the sea.

739
01:20:10,522 --> 01:20:14,652
Would you force the sea
to grow still, to save one wave?

740
01:20:14,826 --> 01:20:16,885
To save yourself?

741
01:20:27,839 --> 01:20:29,033
Arren...

742
01:20:39,517 --> 01:20:41,917
Thought you made
a fool of me?

743
01:20:42,821 --> 01:20:45,585
There's more than
one entrance to this castle!

744
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:49,552
What's happening?
I'm getting weak.

745
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:55,028
Coming here was another
of your blunders, Sparrowhawk.

746
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,930
Your powers are useless
in this place.

747
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:02,206
Hare! Put him in the
dungeon with the woman.

748
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:04,205
I'll finish them tomorrow...

749
01:21:04,709 --> 01:21:07,906
...in the most painful
and humiliating way.

750
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:09,807
Yes, my lord.

751
01:21:10,048 --> 01:21:12,482
On your feet, chickenhawk!

752
01:21:36,007 --> 01:21:36,871
Sparrowhawk!

753
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:41,006
Sparrowhawk! Are you all right?
Sparrowhawk!

754
01:21:41,379 --> 01:21:43,074
It'll all be over tomorrow.

755
01:21:43,181 --> 01:21:46,582
Say your goodbyes
while you still have time!

756
01:21:57,462 --> 01:21:59,657
Sparrowhawk! Sparrowhawk!

757
01:22:00,532 --> 01:22:01,863
Tenar...

758
01:22:01,967 --> 01:22:05,698
How did they do this?
You're the Archmage!

759
01:22:06,604 --> 01:22:10,335
I'm sorry, Tenar.
I keep getting you into trouble.

760
01:22:10,575 --> 01:22:12,873
Stop talking nonsense!

761
01:22:30,095 --> 01:22:31,960
Which way should I go?

762
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:39,696
Arren?

763
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:47,105
Arren! Wait!

764
01:22:48,146 --> 01:22:52,606
Arren! Cob's men came
and took Tenar away!

765
01:23:03,161 --> 01:23:04,287
I have your sword!

766
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:07,559
Sparrowhawk said
to give it to you!

767
01:23:14,839 --> 01:23:16,397
Follow you?

768
01:23:56,614 --> 01:23:59,981
Tenar is a prisoner here.

769
01:24:00,085 --> 01:24:01,382
Sparrowhawk too.

770
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,844
Even Sparrowhawk.

771
01:24:04,255 --> 01:24:08,123
This is yours, isn't it?
Sparrowhawk brought it for you.

772
01:24:09,561 --> 01:24:12,621
We've got to hurry.
They need our help!

773
01:24:14,099 --> 01:24:18,160
I can go no further.
You must go alone.

774
01:24:18,903 --> 01:24:21,929
Bring me that sword.

775
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:24,367
I know you can do it.

776
01:24:25,577 --> 01:24:28,876
What do you mean?
You're right here.

777
01:24:29,614 --> 01:24:31,605
I'm not here.

778
01:24:32,584 --> 01:24:35,382
Cob is holding me
against my will.

779
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,979
Then who are you?

780
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,583
Stay away! Get back!

781
01:24:41,893 --> 01:24:43,155
Don't come closer!

782
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:52,064
Arren's heart was always
full of fear.

783
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:56,170
The fear filled his heart
with darkness.

784
01:24:57,542 --> 01:24:59,169
Fear of what?

785
01:24:59,844 --> 01:25:03,712
The darkness stole his body
and ran away with it.

786
01:25:04,082 --> 01:25:06,915
But it left something
important behind.

787
01:25:12,891 --> 01:25:16,884
Wherever there is darkness,
there also you will find light.

788
01:25:16,995 --> 01:25:19,429
Now the light
that was left behind...

789
01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:22,059
...wanders alone,
like a shadow.

790
01:25:22,834 --> 01:25:23,994
A shadow?

791
01:25:25,336 --> 01:25:30,933
What you see now is just
a shadow chasing its body.

792
01:25:38,483 --> 01:25:39,575
Father...

793
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:44,211
You are Arren, aren't you?

794
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:49,758
Don't worry.
I'll be with you.

795
01:25:51,529 --> 01:25:53,360
I'll give you my True Name.

796
01:25:54,165 --> 01:25:58,864
My True Name
is Lebannen... Lebannen.

797
01:26:00,638 --> 01:26:02,105
Lebannen...

798
01:27:15,747 --> 01:27:16,975
It's him.

799
01:27:20,618 --> 01:27:23,644
He should be ashamed
to call himself Archmage!

800
01:27:23,755 --> 01:27:27,054
Remember who
he was up against.

801
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:29,353
No wizard in Earthsea
is a match for Lord Cob!

802
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,950
Well spoken!

803
01:27:33,097 --> 01:27:36,396
By the way, what's our
little friend up to?

804
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:38,992
He shut himself in his room.

805
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:41,995
Arren's really here!

806
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:45,067
He's a lucky one, that boy.

807
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:49,943
It's just like Lord Cob
to steal the wizard's apprentice.

808
01:27:50,048 --> 01:27:53,017
He's not much
use though, is he?

809
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:54,815
None at all.

810
01:27:54,919 --> 01:27:58,753
When we're through with
the wizard, we'll sell the boy!

811
01:28:08,299 --> 01:28:11,234
All right! Go get
Sparrowhawk and his woman.

812
01:28:11,336 --> 01:28:15,238
The Archmage's time
has finally run out!

813
01:28:17,308 --> 01:28:19,242
They're going to kill them.

814
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:36,421
Arren!

815
01:29:38,089 --> 01:29:39,249
Arren?

816
01:29:41,726 --> 01:29:45,423
What are you doing here?
Did they kidnap you too?

817
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:56,832
Here. This belongs to you.

818
01:29:57,575 --> 01:30:00,510
I'm not worthy to hold
my father's sword.

819
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:04,978
Arren, they've got Tenar
and Sparrowhawk.

820
01:30:05,082 --> 01:30:06,777
They're going to kill them.

821
01:30:06,884 --> 01:30:09,876
Please! Help them
like you helped me!

822
01:30:11,122 --> 01:30:12,589
I can't help anyone.

823
01:30:12,757 --> 01:30:15,851
All I can do is fail.

824
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,928
What's wrong with you?

825
01:30:18,029 --> 01:30:20,793
They'll die
if we don't do something!

826
01:30:25,269 --> 01:30:28,670
They'll die!
We'll lose both of them!

827
01:30:37,949 --> 01:30:41,544
We'll lose the most important
thing in the world.

828
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:46,818
Therru?

829
01:30:50,127 --> 01:30:52,652
What's the most important thing?

830
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,664
Life is the most important thing!

831
01:30:59,737 --> 01:31:04,367
We'll all die someday.
What does it matter?

832
01:31:04,942 --> 01:31:10,039
Why fight for life?
We know it's going to end anyway.

833
01:31:10,348 --> 01:31:14,114
No! Life is precious because
we know we're going to die!

834
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:18,780
You're not afraid of death.
You're afraid of life!

835
01:31:19,223 --> 01:31:22,124
You want to live forever,
then you say nothing matters.

836
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:24,387
It's the same thing!

837
01:31:24,495 --> 01:31:27,521
You're afraid to live
the only life you have!

838
01:31:28,499 --> 01:31:29,796
Therru...

839
01:31:30,101 --> 01:31:32,433
You think your life
belongs to you?

840
01:31:35,673 --> 01:31:39,074
Tenar gave me life.
That's why I have to live...

841
01:31:39,176 --> 01:31:42,202
...to give life to someone else.

842
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:47,383
Lebannen...

843
01:31:48,653 --> 01:31:51,713
That's the only way
we live forever.

844
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:09,633
Therru... how did you know
my True Name?

845
01:32:10,141 --> 01:32:12,109
You told me yourself.

846
01:32:15,112 --> 01:32:19,446
Now I'll tell you mine.
My True Name is...

847
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:22,586
Tehanu... it's Tehanu.

848
01:32:23,487 --> 01:32:25,079
Tehanu...

849
01:32:48,179 --> 01:32:50,079
It'll be dawn soon.

850
01:32:50,615 --> 01:32:53,641
Come on, Therru.
We've got to help them!

851
01:33:03,794 --> 01:33:04,692
Arren, wait!

852
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:06,560
What is it?

853
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:07,631
There!

854
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:15,204
It's Sparrowhawk and Tenar!

855
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,132
Come on!

856
01:33:21,545 --> 01:33:22,637
Jump!

857
01:33:23,247 --> 01:33:25,238
I can't! It's too far!

858
01:33:25,349 --> 01:33:27,214
Don't worry!
You can do it!

859
01:33:34,392 --> 01:33:35,518
Let's go!

860
01:34:03,454 --> 01:34:04,751
Sparrowhawk!

861
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:08,682
Time to say goodbye,
Sparrowhawk.

862
01:34:09,226 --> 01:34:12,491
Your lover is going
on a journey.

863
01:34:12,596 --> 01:34:15,087
Why don't you
send him off yourself?

864
01:34:20,805 --> 01:34:24,138
Don't worry, Sparrowhawk.

865
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:27,242
This world will be
in good hands after you're gone.

866
01:34:28,412 --> 01:34:31,575
What can I do, Sparrowhawk?

867
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:33,246
Tenar.

868
01:34:34,051 --> 01:34:38,249
It's not over yet.
The sun will rise soon.

869
01:34:39,957 --> 01:34:41,481
What do you mean?

870
01:34:42,793 --> 01:34:47,821
Don't you hear it, Tenar?
Help is almost here.

871
01:34:51,435 --> 01:34:54,131
That's enough time
for goodbyes.

872
01:34:54,271 --> 01:34:56,637
Do it! Finish him!

873
01:34:56,741 --> 01:34:57,969
No!

874
01:35:01,579 --> 01:35:03,103
Let them go!

875
01:35:03,914 --> 01:35:04,881
It's you!

876
01:35:04,982 --> 01:35:06,449
Arren! Therru!

877
01:35:06,851 --> 01:35:09,183
Stay out of this, boy!

878
01:35:10,287 --> 01:35:12,653
Don't show him any mercy!

879
01:35:13,257 --> 01:35:14,485
Get back!

880
01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:21,025
Take him!

881
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:34,875
Please don't hurt me!

882
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:37,475
I'm disappointed.

883
01:35:37,882 --> 01:35:40,874
I thought you
and I had an understanding.

884
01:35:41,418 --> 01:35:44,876
Silence!
You don't control me any ore.

885
01:35:45,322 --> 01:35:49,691
Then you shall see
the face of death, Lebannen!

886
01:35:55,933 --> 01:35:57,366
A summoning spell!

887
01:36:02,873 --> 01:36:03,532
Arren!

888
01:36:03,641 --> 01:36:05,074
Stay back!

889
01:36:06,811 --> 01:36:08,335
Now die!

890
01:36:28,532 --> 01:36:31,228
Please! Let me draw it.

891
01:36:32,069 --> 01:36:33,866
For Life!

892
01:37:11,508 --> 01:37:14,944
That sword was
forged with magic!

893
01:37:38,702 --> 01:37:40,363
He's an old man!

894
01:37:40,971 --> 01:37:43,166
Disguised by sorcery.

895
01:37:43,407 --> 01:37:45,432
Lord Cob!

896
01:37:48,445 --> 01:37:50,504
You can't stop me.

897
01:37:50,881 --> 01:37:53,679
I will never accept death.

898
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:57,811
Wizards shouldn't fear death!

899
01:37:58,422 --> 01:38:00,322
You wretched girl!

900
01:38:01,325 --> 01:38:02,952
I'm not like you!

901
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:05,824
I'm better than you.
Insignificant worms!

902
01:38:06,430 --> 01:38:08,830
I studied the wisdom of the ages!

903
01:38:08,933 --> 01:38:12,460
I wield power! I am almighty!

904
01:38:14,772 --> 01:38:18,799
Scorned as a fool by
the wizards of Roke.

905
01:38:18,976 --> 01:38:21,001
Driven out like a dog!

906
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:27,144
But I'll have my revenge.
I will never die.

907
01:38:27,251 --> 01:38:30,516
I'll be the supreme Archmage!

908
01:38:45,803 --> 01:38:46,861
Therru!

909
01:39:19,436 --> 01:39:20,960
Therru!

910
01:39:29,146 --> 01:39:31,614
That little fool!

911
01:39:31,715 --> 01:39:36,414
Hear me, stones.
I unbind you!

912
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:29,063
Sunrise...

913
01:40:32,076 --> 01:40:33,270
Let me go!

914
01:40:37,714 --> 01:40:39,011
Does it hurt, girl?

915
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:40,242
Cob!

916
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:43,446
Let her go!

917
01:40:43,921 --> 01:40:45,650
Stay back!

918
01:40:45,756 --> 01:40:49,089
Death is terrifying!

919
01:40:49,993 --> 01:40:51,017
Don't do it!

920
01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:57,691
So terrifying.

921
01:41:02,406 --> 01:41:03,270
Wait!

922
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:30,660
So terrifying... very terrifying...

923
01:41:31,135 --> 01:41:34,332
Cob! You're just like me.

924
01:41:34,671 --> 01:41:38,232
You turn away from light
and see only darkness!

925
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:42,144
No! Keep away!

926
01:41:44,481 --> 01:41:47,245
You forgot that all life
is connected.

927
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:50,343
Life can't be hoarded,
it can only be given!

928
01:41:51,021 --> 01:41:54,184
Deny death,
and you deny life!

929
01:41:54,691 --> 01:41:57,251
No! You're wrong!

930
01:41:58,562 --> 01:42:02,362
Face the truth, Cob!
Everyone fears death!

931
01:42:03,867 --> 01:42:08,236
No! I don't want to die.

932
01:42:09,473 --> 01:42:10,371
Cob!

933
01:42:11,575 --> 01:42:12,701
No!

934
01:42:13,744 --> 01:42:15,006
Therru!

935
01:42:26,056 --> 01:42:28,286
Therru... Arren...

936
01:42:37,768 --> 01:42:38,996
Arren!

937
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:51,804
Time to die! Time to die!

938
01:42:51,915 --> 01:42:53,143
Arren!

939
01:42:53,951 --> 01:42:56,511
And you will join him.

940
01:43:02,659 --> 01:43:05,321
Let her go! Don't kill her!

941
01:43:08,131 --> 01:43:12,124
All who oppose me must die!

942
01:43:41,898 --> 01:43:45,698
She's dead, she's dead.
Poor thing.

943
01:43:56,546 --> 01:43:58,673
Sun is rising.

944
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:05,679
Hurry... must hurry...

945
01:44:05,789 --> 01:44:07,279
Stop!

946
01:44:44,594 --> 01:44:45,891
Therru!

947
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:57,370
Eternal life!

948
01:45:02,846 --> 01:45:04,871
Shadow, return to darkness!

949
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:08,782
Give me life!

950
01:45:15,025 --> 01:45:17,789
I want life... life!

951
01:45:24,835 --> 01:45:26,302
Life!

952
01:45:31,641 --> 01:45:34,804
I want to live!

953
01:46:05,108 --> 01:46:08,043
Tehanu!

954
01:46:51,288 --> 01:46:53,381
So you're safe too.

955
01:46:58,562 --> 01:46:59,995
What about them?

956
01:47:00,964 --> 01:47:04,991
They'll be fine.
They have wings.

957
01:48:28,451 --> 01:48:30,851
Thank you... Therru.

958
01:48:37,327 --> 01:48:40,319
I'm going back
to pay for my crime.

959
01:48:41,298 --> 01:48:43,732
And to face myself.

960
01:48:45,902 --> 01:48:47,028
Arren.

961
01:48:49,005 --> 01:48:52,702
Can I come to see you
again someday?

962
01:48:58,481 --> 01:48:59,470
Come on.

963
01:48:59,783 --> 01:49:03,275
We have to thank
Sparrowhawk and Tenar.

964
01:49:18,668 --> 01:49:26,040
<i>The lone hawk in the sky</i>

965
01:49:26,276 --> 01:49:34,115
<i>Struggles against the wind</i>

966
01:49:34,351 --> 01:49:46,627
<i>Here there is only light and darkness
He has the sky to himself</i>

967
01:49:52,936 --> 01:50:00,240
<i>You who looked up to the sky and wept</i>

968
01:50:00,477 --> 01:50:08,111
<i>You who live alone</i>

969
01:50:08,551 --> 01:50:15,616
<i>Let me hear your True Name</i>

970
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:26,235
<i>For one day you'll be gone</i>

971
01:50:28,138 --> 01:50:35,169
<i>As light dissolves into darkness</i>

972
01:50:35,779 --> 01:50:43,413
<i>Your song passes straight
through my heart</i>

973
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:53,591
<i>Let me sing it for you</i>

974
01:51:03,039 --> 01:51:07,408
The End

975
01:51:13,249 --> 01:51:17,242
Voices
