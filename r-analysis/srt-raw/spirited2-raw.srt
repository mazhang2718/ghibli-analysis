1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,759
Tokuma Shoten, Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network,
Dentsu, Walt Disney Japan, Tohokushinsha Film
and Mitsubishi present

2
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,889
Good luck, Chihiro
Hope we meet again

3
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,892
Chihiro? Chihiro!

4
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,561
We're almost there.

5
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,482
This really is the middle of nowhere.

6
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:28,402
I'll have to shop in the next town.

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,612
We'll just have to make do.

8
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,034
Look, there's the elementary school.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,952
That's your new school, Chihiro.

10
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,080
Why, it looks very nice.

11
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,923
I liked my old school.

12
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,972
Mom, my flowers got bent.

13
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,683
No wonder,
the way you squeeze them.

14
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,770
A little water
and they'll perk right up.

15
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,399
My first bouquet,
and it's farewell flowers.

16
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,986
What about the rose
you got for your birthday?

17
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:14,114
One rose?
One rose isn't a bouquet.

18
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,908
You dropped the card.

19
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:20,412
Now pull yourself together.
This is a busy day for us.

20
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:44,812
SPIRITED AWAY

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,161
Wait a minute.
Did I take a wrong turn?

22
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,080
I don't get it.

23
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,332
That must be it up there.

24
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,210
The blue one on the end.

25
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,962
That's it.

26
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,048
I guess I turned off too soon.

27
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,175
Maybe if we go straight?

28
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,845
Oh, please.
That's how we always get lost.

29
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,972
Let's just see what's up here.

30
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,017
- What are those things?
- Houses for the guardian spirits.

31
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,484
Dad, are you sure?

32
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,195
Don't worry, we've got 4-wheel drive.

33
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,156
Sit down, Chihiro.

34
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,636
What are you doing? Slow down!

35
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,472
There's a tunnel.

36
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,655
What's this building?

37
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,616
It looks like a gate.

38
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,578
Honey, I think we should go back.

39
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,622
Chihiro!

40
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,124
Honestly...

41
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,877
Look at this, it's just plaster.

42
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,087
This thing's pretty new.

43
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,599
The air's blowing in.

44
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,184
What is it?

45
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,603
Let's see what's on the other side.

46
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,356
It's creepy, Dad.
Can't we go back?

47
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:56,777
Don't be such a chicken.
C'mon, let's take a look.

48
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,112
The movers will be there soon.

49
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,283
So? They've got the keys.
They'll handle everything.

50
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,451
I know, but...

51
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,536
No! I won't go.

52
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,582
Dad, let's go.

53
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,167
Come on, it'll be fun.

54
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,002
I'm staying here!

55
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,763
Chihiro, you wait in the car.

56
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,600
Mom...

57
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,895
Wait up!

58
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,069
Watch your step.

59
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,531
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.

60
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,858
- What is this?
- Wait, hear that?

61
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,536
- A train.
- Maybe we're near a station.

62
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,538
Let's find out.
It must be close.

63
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,494
Houses, way out here?

64
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,245
I knew it.

65
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,415
It's an abandoned theme park.

66
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,587
They built lots of them
back in the nineties.

67
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,256
But they went bust
when the economy tanked.

68
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,926
This must be one of them.

69
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,011
Wait, where are we going?

70
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,764
Let's go back, Dad.

71
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,394
Please!

72
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,906
Mom, that building's moaning.

73
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,241
It's just the wind.

74
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:54,246
What a lovely spot.
We should've brought the sandwiches.

75
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,126
This would've been a river.

76
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,258
Do you smell something?

77
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,178
- Something smells good.
- You're right.

78
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,098
Maybe they're open
for business after all.

79
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,975
Hurry up, Chihiro.

80
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,185
Wait for me!

81
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,636
This way.

82
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,186
Can you believe it?
Nothing but restaurants.

83
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,521
There's nobody here.

84
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,484
Over there.

85
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,823
Come on!

86
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,544
Come take a look.

87
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,299
This is amazing.

88
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,344
Hello, is anybody here?

89
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,888
Come on, Chihiro.
It looks delicious.

90
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,348
You got customers!

91
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,814
Don't worry.
We'll pay when they show up.

92
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,484
You're right.
Let's see now...

93
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,736
What kind of bird is this?

94
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,366
It's delicious! Chihiro, try some.

95
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,867
I don't want any.

96
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,995
Can't we go?
They'll be mad at us.

97
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,415
Don't worry, your father's here.

98
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,709
I've got credit cards and cash.

99
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,383
Have some, Chihiro.
It's very tender.

100
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,095
- Mustard.
- Thanks.

101
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,483
Mom! Dad!

102
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,387
What a weird building.

103
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,919
A train!

104
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,390
You can't be here.
Go now!

105
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,394
It's almost sundown.
Go before it gets dark!

106
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,190
They're lighting the lamps.
Come on!

107
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,901
I'll hold them off.
Get across the river!

108
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,251
What's his problem?

109
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,969
Dad?

110
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,596
Dad, let's go home.

111
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,473
Let's go, Dad!

112
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,752
Dad!

113
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,295
Mom!

114
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,765
Mommy!

115
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,829
Water!

116
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,511
No...

117
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,387
It's just a dream.

118
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,267
Wake up, wake up.
Wake up!

119
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,270
Please wake up.

120
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,028
It's just a dream, a stupid dream.

121
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,114
Go away, disappear.

122
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,908
Disappear.

123
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,417
I'm fading away!

124
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,673
This has to be a dream.

125
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,769
Don't be afraid.
I'm a friend.

126
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,938
No, no, no!

127
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,065
Open your mouth. Eat this.

128
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,027
Unless you eat something
from this world, you'll disappear.

129
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,445
No!

130
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,619
Don't worry.
You won't turn into a pig.

131
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,621
Chew it and swallow.

132
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,633
Good, now you'll be fine.

133
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,468
See for yourself.

134
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,936
I can touch you.

135
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,355
Of course.
Now come.

136
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,484
Where's Mom and Dad?
Did they really turn into pigs?

137
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,236
You can't see them now,
but you will.

138
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,532
Quiet!

139
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,887
It's looking for you.
There's no time, let's run.

140
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,683
I can't stand up.
What should I do?

141
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,728
- My legs don't work.
- Relax and take a deep breath.

142
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,611
In the name of the wind and
water within, unbind her.

143
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:29,862
Stand up!

144
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,116
Don't breathe while we're on the bridge.

145
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,497
One tiny breath will break my spell.
We don't want anyone to see you.

146
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,212
I'm scared.

147
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,881
Be calm.

148
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,051
Welcome, your presence honors us.

149
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,386
Greetings, welcome.

150
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,890
- I've finished my rounds.
- Welcome back, sir.

151
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,851
Take a deep breath.

152
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,103
Hold it.

153
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,791
Welcome back.
We've been waiting for you.

154
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,877
Just a little further.

155
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,379
Master Haku!

156
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,757
Where have you...

157
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,968
A human?

158
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,096
Run!

159
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,948
Master Haku, Master Haku!

160
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,700
I smell something.
A human intruder!

161
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,078
I smell humans!
The stench of humans!

162
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,872
- They know you're here.
- Sorry, I messed up.

163
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,166
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

164
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,919
Now listen.
I'll tell you what to do.

165
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,671
If you stay here, they'll find you.

166
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,633
I'll distract them while you get away.

167
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,177
No, don't go!
Stay with me, please.

168
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,848
You have no choice,
if you want to survive here...

169
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,683
and save your parents, too.

170
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,353
So I wasn't dreaming.
They did turn into pigs.

171
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,938
Listen carefully.

172
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,317
After I'm gone,
go through the back gate.

173
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,320
Take the stairs
all the way down.

174
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,573
You'll find
the boiler room where...

175
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,199
they stoke the fires.

176
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,661
Look for Kamaji.

177
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,163
Kamaji?

178
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,624
Ask him for work.

179
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,418
If he refuses, keep asking.

180
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,422
If you don't work,
Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

181
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,048
Yubaba?

182
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,926
She's the sorceress who rules our world.

183
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,471
She'll try to trick you into leaving...

184
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,182
but keep asking for work.

185
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:49,145
The work's hard, but it will protect you.
Then even Yubaba can't harm you.

186
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,191
Master Haku, Master Haku!

187
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,609
I have to go.

188
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,946
- Remember I'm your friend, Chihiro.
- How did you know my name?

189
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,449
You told me long ago.

190
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,701
My name is Haku.

191
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,414
Here I am!

192
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,627
Master Haku, Yubaba's waiting.

193
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,755
I know, I've been searching too.

194
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,796
Um...

195
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,007
Excuse me.

196
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,182
Um...

197
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,232
Are you Kamaji?

198
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,702
Haku sent me.
Please let me work here.

199
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:04,543
What, all at once?

200
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,463
Get to work, you little runts!

201
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,928
I am Kamaji, slave to the boilers
that heat the baths.

202
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,222
Step on it, boys!

203
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,475
Please let me work here.

204
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:23,854
I've got all the help I need.
There's soot everywhere.

205
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,899
I'll never run out of help.

206
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,332
Oh, I'm sorry.

207
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,088
Wait a second.

208
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,434
Out of the way.

209
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,740
Wait, what do I do with this?

210
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,123
Do I leave it here?

211
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,626
Finish what you start.

212
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,064
Get to work, runts!
Wanna turn back into soot?

213
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,901
And you, better watch it.
You can't just take someone's work.

214
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,571
If they don't work,
their spell will be broken.

215
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,825
There's no work for you here.
Try somewhere else.

216
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,336
You sootballs got a problem?

217
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,963
Get to work!

218
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,632
Chow time!

219
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,343
What, you guys at it again?

220
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,181
Give it a rest.
Where's your bowl?

221
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,143
I keep telling you to leave it out.

222
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,937
Food's here.
Break time!

223
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,663
The human! You're gonna catch it.

224
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,999
They're having a fit about it upstairs.

225
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,002
She's my granddaughter.

226
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,587
Your granddaughter!

227
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:21,175
She says she wants work,
but I don't need any help.

228
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,803
Could you take her
to Yubaba for me?

229
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,764
This girl can handle herself.

230
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,308
Not a chance.
Yubaba would kill me.

231
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:34,229
Not even for this?
Charcoal-roasted newt, finest quality.

232
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:40,319
If you want work, you have to
sign a contract with Yubaba.

233
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,654
Might as well try your luck.

234
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,658
Fine!
You there, follow me.

235
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,501
What about
"Yes, ma'am" or "Thank you"?

236
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,002
Yes, ma'am.

237
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,504
What a klutz.
Move it!

238
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,588
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,260
Leave the shoes.
And the socks!

240
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,553
Yes'm.

241
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,979
Aren't you going to thank Kamaji?
He's looking out for you.

242
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,150
Thank you very much.

243
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,986
Good luck.

244
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,541
Yubaba lives on
the top floor in the back.

245
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,391
Move it, will you?

246
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,272
You'll lose your nose.

247
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,799
- One more elevator after this.
- Yes'm.

248
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,430
We're here.

249
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,143
Welcome, sir!

250
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:46,528
This elevator stops here.
Please use another one.

251
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,678
- He's following us.
- Quit gawking.

252
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,363
Here we are.

253
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,620
Your room is on the right.

254
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,625
- Lin?
- Yes sir!

255
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,962
Something smells.

256
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,798
It's human.
You reek of human.

257
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,257
Is that so?

258
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,719
I smell it, I do.
Smells mighty tasty, too.

259
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,722
You're hiding something.

260
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,183
Tell me the truth.

261
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,601
Maybe it's this.

262
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,354
Roasted newt? Give it here!

263
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,732
Not a chance.
The girls asked me to get it.

264
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,986
I'm begging you.
I'll settle for a leg.

265
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,990
Pull the lever to go up, sir.

266
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,347
Can't you even knock?

267
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,101
What a plain little girl.

268
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,363
Now, come.

269
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,743
I said, come!

270
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,468
Ow...

271
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,690
What a racket.
Could you be quiet?

272
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,835
Please...

273
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,337
Let me work here.

274
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,891
Stop your babbling.

275
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,311
Why do I need
a weakling like you?

276
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:33,815
Besides, this is no place for humans.

277
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,319
Millions of spirits come here...

278
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:41,281
to purge themselves of toil and care.

279
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,410
Your parents, my goodness!
They certainly had some nerve.

280
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:49,122
Gobbling our guests' food
like a couple of pigs.

281
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,374
Just deserts, I'd say.

282
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:57,214
And as for you, you'll never
see your world again either.

283
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,762
You'd make a lovely piglet.

284
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,973
Or perhaps a lump of coal?

285
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,358
Trembling, aren't you?

286
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,111
Still, I'm impressed
you made it this far.

287
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,490
Someone must've helped you.

288
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,867
I must thank your friend.

289
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:30,622
Just who was it, my dear?
You can tell me.

290
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,168
Please let me work here!

291
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,836
Not that again!

292
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,380
I want to work here!

293
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:43,635
Shut your mouth!

294
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:51,059
Why on earth should I hire you?

295
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:55,480
Anyone can see you're
a lazy, spoiled, stupid crybaby.

296
00:37:55,648 --> 00:38:00,652
What job would I possibly have
for someone like you?

297
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:06,658
You're wasting your time.
I've got all the bums I need.

298
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:11,830
Or maybe I'll give you
the nastiest job I've got...

299
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,999
and work you night and day...

300
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:19,045
until you breathe your very last breath!

301
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,853
Now, now.
What's wrong, my dear?

302
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,356
I'm coming.
That's a good baby.

303
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,359
Are you still here?
Get out, right now.

304
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,403
I want to work here!

305
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:47,115
Keep your voice down.

306
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,910
I'll be right there, just be patient.

307
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,414
That's a good baby.
There, there.

308
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,791
Please give me a job!

309
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,711
All right, just pipe down.

310
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:04,591
There, there, good baby.

311
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,446
That's your contract.

312
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,449
Sign on the bottom line.

313
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,576
I'll put you to work.

314
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:35,163
But one peep out of you
about anything...

315
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,749
and I'll turn you into a piglet.

316
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,502
Should I sign here?

317
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:44,130
Where else?
Quit dilly-dallying.

318
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,929
Unbelievable.

319
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,265
What a ridiculous oath I took.

320
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:59,270
I'm bound to give work
to whoever asks.

321
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,400
- Finished?
- Yes.

322
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,490
- Chihiro, that's your name?
- Yes.

323
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,451
Quite a fancy name.

324
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,672
From now on, your name is Sen.

325
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,966
Understand? Sen.

326
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,677
Answer me, Sen!

327
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,262
I understand.

328
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,638
Yes ma'am?

329
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:41,062
- See to her, she's starting work today.
- Very well.

330
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:42,939
What is your name?

331
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,693
Chi... I mean, Sen.

332
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,154
Then follow me, Sen.

333
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:58,997
Haku, I...

334
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,999
No idle chatter.

335
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,460
Call me Master Haku.

336
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,353
I'm afraid even Yubaba
can't give an order like that.

337
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,147
Humans aren't allowed here.

338
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,191
She signed the contract.

339
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,526
- What!
- I'll work hard.

340
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,280
- Don't send her to us.
- She stinks to high heaven.

341
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,867
She won't stink
after three days of our food.

342
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:40,205
If she doesn't measure up,
do with her as you will.

343
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,292
Now go back to work.
Where's Lin?

344
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,794
What, you're dumping her on me?

345
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,546
You wanted an assistant.

346
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,633
That's right! Lin's just perfect.

347
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,134
Go, Sen.

348
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,260
Yes sir.

349
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,389
What a pain.
You're gonna pay for this.

350
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,517
Off you go.

351
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,187
Come on.

352
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,531
You pulled it off!

353
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,283
You're so thick, I was worried.

354
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,371
Keep your wits about you.
If you need anything, ask me.

355
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,791
What's wrong?

356
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,794
My legs are shaking.

357
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,384
This is where we live.

358
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,762
Eat, sleep and you'll be fine.

359
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,642
Your apron.
Keep it clean.

360
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,018
Trousers.

361
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,896
You're so puny.

362
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,065
Too big.

363
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,694
Lin, are there...

364
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,778
What?

365
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,030
Are there two Hakus here?

366
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:59,701
Two of that one?
I sure hope not.

367
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,286
Still too big.

368
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,163
He's Yubaba's apprentice.
Be careful around him.

369
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,752
Now where was that...

370
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,630
All right, here we go.

371
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:18,094
Hey, are you okay?
Don't fall apart on me.

372
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,306
What's all the noise, Lin?

373
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,850
New girl.
Says she feels faint.

374
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:00,113
Meet me at the bridge.
I'll take you to your mother and father.

375
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,491
My shoes are gone.

376
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,424
Thank you.

377
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,327
Follow me.

378
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,956
Dad, Mom, it's me!

379
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,791
It's Sen.

380
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,878
Mom! Dad!

381
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,924
Are they sick? Are they hurt?

382
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,802
They're just sleeping.
Their stomachs are full.

383
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,472
They don't remember
they were ever human.

384
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:21,522
Listen to me!
I promise I'll save you.

385
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,817
Don't get too fat
or they'll eat you.

386
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,702
Hide these.

387
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,956
I thought they were gone.

388
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,292
For when you go home.

389
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,759
This was a farewell card.

390
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,678
Chihiro?

391
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,182
Chihiro...
That's my name!

392
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,685
Yubaba controls us
by stealing our names.

393
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:04,523
You're Sen here.
Keep your real name a secret.

394
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,944
She almost got my name.
I was turning into Sen.

395
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,031
Without your real name,
you'll never find your way home.

396
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,451
I no longer remember mine.

397
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,453
Your real name?

398
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,998
But it's strange,
I remember yours.

399
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,045
Better eat, you must be hungry.

400
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,713
I don't want to.

401
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:32,093
I put a spell on them
to give you back your strength.

402
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,173
You've had a rough time.
Better eat more.

403
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,356
You know the way back.

404
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,151
Thanks Haku.
I promise to work hard.

405
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,581
Where were you? I was worried.

406
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:08,916
Sorry.

407
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,052
Out of the way.

408
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,151
Come on,
give it some elbow grease.

409
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,237
Starting today, you two
are on the big tub.

410
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,531
What? That's Frog work!

411
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,742
Orders from the top.
And no shirking, either.

412
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,764
Aren't you getting wet?

413
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,478
Sen, come on!

414
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,897
Coming!

415
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,773
I'll leave this open.

416
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,678
- On the big tub, Lin?
- Stuff it.

417
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,477
Just look at this.
Hasn't been scrubbed in ages.

418
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,161
The big tub is reserved
for our filthiest guests.

419
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,996
It's caked with sludge.

420
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,749
Lin! Sen!
First customers are coming.

421
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,542
All right already!

422
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,878
Man, this is pure harassment.

423
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:21,131
Go get a tag
from the foreman.

424
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,341
A tag?

425
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,012
For an herbal bath.

426
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,514
Right.

427
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,267
Lin, what's a foreman?

428
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,315
Something's coming.
I wonder...

429
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:51,161
Is some good-for-nothing
using the rain to sneak in?

430
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,938
Absolutely not,
it's too valuable to waste.

431
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,857
Good morning!

432
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,276
Feeling refreshed?

433
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,861
For Kasuga.

434
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,155
One deluxe sulfur bath.

435
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,991
No point standing there.
Back to work.

436
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,868
Scrub it with your hands.

437
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,745
Good morning!

438
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:33,996
Your bare hands.

439
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,374
But she said
it has to be an herbal bath.

440
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,126
You just don't get it.

441
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,211
Mugwort, right?

442
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,505
Relax and enjoy.

443
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:55,225
Foreman.
Yes ma'am!

444
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,354
Thank you!

445
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,605
But that's not...

446
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,231
Hey you, wait!

447
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:02,232
What's the trouble?

448
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,817
Oh, nothing at all.

449
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,736
We have an intruder.

450
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:06,695
A human?

451
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,823
You figure it out.
Haku's gone today.

452
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,409
Wow, you got a really good one.

453
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:15,079
This goes straight to Kamaji.

454
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,499
Water should be right up.

455
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,466
Yank this for hot water.
Go ahead, try it.

456
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,477
You're really are a klutz.

457
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,729
Look at that color.

458
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:43,148
This one has dried worm salts.

459
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,652
With water this murky,
who's gonna see the sludge?

460
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,615
Yank it again
when it's full. It'll stop.

461
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,411
You can let go now.
I'll go get our breakfast.

462
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,787
Okay.

463
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,228
Ouch!

464
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,943
Um...
The bath's not ready yet.

465
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,950
So many...

466
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,580
They're for me?

467
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,210
But I don't need them.

468
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,715
No, you gave me one already.

469
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,606
Madam!

470
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:09,276
- It's a Stink Spirit.
- Yes, and a large one, too.

471
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,153
It's headed straight for the bridge!

472
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,655
Please turn back.

473
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:17,659
Please go!
The baths are closed for the night.

474
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,370
Please withdraw, please!

475
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:23,165
Stinky!

476
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:27,252
That's odd.
Stink Spirits feel different.

477
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,922
Well, now that it's here,
better go greet it!

478
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:34,176
All we can do
is get rid of it fast.

479
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,553
Everyone, please return to your rooms!

480
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,430
Please hurry.
Terribly sorry!

481
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,518
Lin and Sen, Yubaba wants you.

482
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,435
Yes sir!

483
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,271
Pay attention, this is your debut.

484
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:49,191
Show the customer to the big tub.

485
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,194
Remember, one peep
out of you and you're coal.

486
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:55,364
- Got it?
- It has arrived.

487
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,751
No, that's not polite!

488
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:19,263
Welgum to our bazz.

489
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,601
Oh...
Money...!

490
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:27,312
Hurry Sen, take it!

491
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:28,689
Yez ma'am.

492
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:41,577
Wud are you wading for?
Show him to da bazz!

493
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,453
Diz way...

494
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,640
Sen!

495
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,439
Horrible!

496
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,482
Breakfast!

497
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,693
Open the windows, all of 'em!

498
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,572
What? Just a minute.

499
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,955
- That's really filthy.
- It's not funny.

500
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,666
What will she do?

501
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:17,631
Ah, she's going to refill the tub.

502
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:21,718
Oh dear, she's soiling the walls
with her dirty hands!

503
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:35,732
Did you give Sen new tags?

504
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,527
Never, what a waste!

505
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,446
All that precious herbal essence!

506
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,766
Sen! Sen, where are you?

507
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,143
- Lin!
- Are you okay?

508
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,937
I asked Kamaji to help us out.

509
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,565
He's sending his
best herbal essence.

510
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:02,194
Thanks. There's a thorn
or something stuck in him.

511
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,320
A thorn?

512
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,071
I can't pull it out.

513
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,908
A thorn? Hmm...

514
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,036
Get everyone downstairs!

515
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:11,953
Hurry!

516
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,000
Sen and Lin!

517
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,586
Our guest is no Stink Spirit.

518
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,256
Use this rope.

519
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,466
Yes ma'am!

520
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,726
Tie it good and tight!

521
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:39,940
Hurry up!
Girls, lend a hand!

522
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,942
It's tied!

523
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,530
Everyone ready? All together now!

524
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,449
Heave!

525
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,952
And heave!

526
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:56,706
Heave!

527
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:05,465
A bicycle?

528
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:09,469
I knew it.
Now, heave!

529
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,222
Heave!

530
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:46,423
Sen, are you all right?

531
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,394
Well done.

532
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,967
Gold! It's gold!

533
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,720
Hands off! That's company property.

534
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:37,307
Quiet! Our guest is still with us.

535
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:46,149
Sen, you're in the way.
Get down from there.

536
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,818
Open the main gates!
He's leaving!

537
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:19,683
Sen, you're a wonder!
You made us a fortune.

538
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,978
That was the guardian
of a great river.

539
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,771
Everyone, learn from Sen!

540
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,357
Sake on the house tonight.

541
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:30,527
Now hand over all
that gold you picked up.

542
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,167
Want some? I swiped them.

543
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,044
Thanks.

544
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:50,380
What a day.

545
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:54,300
Haku missed the whole thing.

546
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,302
Not Haku again!

547
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,597
Sometimes he just disappears.

548
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:03,810
They say Yubaba makes
him do bad stuff.

549
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:04,728
Really?

550
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,271
Lights out, Lin.

551
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,439
Okay.

552
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:35,300
There's a town.
And the water's like an ocean.

553
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,470
What did you expect
after all that rain?

554
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:44,309
I'm gonna get there someday.
I'll get out of here for sure.

555
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,126
What's wrong?

556
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:41,199
Gold!

557
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:47,038
Who are you? You're no customer.

558
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:48,915
You're not allowed in there.

559
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:58,716
Hey, it's gold! For me?

560
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:06,349
You can make gold?

561
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:12,856
Gimme!

562
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:22,782
Who's down here?

563
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,202
It's way past lights out.

564
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:33,042
Hey boss, I'm hungry.

565
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,210
Starved, in fact.

566
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:35,253
That voice...

567
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:37,297
There, I'll pay you now.

568
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:40,675
I'm a customer.
I want a bath.

569
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:42,427
Wake everyone up!

570
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:51,227
Mom and Dad, the river guardian
gave me this medicine.

571
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:54,272
If you take it,
you'll be people again.

572
01:09:58,402 --> 01:10:00,403
Dad, Mom, where are you?

573
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:02,030
Daddy!

574
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,292
What an awful dream.

575
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,086
Lin?

576
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:22,800
Where is everybody?

577
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:32,101
Wow, it really did
turn into an ocean!

578
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:40,360
I can see where Mom and
Dad are from here.

579
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,032
Kamaji lit the fires already.

580
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,076
Did I sleep that long?

581
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:54,749
The customer's waiting.
Can't you work faster?

582
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:58,878
Serve everything you've got,
even leftovers!

583
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:01,756
Sen!

584
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:02,882
Lin?

585
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,843
I was just coming
to wake you up, look!

586
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,346
Gold! He gave me real gold.

587
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,723
We've got a real high roller.

588
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:13,226
Please, sir, try this!

589
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,983
Throw us some gold!

590
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:25,321
I'm starving, bring it all!

591
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,244
Who's this guest?

592
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,914
Come on, Yubaba's still asleep.
Now's your chance.

593
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,250
I'm going to see Kamaji.

594
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:40,003
I wouldn't go there now.

595
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,338
He's angry because they woke him up.

596
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:44,340
Lin, let's go back for more.

597
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:12,869
What if I can't recognize my parents?

598
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:16,456
I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

599
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:46,235
That's the dragon I saw.

600
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:48,237
It's coming this way.

601
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:52,283
Those aren't birds!

602
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:06,798
Haku, don't give up.
Over here!

603
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,467
Haku!

604
01:13:28,862 --> 01:13:30,029
It's just paper.

605
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:00,476
Haku? It is you, isn't it?

606
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:09,944
Are you hurt?
Those paper birds are gone.

607
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,362
You're safe now.

608
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,294
He's going to Yubaba.

609
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:29,338
What should I do? He'll die!

610
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:41,559
Now the richest man
in the whole wide world...

611
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:45,938
has come to grace us
with his presence.

612
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,900
Greetings!

613
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:52,361
Now let us appeal
to his generosity.

614
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,697
Please, sir! Over here.

615
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,327
I hope I get some.

616
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,454
They say gold
springs from his palms.

617
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:05,374
Toss some this way, sir!

618
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:10,755
What are you doing?

619
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:11,839
Going upstairs.

620
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:14,008
No you don't.
What's this?

621
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:15,968
Blood!

622
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,141
Out of the way,
we have a guest.

623
01:15:23,727 --> 01:15:25,520
Thank you for your help.

624
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,314
Get out of the way!

625
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:51,921
I don't need it.

626
01:15:54,841 --> 01:15:57,176
I'm busy, please excuse me.

627
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:11,691
Quiet! Quiet down.

628
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,026
Back, get back!

629
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:16,571
Please excuse her manners.

630
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:20,241
The girl is new and a human.

631
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:25,371
What's so funny?
Wipe off that smile.

632
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:26,956
Why, I would never...

633
01:16:31,878 --> 01:16:34,255
He ate them!

634
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,426
Yubaba!

635
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:17,918
We're in a fine mess now.

636
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:20,629
He's a No Face.

637
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:22,757
That's right, a No Face!

638
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:25,968
Your greed attracted quite a guest.

639
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:29,722
Don't do anything stupid
until I get down there.

640
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,683
Just look at this carpet.

641
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:35,060
Get Haku out of here.

642
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:37,062
He's useless to me now.

643
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:02,630
Bo, sleeping outside
your crib again?

644
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:10,679
Oh I'm sorry, you were
sleeping like such a good baby.

645
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:13,766
Baba still has work to do.

646
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:19,480
Go back to sleep now,
that's a good baby.

647
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,426
Ouch, let me go!

648
01:20:49,886 --> 01:20:51,720
Oh, thanks for helping me.

649
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:55,140
But I'm in a hurry,
please let me go.

650
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,601
You came to make me sick.

651
01:20:58,144 --> 01:21:00,729
The outside has bad germs.

652
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:05,484
I'm a human.
Maybe you never saw one before.

653
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:08,028
You'll get sick out there.

654
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:10,239
Stay here and play with me.

655
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:11,949
Are you sick?

656
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:14,910
I'm in here 'cause
I'll get sick outside.

657
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:17,496
Staying inside will make you sick!

658
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:21,375
You see, someone I really
care about is badly hurt.

659
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:23,127
I've got to go right now.

660
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,628
Please let me go.

661
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:29,967
If you go, I'll start crying.
Then Baba will come and kill you.

662
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,844
I'll break your little arm.

663
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,095
You're hurting me!

664
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:35,764
Please, I'll come play with you later.

665
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:37,516
No, I wanna play now!

666
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:43,689
Blood! See? It's blood!

667
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:56,785
Haku!

668
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,204
Go away!

669
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:00,414
It's you, isn't it?

670
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:01,957
Hang on!

671
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:03,375
Be quiet!

672
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:04,627
Haku!

673
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:11,383
Go away!

674
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:15,387
No!

675
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:34,239
I'm not afraid of blood.
I'll cry if you don't play.

676
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:36,241
Please be a good boy and wait.

677
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:39,662
If you don't play
with me I'll cry...

678
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,040
Please, wait!

679
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:46,460
What a racket.
Simmer down.

680
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:50,172
You're a little butterball, aren't you?

681
01:22:58,014 --> 01:23:00,224
I am a bit transparent here.

682
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,183
Baba...

683
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:05,771
Oh dear, can't you even tell
me from your own mother?

684
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:16,865
There, that gives you
a little more freedom.

685
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:20,285
Let's see now.
What shall we turn you into?

686
01:23:38,304 --> 01:23:41,015
This is our little secret.
If you tell anyone...

687
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:43,183
I'll do the same to you.

688
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:45,894
Who are you?

689
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:48,439
Yubaba's older twin sister.

690
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:52,359
Thanks to you I've had
a nice tour of the place.

691
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:54,445
Now hand over the dragon.

692
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:57,072
What are you going to do?
He needs help.

693
01:23:57,407 --> 01:24:00,534
That dragon's a thief.
He works for my sister.

694
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:03,704
He stole a valuable seal from my house.

695
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:06,582
Haku would never do that.
He's too kind.

696
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:10,627
All dragons are kind.
Kind and stupid...

697
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:15,340
and eager to learn
my sister's magical ways.

698
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:19,344
This boy will do anything
that greedy woman wants.

699
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,680
Now step aside.

700
01:24:21,806 --> 01:24:24,266
It's too late for him anyway.

701
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:27,561
The thing he stole
had a protection spell.

702
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:29,813
Now the thief will die.

703
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:32,274
No, don't!

704
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,784
What are you up to now?

705
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,578
All right, that's enough.
Back to your room.

706
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:54,296
Oh dear, that was careless...

707
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:56,173
Haku, no!

708
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:18,779
Haku!

709
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:48,392
What is this?

710
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:49,977
Hold on there!

711
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:54,231
Haku!

712
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:59,278
Does it hurt?

713
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:05,033
This is serious.

714
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,287
Haku, don't give up.

715
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,205
What can we do? He'll die!

716
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:13,417
Something inside him
is eating him up.

717
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:14,626
Inside him?

718
01:26:14,752 --> 01:26:18,088
It's a strong spell.
There's nothing I can do.

719
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:21,675
Haku, the river guardian gave me this.

720
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:23,969
Eat it, maybe it will help.

721
01:26:26,222 --> 01:26:28,473
Haku, open your mouth.

722
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,310
Please Haku, eat it.

723
01:26:33,062 --> 01:26:34,855
See, it's safe.

724
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:37,232
Is it some kind of medicine?

725
01:26:37,483 --> 01:26:40,527
Open your mouth.
You can do it.

726
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,074
That's it.

727
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,618
Swallow it.

728
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:07,387
He spit something out.
That's it!

729
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:21,318
The seal!

730
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:23,320
It's getting away.
There! Over there!

731
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:45,717
Sen, we have to purge the spell.

732
01:27:49,889 --> 01:27:50,806
Begone!

733
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,725
Haku took this from Yubaba's sister.

734
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:56,728
From Zeniba? That's a witch's seal.

735
01:27:57,146 --> 01:27:59,273
Precious loot, I'd say.

736
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:03,777
I knew it was Haku.

737
01:28:03,903 --> 01:28:05,487
Kamaji, it's Haku!

738
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:08,657
Haku!

739
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,325
Haku, Haku!

740
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:14,621
Kamaji, he's not breathing.

741
01:28:14,747 --> 01:28:18,333
He is, but he's still
very ill from the spell.

742
01:28:27,593 --> 01:28:30,595
That should calm him some.

743
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:37,894
Haku turned up one day,
just like you.

744
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:40,856
He said he wanted to learn magic.

745
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:43,150
I tried to warn him.

746
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:46,945
Becoming a sorcerer's apprentice
is dangerous business.

747
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:49,865
But he wouldn't listen.
He kept saying...

748
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:51,742
that he'd lost his home.

749
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:55,412
So he signed up to be
Yubaba's apprentice.

750
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:58,999
He got paler and paler
as time went by...

751
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:02,044
and got a sharp
gleam in his eye.

752
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:08,091
Kamaji, I'm going to give
this back to Zeniba.

753
01:29:08,217 --> 01:29:11,928
Give it back, apologize,
and ask her to help Haku.

754
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:13,972
Tell me how to get there.

755
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:16,725
To Zeniba's house?

756
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:19,061
That's one scary sorceress.

757
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:19,978
Please.

758
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:24,232
Haku helped me.
Now I want to help him.

759
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:29,071
Well, getting there is one thing.

760
01:29:29,238 --> 01:29:31,156
Getting back's the problem.

761
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:33,241
Wait a minute.

762
01:29:35,661 --> 01:29:38,997
Let's see now,
they're here somewhere...

763
01:29:39,665 --> 01:29:42,751
Everyone, I need
my shoes and clothes.

764
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:54,096
Sen! I've been hunting
for you everywhere!

765
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:57,766
Lin...

766
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:00,560
Haku? What happened here?

767
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:02,270
Who are those guys?

768
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:04,815
My new friends.

769
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:05,649
Right?

770
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:09,069
Yubaba's looking for you.
She's hopping mad.

771
01:30:09,278 --> 01:30:12,906
That big tipper turned out
to be a No Face.

772
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:15,784
Yubaba says you let him in.

773
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:20,455
She might be right.

774
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:22,624
What, are you serious?

775
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:24,418
I thought he was a customer.

776
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:27,712
He's already swallowed
three of our people!

777
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:31,133
Found them.
Here they are, Sen.

778
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:33,176
We're busy, gramps.

779
01:30:33,302 --> 01:30:34,886
You can use these.

780
01:30:36,305 --> 01:30:39,099
Train tickets?
Where'd you get those?

781
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:41,685
Leftovers from 40 years ago.

782
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:45,564
You get off at the sixth stop,
called Swamp Bottom.

783
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:46,898
Swamp Bottom?

784
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:48,942
That's right, the sixth stop.

785
01:30:49,068 --> 01:30:50,068
Six.

786
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:54,030
Make sure you get it right.
There used to be a return train...

787
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:55,991
but these days it's one way only.

788
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,826
Still want to go?

789
01:30:57,952 --> 01:31:01,163
Yes, I'll walk back along the tracks.

790
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:04,624
What about Yubaba?

791
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:06,001
I'll talk to her now.

792
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:10,630
Haku, I promise I'll be back.
Please don't die.

793
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:12,924
What's going on here?

794
01:31:13,509 --> 01:31:15,969
Don't you understand? It's love.

795
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:26,188
It just keeps getting bigger!

796
01:31:26,355 --> 01:31:28,982
- Don't let it eat me!
- Here she comes.

797
01:31:36,532 --> 01:31:37,991
Thank goodness, Sen!

798
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:40,327
Yubaba can't control him.

799
01:31:43,539 --> 01:31:47,375
There's no need to get upset.
Sen will be here soon.

800
01:31:47,793 --> 01:31:50,295
Where's Sen? I want Sen!

801
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,255
Now hurry!

802
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:59,513
Yubaba, it's Sen.

803
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:01,014
Where were you?

804
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:05,560
Sen is here, honored guest.
She'll be right with you.

805
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:09,731
What took you so long?
This is a total disaster!

806
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:12,734
Win him over
and take all his gold.

807
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:18,949
What's this filthy rat?

808
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:23,161
Don't you recognize him?

809
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:26,164
Of course not.
How disgusting.

810
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:27,749
Now in you go.

811
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:31,503
Have a nice time.

812
01:32:32,421 --> 01:32:34,673
Will she be all right?

813
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:36,758
Want to take her place?

814
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,448
Try this, it's yummy.

815
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:06,830
Want some gold?
I've decided it's just for you.

816
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:12,586
Come over here.

817
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:16,339
What do you want?
You can tell me.

818
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:18,592
Where did you come from?

819
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:21,094
There's someplace
I have to go right away.

820
01:33:23,472 --> 01:33:25,932
You should go home.

821
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:29,102
You can't give me what I want.

822
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:33,982
Where's your home?
You must have a mom and dad.

823
01:33:34,817 --> 01:33:38,111
No... No...

824
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:42,824
I'm lonely... So lonely...

825
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:45,160
Are you lost?

826
01:33:45,536 --> 01:33:49,080
Sen... I want Sen.

827
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:50,832
Take the gold.

828
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:52,500
Would you eat me?

829
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:53,460
Take it.

830
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:54,461
Take it!

831
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:06,431
Before you eat me, eat this first.

832
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:11,061
I was saving it for my parents,
but you can have it.

833
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:33,291
Sen!

834
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:39,506
You little wench!
What did you feed me?

835
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,106
Watch out!

836
01:34:57,274 --> 01:34:59,109
Not in my house!

837
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,957
I'm over here!

838
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,084
Here!

839
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:02,505
You'll pay for this!

840
01:36:19,982 --> 01:36:22,025
Sen, down here!

841
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:40,627
Over here!

842
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:42,420
We don't need him.

843
01:36:46,425 --> 01:36:49,928
He needs to get out of there.
It's bad for him.

844
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:52,180
But where do we take him?

845
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:53,306
I don't know.

846
01:36:53,432 --> 01:36:54,849
Don't know?

847
01:36:55,309 --> 01:36:57,936
Great, now he's following us.

848
01:37:15,454 --> 01:37:17,539
- From here you walk.
- Okay.

849
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:19,374
You'll find the station.

850
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:20,959
Thanks.

851
01:37:21,585 --> 01:37:23,211
Be sure to come back!

852
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:24,420
I will.

853
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:32,053
Sen! I said you were a klutz.

854
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:33,721
I take it back!

855
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:46,109
No Face, hurt her
and you'll get it from me!

856
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:50,738
There it is.

857
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:04,669
The train's coming, let's hurry.

858
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:30,403
To Swamp Bottom, please.

859
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:38,661
You want to come too?

860
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:42,165
One more, please.

861
01:39:22,706 --> 01:39:24,040
Sit down.

862
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:26,334
Behave yourself, okay?

863
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:29,957
Kamaji.

864
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:34,921
Oh, Haku.
You're awake.

865
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,589
Kamaji, where's Sen?

866
01:41:37,007 --> 01:41:39,592
What happened? Please tell me.

867
01:41:39,843 --> 01:41:42,720
Don't you remember anything?

868
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:45,389
Just fragments.

869
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:48,684
Chihiro kept calling my name
in the darkness.

870
01:41:48,977 --> 01:41:52,980
I followed her voice
and woke up here.

871
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:58,236
Chihiro?
So her name is Chihiro.

872
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:02,365
Wonderful... It's the power of love.

873
01:42:06,036 --> 01:42:09,122
This gold will hardly cover the damage.

874
01:42:09,248 --> 01:42:12,166
That fool, Sen!
She just cost me a fortune.

875
01:42:12,668 --> 01:42:16,337
But we were saved, thanks to her.

876
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:17,630
Silence!

877
01:42:17,756 --> 01:42:20,174
She started the whole thing.

878
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,593
Now she's run away.

879
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:25,388
Abandoned her own parents!

880
01:42:26,056 --> 01:42:29,892
They must be fat enough.
Turn them into bacon or ham.

881
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:31,853
No, wait.

882
01:42:33,021 --> 01:42:34,147
Master Haku!

883
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:36,524
What, you're still alive?

884
01:42:38,902 --> 01:42:42,280
You still don't see it?
She's played a trick on you.

885
01:42:42,739 --> 01:42:45,533
You've gotten pretty fresh.

886
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:48,161
Since when do you talk that way?

887
01:43:39,796 --> 01:43:41,756
Bo?

888
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:49,388
Bo!

889
01:43:49,514 --> 01:43:50,514
Pebbles!

890
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:53,434
Bo!

891
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:57,772
Where are you, Bo?

892
01:43:58,106 --> 01:44:00,733
Please come out.

893
01:44:01,443 --> 01:44:02,735
Bo!

894
01:44:05,989 --> 01:44:08,282
Bo?

895
01:44:13,121 --> 01:44:17,458
Why, you little...

896
01:44:18,919 --> 01:44:22,046
Out with it!

897
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:27,635
Where did you hide my Bo?

898
01:44:28,136 --> 01:44:29,929
He's with Zeniba.

899
01:44:30,055 --> 01:44:32,014
Zeniba?

900
01:44:53,036 --> 01:44:56,706
Now I understand.
That evil witch.

901
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:59,542
She thinks she's beaten me.

902
01:45:01,211 --> 01:45:03,462
So, what's your plan?

903
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:06,007
I'll bring him back.

904
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:10,386
But you must send Sen and
her parents back to their world.

905
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:12,972
And what about you?

906
01:45:13,223 --> 01:45:16,976
Maybe I'll send them back
and then tear you to pieces.

907
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,566
I think this is right.

908
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:08,027
Come on.

909
01:46:34,846 --> 01:46:36,514
You can ride on my shoulder.

910
01:47:55,177 --> 01:47:56,594
Come in.

911
01:48:01,766 --> 01:48:03,559
Thank you.

912
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,938
Well, hurry up then.

913
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:09,732
Come on.

914
01:48:13,028 --> 01:48:14,862
So you all made it.

915
01:48:14,988 --> 01:48:17,406
- I...
- Have a seat.

916
01:48:17,532 --> 01:48:19,783
I'll make some tea.

917
01:48:25,624 --> 01:48:29,877
Zeniba, Haku stole this.
I came to give it back.

918
01:48:33,131 --> 01:48:35,591
Do you know what this is?

919
01:48:35,884 --> 01:48:38,802
No, but I know it's very precious.

920
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:42,556
I'm here to apologize for him.
He's sorry.

921
01:48:43,433 --> 01:48:46,477
You held this
and nothing happened to you?

922
01:48:46,603 --> 01:48:47,520
What?

923
01:48:47,646 --> 01:48:50,439
Wait, the protection spell is gone.

924
01:48:51,566 --> 01:48:54,735
I'm sorry.
There was this strange bug.

925
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:56,695
I squashed it.

926
01:48:57,239 --> 01:48:59,365
Squashed it!

927
01:49:01,409 --> 01:49:04,745
My sister snuck
that bug into the dragon...

928
01:49:04,871 --> 01:49:07,540
so she could control him.

929
01:49:07,666 --> 01:49:10,292
And you squashed it!

930
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,630
Now then, sit down.

931
01:49:14,798 --> 01:49:17,800
You must be No Face.
You sit, too.

932
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:22,429
Please turn them back into themselves.

933
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:25,599
Why my dear, the spell's long broken.

934
01:49:25,767 --> 01:49:28,143
They can change back any time.

935
01:49:35,443 --> 01:49:39,280
Yubaba and I are two halves of
a whole, but we don't get along.

936
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:41,949
You know what bad taste she has.

937
01:49:42,117 --> 01:49:45,160
Sorceress twins are
just a recipe for trouble.

938
01:49:49,207 --> 01:49:53,669
I'd like to help you dear,
but there's nothing I can do.

939
01:49:53,795 --> 01:49:55,838
It's one of our rules here.

940
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:59,300
You'll have to save your parents
and your dragon boyfriend...

941
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:01,051
all by yourself.

942
01:50:01,177 --> 01:50:04,096
But can't you
even give me a hint?

943
01:50:04,472 --> 01:50:07,933
I feel like Haku and I met
a long time ago.

944
01:50:08,101 --> 01:50:10,102
In that case it's easy.

945
01:50:10,395 --> 01:50:12,938
Everything that happens
stays inside you...

946
01:50:13,064 --> 01:50:15,316
even if you can't remember it.

947
01:50:16,651 --> 01:50:19,987
It's already late.
Why don't you stay the night?

948
01:50:20,405 --> 01:50:23,198
You boys give me a hand.

949
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:31,332
Come on, keep at it.

950
01:50:34,336 --> 01:50:36,837
See? You have a talent for this.

951
01:50:37,005 --> 01:50:38,631
You're a big help.

952
01:50:39,424 --> 01:50:42,676
It's not the same
when you use magic.

953
01:50:44,012 --> 01:50:48,349
Pull it through there.
Now do it again.

954
01:50:48,558 --> 01:50:51,185
Zeniba, I'm going back after all.

955
01:50:51,853 --> 01:50:55,314
Haku could die while I'm sitting here.

956
01:50:55,523 --> 01:50:59,026
And they might eat
my mom and dad!

957
01:51:01,196 --> 01:51:03,947
Wait just a little longer.

958
01:51:04,074 --> 01:51:05,616
There we are.

959
01:51:06,451 --> 01:51:08,410
Use it to tie back your hair.

960
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:14,500
It's pretty.

961
01:51:14,709 --> 01:51:19,630
It'll protect you.
I made it from the thread we spun.

962
01:51:19,881 --> 01:51:21,173
Thank you.

963
01:51:30,725 --> 01:51:34,520
What good timing.
We've got another guest, let him in.

964
01:51:34,646 --> 01:51:35,771
Sure.

965
01:51:49,077 --> 01:51:50,202
Haku!

966
01:51:51,413 --> 01:51:52,579
Haku...

967
01:51:53,415 --> 01:51:54,998
I'm so glad to see you.

968
01:51:55,333 --> 01:51:57,793
Are you okay?
Do you feel all right?

969
01:51:58,086 --> 01:51:59,086
Thank goodness.

970
01:52:00,922 --> 01:52:03,173
Good timing, I'd say.

971
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:06,301
Zeniba, Haku's alive.

972
01:52:06,845 --> 01:52:10,973
Haku, I no longer blame
you for what you did.

973
01:52:11,099 --> 01:52:14,476
But be sure to protect this girl.

974
01:52:14,769 --> 01:52:17,771
Okay boys, time you went home.

975
01:52:17,897 --> 01:52:19,940
Come see me again soon.

976
01:52:20,692 --> 01:52:25,028
You stay with me
and be my helper.

977
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:28,490
Zeniba!

978
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:31,285
Thank you, I'm going now.

979
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:34,455
Don't worry, I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.

980
01:52:34,622 --> 01:52:37,833
My real name is Chihiro.

981
01:52:37,959 --> 01:52:40,461
Chihiro? What a nice name.

982
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:42,463
Take good care of it.

983
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:43,255
I will!

984
01:52:43,381 --> 01:52:45,174
Now off you go.

985
01:52:46,885 --> 01:52:49,970
Thank you, Zeniba.
Goodbye!

986
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:40,521
Haku, listen.

987
01:53:40,855 --> 01:53:44,483
I don't remember this,
but my mom told me about it.

988
01:53:44,859 --> 01:53:48,487
Once when I was little,
I fell in a river.

989
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:52,574
Now it's all built over.
It flows underground.

990
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:55,077
But I just remembered.

991
01:53:56,204 --> 01:53:57,871
The river was called...

992
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:01,416
it was called the Kohaku River.

993
01:54:02,043 --> 01:54:05,045
Your real name is Kohaku.

994
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:28,110
Chihiro, thank you!

995
01:54:28,236 --> 01:54:31,488
My name is
Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

996
01:54:31,906 --> 01:54:35,117
- Nigihayami?
- Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

997
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:37,995
What a name!
Sounds like a guardian spirit.

998
01:54:38,329 --> 01:54:42,749
I remember how
you fell into me as a child.

999
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:44,585
You were chasing your shoe.

1000
01:54:44,794 --> 01:54:49,131
Yes, and you carried me
to shallow water.

1001
01:54:50,008 --> 01:54:51,258
I'm so happy...

1002
01:55:24,042 --> 01:55:25,459
They're back!

1003
01:55:38,806 --> 01:55:41,433
You brought Bo back with you?

1004
01:55:44,312 --> 01:55:45,228
Baba!

1005
01:55:45,355 --> 01:55:49,775
Bo! You're not hurt?
What a terrible time you had.

1006
01:55:51,027 --> 01:55:54,154
Bo, when did you learn
to stand on your own?

1007
01:55:54,739 --> 01:55:56,657
Yubaba, remember your promise.

1008
01:55:56,908 --> 01:55:59,910
Send Chihiro and her parents
back to their world.

1009
01:56:00,328 --> 01:56:02,746
Sorry, but it's not that simple.

1010
01:56:02,872 --> 01:56:05,999
This world has rules, you know.

1011
01:56:06,626 --> 01:56:07,793
Silence!

1012
01:56:07,919 --> 01:56:10,545
Just do it, Baba.
Don't be so mean.

1013
01:56:10,838 --> 01:56:13,423
Baby had such a good time.

1014
01:56:13,925 --> 01:56:16,677
But I'm just following the rule.

1015
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:19,179
Otherwise I can't break the spell.

1016
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:22,557
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore.

1017
01:56:22,850 --> 01:56:24,184
But...

1018
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:25,477
Granny!

1019
01:56:25,687 --> 01:56:27,062
Granny?

1020
01:56:27,397 --> 01:56:29,022
I'll do as you ask.

1021
01:56:40,868 --> 01:56:42,995
Haku told me about the rule.

1022
01:56:43,121 --> 01:56:44,913
Well, you've got guts.

1023
01:56:45,123 --> 01:56:48,375
I brought your contract.
Follow me.

1024
01:56:48,543 --> 01:56:50,585
This won't take a minute, Bo.

1025
01:56:51,587 --> 01:56:53,088
Don't worry.

1026
01:56:57,552 --> 01:57:01,388
See if you can pick out
your parents for me.

1027
01:57:10,732 --> 01:57:12,149
You get one guess.

1028
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:14,943
Pick them out
and you all go free.

1029
01:57:26,789 --> 01:57:30,459
Granny, I can't do it.
Dad and Mom aren't here.

1030
01:57:30,626 --> 01:57:34,212
Not here?
Is that your answer?

1031
01:57:35,757 --> 01:57:36,798
Yes.

1032
01:57:39,594 --> 01:57:42,888
You're right!

1033
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:45,515
Attagirl! Good for you.

1034
01:57:49,479 --> 01:57:50,645
Thank you everyone.

1035
01:57:50,772 --> 01:57:54,024
All right!
You win, just get out of here.

1036
01:57:54,525 --> 01:57:56,443
Thanks for everything.

1037
01:57:56,986 --> 01:57:58,487
Goodbye.

1038
01:57:58,946 --> 01:57:59,946
Thank you.

1039
01:58:00,114 --> 01:58:01,490
See you soon.

1040
01:58:01,783 --> 01:58:03,533
- Haku!
- Let's go.

1041
01:58:04,202 --> 01:58:05,410
Where's Mom and Dad?

1042
01:58:05,536 --> 01:58:06,828
They went on ahead.

1043
01:58:14,378 --> 01:58:15,462
The water's gone.

1044
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:17,380
I can't go any further.

1045
01:58:17,799 --> 01:58:20,133
Go back the way you came.

1046
01:58:20,301 --> 01:58:23,386
But don't look back
until you're out of the tunnel.

1047
01:58:23,554 --> 01:58:25,639
But what about you?

1048
01:58:26,057 --> 01:58:28,809
I'll tell Yubaba
I'm quitting my apprenticeship.

1049
01:58:28,976 --> 01:58:31,520
I'm fine now.
I have my name back.

1050
01:58:32,063 --> 01:58:33,855
Now I can go home too.

1051
01:58:33,981 --> 01:58:35,315
Will we meet again somewhere?

1052
01:58:35,483 --> 01:58:36,983
- I'm sure of it.
- Promise?

1053
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:37,943
Promise.

1054
01:58:38,069 --> 01:58:40,362
Now go, and don't look back.

1055
01:59:03,427 --> 01:59:05,011
Chihiro!

1056
01:59:05,346 --> 01:59:08,014
Where have you been?
Hurry up.

1057
01:59:11,519 --> 01:59:13,353
Mom! Dad!

1058
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:15,188
Don't go running off like that.

1059
01:59:15,356 --> 01:59:16,356
Let's go.

1060
01:59:17,024 --> 01:59:19,234
Mom, are you really okay?

1061
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:23,613
Hurry, the moving van
will be there.

1062
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:35,250
Hurry up, Chihiro.

1063
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:45,719
Watch your step.

1064
01:59:45,845 --> 01:59:49,181
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.

1065
02:00:01,402 --> 02:00:02,861
The end of the tunnel.

1066
02:00:03,237 --> 02:00:04,487
Hey!

1067
02:00:04,822 --> 02:00:06,198
What is it?

1068
02:00:06,782 --> 02:00:08,909
Will you look at that.

1069
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:12,162
It's all dusty inside, too.

1070
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:14,497
- Is this somebody's joke?
- I wonder...

1071
02:00:14,624 --> 02:00:17,042
I told you not to stop here.

1072
02:00:22,757 --> 02:00:25,258
That's it, you're fine.

1073
02:00:26,510 --> 02:00:28,762
We're off, Chihiro.

1074
02:00:28,888 --> 02:00:31,598
Chihiro! Hurry up!

1075
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:58,500
Voices

1076
02:00:59,335 --> 02:01:04,381
