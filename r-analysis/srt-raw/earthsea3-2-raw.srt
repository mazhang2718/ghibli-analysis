1
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:11,353
Arren! I can't find Therru.
Check the back pasture for me.

2
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:14,430
Tell her to come inside
before dark.

3
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:15,867
I will.

4
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:34,874
Therru?

5
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:40,985
Therru...

6
00:00:41,226 --> 00:00:47,392
<i>Far, far above the clouds</i>
<i>against the setting sun</i>

7
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:54,762
<i>A falcon flies alone</i>
<i>soaring in the wind</i>

8
00:00:55,273 --> 00:01:01,974
<i>I hear his lonely cry</i>
<i>so sad must he be</i>

9
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:08,683
<i>Riding the silent wind</i>
<i>a falcon flies alone</i>

10
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:16,053
<i>Reaching out with his wings</i>
<i>grasps the empty sky</i>

11
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:23,164
<i>Riding the silent wind</i>
<i>never can he rest</i>

12
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:31,664
<i>What it is within my heart</i>
<i>none can ever know</i>

13
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:38,614
<i>A heart like a falcon's</i>
<i>is this very heart</i>

14
00:01:39,384 --> 00:01:45,584
<i>What it is within my heart</i>
<i>none can ever know</i>

15
00:01:45,924 --> 00:01:53,262
<i>Lonely falcon in the empty sky</i>

16
00:01:55,099 --> 00:02:01,504
<i>I walk alone along</i>
<i>deserted country roads</i>

17
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:08,508
<i>Walking with me side by side</i>
<i>you are always there</i>

18
00:02:09,314 --> 00:02:15,810
<i>I feel your loneliness</i>
<i>lonely you must be</i>

19
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:22,657
<i>Crickets whispering</i>
<i>in the grassy fields</i>

20
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:29,695
<i>You walk there by my side</i>
<i>you walk the path with me</i>

21
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:37,134
<i>But you never say a word</i>
<i>never do you speak</i>

22
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:45,774
<i>What it is within my heart</i>
<i>none can ever know</i>

23
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:52,916
<i>Here inside this heart</i>
<i>that walks its path alone</i>

24
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:59,693
<i>What it is within my heart</i>
<i>none can ever know</i>

25
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:07,233
<i>The sadness of one</i>
<i>who always is alone</i>

26
00:03:26,324 --> 00:03:28,758
I killed my father.

27
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:33,057
I stabbed him and ran away.

28
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:36,995
I don't understand it.
Why did I kill him?

29
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:39,602
Did he hurt you?

30
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,233
No. My father
was a great man.

31
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:48,642
I am nothing. I failed my father
and I fail myself.

32
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,411
And yet, I'm filled
with a rage I can't control.

33
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:59,553
It's as if there were
someone else inside me.

34
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,682
You saw it too, didn't you?

35
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,860
You were right.
I shouldn't be here.

36
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,788
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

37
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,867
No, you were right.

38
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:15,097
If I don't leave,
it will come again.

39
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:28,650
A woman?

40
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:31,415
She lives past the marshes.

41
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:35,419
And the Archmage is with her?

42
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:40,421
He was seen in the town.
There are many witnesses.

43
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:42,555
Splendid.

44
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:51,168
My lord.

45
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:55,139
Let's go, men!

46
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,458
A greeting from the Archmage.
Thank you, Sparrowhawk.

47
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,577
Therru! Arren!
Dinner is ready!

48
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:39,653
Where's Arren?

49
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:42,515
Isn't he with you?

50
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:43,594
No.

51
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:48,188
Maybe he's resting.
Therru, go see if he's there.

52
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:49,459
Yes, Tenar.

53
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,198
He's not here.

54
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:57,941
That's strange.
Where's he gone?

55
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,201
I'll look outside.

56
00:06:17,495 --> 00:06:18,860
Arren...

57
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,344
Tenar, Therru... take care.

58
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:04,430
Doesn't matter
which way I go.

59
00:07:16,254 --> 00:07:17,619
Looks like a dead end.

60
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:39,470
It's here!

61
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,816
I wonder if that's Arren?

62
00:08:59,357 --> 00:09:00,585
Arren?

63
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:02,858
Sparrowhawk?

64
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:12,129
That's odd.

65
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:14,395
What are you doing?

66
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:17,631
It's you! You're back!

67
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:22,779
So sorry, but it seems
you'll do in place of the wizard.

68
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,574
What?

69
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:25,114
Tenar, what's wrong?

70
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:26,080
Run away!

71
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:27,775
What a surprise!

72
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:31,252
Fancy meeting you here, princess.

73
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:35,784
No! Leave her alone!

74
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,701
Therru!

75
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,696
Well now princess,
where's your prince?

76
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,599
Hey! Watch those teeth!

77
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:56,604
I need you to deliver a message.
Tell this to the wizard!

78
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:59,375
If he wants his woman...

79
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:03,510
...he can find her
at Lord Cob's castle.

80
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:05,522
Take her away!

81
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:06,487
Therru!

82
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,353
Tenar!

83
00:10:09,293 --> 00:10:13,252
Let me go, I tell you!
Let me go!

84
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,496
Therru!
Are you all right? Therru!

85
00:10:20,738 --> 00:10:22,831
Stop it! Let her go!

86
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,934
You stay here and be good
till the wizard gets back!

87
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:31,979
Lord Cob's waiting.
Let's get moving!

88
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,712
Tenar!

89
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,387
Tenar!

90
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:16,522
I'm sorry. I'm afraid
he's coming with me.

91
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:22,762
Go!

92
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,021
Where am I?

93
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:56,925
You're safe now.
The Shadow can't follow you here.

94
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,233
You saw it?

95
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,939
I know a bit of Magic myself.

96
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,235
I know what
you're running from.

97
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:10,404
You were wise
to flee from that man.

98
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:12,438
What man?

99
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,418
Sparrowhawk.
That is, the Archmage.

100
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:21,322
Here, drink this.
It will soothe you.

101
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:29,221
What's wrong?
It's not poisoned.

102
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:47,715
Now lie still
and rest here for a bit.

103
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:52,318
The Archmage is more dangerous
than you can imagine.

104
00:12:52,957 --> 00:12:55,892
No... Sparrowhawk is a good man.

105
00:12:55,993 --> 00:12:58,325
He protected me.

106
00:12:58,963 --> 00:13:03,696
Then tell me. Did you ever
wonder what he seeks?

107
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,696
No.

108
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,336
He seeks eternal life.

109
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:15,835
Eternal life?

110
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:21,273
The Archmage stands
at the pinnacle of sorcery.

111
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:26,648
Only the secret of eternal life
lies beyond his grasp.

112
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:29,991
And yet, he covets it.

113
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:34,924
But as he covets, so does he fear
another will discover it first.

114
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:40,570
That would be unbearable
to one so proud as the Archmage.

115
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:43,740
What does that have
to do with me?

116
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:48,335
Because it is you
who have been chosen...

117
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:51,005
...to gain the secret
of eternal life.

118
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:56,611
That's why Sparrowhawk
follows you. To kill you.

119
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,779
To bring me death...

120
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:02,516
Arren, will you come with me?

121
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:04,685
I've already found it.

122
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:08,424
I found the door
between life and death.

123
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:12,164
Together we can open that door.

124
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,870
And together,
we will live forever.

125
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:18,533
We will conquer every form
of fear and suffering.

126
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:21,176
Fear and suffering...

127
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:26,681
Come with me, Arren.
The face of death is terrible!

128
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:33,184
I don't want to die.

129
00:14:33,557 --> 00:14:37,516
Listen to me, Arren.
Tell me your True Name.

130
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:41,189
Then you will have that
which you most desire.

131
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:48,230
Come, give me your True Name.

132
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:54,203
Lebannen...

133
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:04,281
Now I'm ready for you,
Sparrowhawk.

134
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:15,925
Where are you, Hawk?

135
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,801
Hawk!

136
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:58,038
What's wrong, Therru?

137
00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:01,843
They came and took
Tenar away!

138
00:16:02,146 --> 00:16:04,808
You have to go
to Cob's castle!

139
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:06,109
Where is Arren?

140
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,110
He left! He said it would
come again if he didn't go!

141
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:13,623
Cob...

142
00:16:14,258 --> 00:16:16,123
Don't worry, Therru.

143
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:21,622
I'm going to help Tenar.
Wait for my return.

144
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:26,630
Keep this sword.
Arren will need it.

145
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:36,311
Stay home, Therru!

146
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:52,151
Here-we-are!

147
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:57,700
Come on!

148
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,396
I'm not going anywhere!

149
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:05,766
Lord Cob.

150
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:10,107
We brought the woman.
Just as you ordered.

151
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:14,041
You've done well, Hare.

152
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:19,515
It was nothing, my lord.
My pleasure is to serve you.

153
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:20,983
Stand aside!

154
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:22,856
Why, you!

155
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,659
Are you the boss?

156
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:28,690
Why did you kidnap me?
Let me go right now!

157
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,268
So sorry for the rough treatment.

158
00:17:32,536 --> 00:17:34,663
I have business with Sparrowhawk.

159
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:40,033
You're a wizard, aren't you!
You should be ashamed!

160
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:42,438
Go find him yourself!

161
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:45,710
He's an old friend of mine.

162
00:17:45,883 --> 00:17:48,943
I'd like to invite him here.

163
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,315
And I'm the bait!
You're going to hurt him!

164
00:17:53,757 --> 00:17:56,726
Women tax my patience.

165
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:59,161
Put her in the dungeon.

166
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,425
Do it!

167
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:03,833
Answer me!

168
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:07,966
If something happens to
Sparrowhawk, so help me!

169
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:11,364
- Arren...
- This way!

170
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:26,017
Come, Lebannen.
I have something special for you.

171
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:54,815
Get in there!

172
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:07,693
Make yourself at home.
You'll see your wizard soon enough.

173
00:19:24,614 --> 00:19:28,846
This place reminds me
of the Tombs.

174
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:32,354
Sparrowhawk...

175
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:47,728
Cob! Are you making
the same mistake again?

176
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:56,871
At ease!

177
00:19:57,714 --> 00:19:58,942
Any sign of the wizard?

178
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:00,983
Not yet, sir.

179
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:05,248
Where is that confounded wizard?

180
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:09,257
Let's see...

181
00:20:13,263 --> 00:20:16,323
There he is!
Take your positions!

182
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:25,905
Here he comes!

183
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:34,081
Don't let him escape! Now!

184
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:40,287
Hear me! Open the path!

185
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:45,887
Stop! Wait!

186
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:49,061
He tricked us!

187
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,396
Well? Don't just stand there!

188
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:01,670
Cob! It's Sparrowhawk.
I'm here!

189
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:03,507
Show yourself!

190
00:21:07,484 --> 00:21:10,817
It's been a long time,
Sparrowhawk.

191
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:13,312
I've been waiting.

192
00:21:14,057 --> 00:21:16,992
Cob of Havnor!
I left you at the border...

193
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,923
...of the land of death.

194
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:22,757
I hear you're the Archmage now.

195
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,694
Congratulations.

196
00:21:25,335 --> 00:21:29,135
I'm here, Cob.
Now release Tenar!

197
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:32,737
You're pitiful, Sparrowhawk.

198
00:21:32,843 --> 00:21:37,177
The great Archmage,
smitten by a woman.

199
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:41,176
You used her to lure me here.
What do you want?

200
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:43,547
What do you think?

201
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:46,019
I haven't forgotten
how you dragged me...

202
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:48,785
...to the gates of the Dry Land.

203
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:51,525
But you've forgotten why!

204
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:54,392
You used
the Pelnish Lore...

205
00:21:54,498 --> 00:21:57,934
...to toy with the spirits
of the living and the dead.

206
00:21:58,034 --> 00:22:00,059
Isn't that enough to repent?

207
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:04,902
You taught me a splendid lesson
there at death's door.

208
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:08,143
Now I know I can
never accept extinction.

209
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:12,779
So I gathered every
ancient lore book I could find.

210
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:17,019
Alas, some of their owners
were not cooperative.

211
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:21,521
What evil are you planning, Cob?

212
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,992
I've done it, Sparrowhawk!

213
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:28,223
I've woven the greatest spell of all.

214
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:31,830
The door between life and death
has been closed...

215
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:35,530
...since the beginning of time.
But I will open it!

216
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,605
That is forbidden!
Don't you understand?

217
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:43,475
Those with power
must wield it with wisdom.

218
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,548
Would you destroy the Balance
that sustains the world?

219
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:49,313
What nonsense!

220
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:52,479
The Balance is long gone.

221
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:56,125
You know that
better than anyone.

222
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:58,554
The Balance was destroyed by Man.

223
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:04,558
You think you can limit
Man's desire? It's impossible!

224
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:07,566
I will live forever.

225
00:23:07,671 --> 00:23:10,572
I will gain existence without end!

226
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:16,309
Cob! Without the cycle
of death and rebirth, there is no life!

227
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:19,280
I am above Nature!

228
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:29,820
Sparrowhawk! There's someone else
who wants to meet you.

229
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:41,460
Arren! What are you doing here?

230
00:23:41,571 --> 00:23:46,099
Lebannen! This man would
deprive you of eternal life!

231
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,946
Arren! Did you reveal
your True Name?

232
00:23:58,154 --> 00:24:01,590
I'm going to live forever!

233
00:24:04,894 --> 00:24:08,591
I'm tired, Sparrowhawk.
Tired of living in fear.

234
00:24:09,065 --> 00:24:12,330
Arren! Life without death is not life!

235
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:16,602
Refuse death, and
you refuse life as well!

236
00:24:17,807 --> 00:24:19,536
Don't lie to me!

237
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:40,496
Listen to me, Arren.

238
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,828
No man nor any thing
in this world lives forever.

239
00:24:46,002 --> 00:24:49,563
But only to us is it given
to know that we must die.

240
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:54,076
And that is a precious gift.

241
00:24:55,145 --> 00:25:00,447
This life that is our torment
and our treasure does not endure.

242
00:25:00,884 --> 00:25:02,875
It is a wave on the sea.

243
00:25:02,986 --> 00:25:07,116
Would you force the sea
to grow still, to save one wave?

244
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,349
To save yourself?

245
00:25:20,303 --> 00:25:21,497
Arren...

246
00:25:31,981 --> 00:25:34,381
Thought you made
a fool of me?

247
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:38,049
There's more than
one entrance to this castle!

248
00:25:38,888 --> 00:25:42,016
What's happening?
I'm getting weak.

249
00:25:43,226 --> 00:25:47,492
Coming here was another
of your blunders, Sparrowhawk.

250
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:50,394
Your powers are useless
in this place.

251
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:54,670
Hare! Put him in the
dungeon with the woman.

252
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,669
I'll finish them tomorrow...

253
00:25:57,173 --> 00:26:00,370
...in the most painful
and humiliating way.

254
00:26:01,077 --> 00:26:02,271
Yes, my lord.

255
00:26:02,512 --> 00:26:04,946
On your feet, chickenhawk!

256
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:29,335
Sparrowhawk!

257
00:26:29,773 --> 00:26:33,470
Sparrowhawk! Are you all right?
Sparrowhawk!

258
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,538
It'll all be over tomorrow.

259
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:39,046
Say your goodbyes
while you still have time!

260
00:26:49,926 --> 00:26:52,121
Sparrowhawk! Sparrowhawk!

261
00:26:52,996 --> 00:26:54,327
Tenar...

262
00:26:54,431 --> 00:26:58,162
How did they do this?
You're the Archmage!

263
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:02,799
I'm sorry, Tenar.
I keep getting you into trouble.

264
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,337
Stop talking nonsense!

265
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,424
Which way should I go?

266
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:32,160
Arren?

267
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:39,569
Arren! Wait!

268
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:45,070
Arren! Cob's men came
and took Tenar away!

269
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:56,751
I have your sword!

270
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,023
Sparrowhawk said
to give it to you!

271
00:28:07,303 --> 00:28:08,861
Follow you?

272
00:28:49,078 --> 00:28:52,445
Tenar is a prisoner here.

273
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:53,846
Sparrowhawk too.

274
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:56,308
Even Sparrowhawk.

275
00:28:56,719 --> 00:29:00,587
This is yours, isn't it?
Sparrowhawk brought it for you.

276
00:29:02,025 --> 00:29:05,085
We've got to hurry.
They need our help!

277
00:29:06,563 --> 00:29:10,624
I can go no further.
You must go alone.

278
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:14,393
Bring me that sword.

279
00:29:15,204 --> 00:29:16,831
I know you can do it.

280
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:21,340
What do you mean?
You're right here.

281
00:29:22,078 --> 00:29:24,069
I'm not here.

282
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:27,846
Cob is holding me
against my will.

283
00:29:28,384 --> 00:29:30,443
Then who are you?

284
00:29:30,954 --> 00:29:33,047
Stay away! Get back!

285
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:35,619
Don't come closer!

286
00:29:41,764 --> 00:29:44,528
Arren's heart was always
full of fear.

287
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:48,634
The fear filled his heart
with darkness.

288
00:29:50,006 --> 00:29:51,633
Fear of what?

289
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:56,176
The darkness stole his body
and ran away with it.

290
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:59,379
But it left something
important behind.

291
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:09,348
Wherever there is darkness,
there also you will find light.

292
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:11,893
Now the light
that was left behind...

293
00:30:12,328 --> 00:30:14,523
...wanders alone,
like a shadow.

294
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:16,458
A shadow?

295
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:23,397
What you see now is just
a shadow chasing its body.

296
00:30:30,947 --> 00:30:32,039
Father...

297
00:30:34,684 --> 00:30:36,675
You are Arren, aren't you?

298
00:30:38,855 --> 00:30:42,222
Don't worry.
I'll be with you.

299
00:30:43,993 --> 00:30:45,824
I'll give you my True Name.

300
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:51,328
My True Name
is Lebannen... Lebannen.

301
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,569
Lebannen...

302
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:09,439
It's him.

303
00:32:13,082 --> 00:32:16,108
He should be ashamed
to call himself Archmage!

304
00:32:16,219 --> 00:32:19,518
Remember who
he was up against.

305
00:32:19,622 --> 00:32:21,817
No wizard in Earthsea
is a match for Lord Cob!

306
00:32:21,924 --> 00:32:23,414
Well spoken!

307
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:28,860
By the way, what's our
little friend up to?

308
00:32:28,965 --> 00:32:31,456
He shut himself in his room.

309
00:32:32,468 --> 00:32:34,459
Arren's really here!

310
00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:37,531
He's a lucky one, that boy.

311
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,407
It's just like Lord Cob
to steal the wizard's apprentice.

312
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:45,481
He's not much
use though, is he?

313
00:32:45,982 --> 00:32:47,279
None at all.

314
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:51,217
When we're through with
the wizard, we'll sell the boy!

315
00:33:00,763 --> 00:33:03,698
All right! Go get
Sparrowhawk and his woman.

316
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,702
The Archmage's time
has finally run out!

317
00:33:09,772 --> 00:33:11,706
They're going to kill them.

318
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:28,885
Arren!

319
00:34:30,553 --> 00:34:31,713
Arren?

320
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,887
What are you doing here?
Did they kidnap you too?

321
00:34:46,702 --> 00:34:49,296
Here. This belongs to you.

322
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:52,974
I'm not worthy to hold
my father's sword.

323
00:34:54,644 --> 00:34:57,442
Arren, they've got Tenar
and Sparrowhawk.

324
00:34:57,546 --> 00:34:59,241
They're going to kill them.

325
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:02,340
Please! Help them
like you helped me!

326
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:05,053
I can't help anyone.

327
00:35:05,221 --> 00:35:08,315
All I can do is fail.

328
00:35:08,424 --> 00:35:10,392
What's wrong with you?

329
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:13,257
They'll die
if we don't do something!

330
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:21,134
They'll die!
We'll lose both of them!

331
00:35:30,413 --> 00:35:34,008
We'll lose the most important
thing in the world.

332
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:39,282
Therru?

333
00:35:42,591 --> 00:35:45,116
What's the most important thing?

334
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,128
Life is the most important thing!

335
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:56,831
We'll all die someday.
What does it matter?

336
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:02,503
Why fight for life?
We know it's going to end anyway.

337
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:06,578
No! Life is precious because
we know we're going to die!

338
00:36:06,682 --> 00:36:11,244
You're not afraid of death.
You're afraid of life!

339
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:14,588
You want to live forever,
then you say nothing matters.

340
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,851
It's the same thing!

341
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:19,985
You're afraid to live
the only life you have!

342
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:22,260
Therru...

343
00:36:22,565 --> 00:36:24,897
You think your life
belongs to you?

344
00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:31,538
Tenar gave me life.
That's why I have to live...

345
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,666
...to give life to someone else.

346
00:36:38,414 --> 00:36:39,847
Lebannen...

347
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:44,177
That's the only way
we live forever.

348
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:02,097
Therru... how did you know
my True Name?

349
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:04,573
You told me yourself.

350
00:37:07,576 --> 00:37:11,910
Now I'll tell you mine.
My True Name is...

351
00:37:12,081 --> 00:37:15,050
Tehanu... it's Tehanu.

352
00:37:15,951 --> 00:37:17,543
Tehanu...

353
00:37:40,643 --> 00:37:42,543
It'll be dawn soon.

354
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,105
Come on, Therru.
We've got to help them!

355
00:37:56,258 --> 00:37:57,156
Arren, wait!

356
00:37:58,194 --> 00:37:59,024
What is it?

357
00:37:59,128 --> 00:38:00,095
There!

358
00:38:05,734 --> 00:38:07,668
It's Sparrowhawk and Tenar!

359
00:38:08,504 --> 00:38:09,596
Come on!

360
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:15,101
Jump!

361
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,702
I can't! It's too far!

362
00:38:17,813 --> 00:38:19,678
Don't worry!
You can do it!

363
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:27,982
Let's go!

364
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,215
Sparrowhawk!

365
00:38:58,154 --> 00:39:01,146
Time to say goodbye,
Sparrowhawk.

366
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,955
Your lover is going
on a journey.

367
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,551
Why don't you
send him off yourself?

368
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:16,602
Don't worry, Sparrowhawk.

369
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:19,706
This world will be
in good hands after you're gone.

370
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:24,039
What can I do, Sparrowhawk?

371
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,710
Tenar.

372
00:39:26,515 --> 00:39:30,713
It's not over yet.
The sun will rise soon.

373
00:39:32,421 --> 00:39:33,945
What do you mean?

374
00:39:35,257 --> 00:39:40,285
Don't you hear it, Tenar?
Help is almost here.

375
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:46,595
That's enough time
for goodbyes.

376
00:39:46,735 --> 00:39:49,101
Do it! Finish him!

377
00:39:49,205 --> 00:39:50,433
No!

378
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:55,567
Let them go!

379
00:39:56,378 --> 00:39:57,345
It's you!

380
00:39:57,446 --> 00:39:58,913
Arren! Therru!

381
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:01,647
Stay out of this, boy!

382
00:40:02,751 --> 00:40:05,117
Don't show him any mercy!

383
00:40:05,721 --> 00:40:06,949
Get back!

384
00:40:12,261 --> 00:40:13,489
Take him!

385
00:40:25,474 --> 00:40:27,339
Please don't hurt me!

386
00:40:28,244 --> 00:40:29,939
I'm disappointed.

387
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:33,338
I thought you
and I had an understanding.

388
00:40:33,882 --> 00:40:37,340
Silence!
You don't control me any ore.

389
00:40:37,786 --> 00:40:42,155
Then you shall see
the face of death, Lebannen!

390
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:49,830
A summoning spell!

391
00:40:55,337 --> 00:40:55,996
Arren!

392
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:57,538
Stay back!

393
00:40:59,275 --> 00:41:00,799
Now die!

394
00:41:20,996 --> 00:41:23,692
Please! Let me draw it.

395
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:26,330
For Life!

396
00:42:03,972 --> 00:42:07,408
That sword was
forged with magic!

397
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:32,827
He's an old man!

398
00:42:33,435 --> 00:42:35,630
Disguised by sorcery.

399
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:37,896
Lord Cob!

400
00:42:40,909 --> 00:42:42,968
You can't stop me.

401
00:42:43,345 --> 00:42:46,143
I will never accept death.

402
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,275
Wizards shouldn't fear death!

403
00:42:50,886 --> 00:42:52,786
You wretched girl!

404
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:55,416
I'm not like you!

405
00:42:55,524 --> 00:42:58,288
I'm better than you.
Insignificant worms!

406
00:42:58,894 --> 00:43:01,294
I studied the wisdom of the ages!

407
00:43:01,397 --> 00:43:04,924
I wield power! I am almighty!

408
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:11,263
Scorned as a fool by
the wizards of Roke.

409
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,465
Driven out like a dog!

410
00:43:15,444 --> 00:43:19,608
But I'll have my revenge.
I will never die.

411
00:43:19,715 --> 00:43:22,980
I'll be the supreme Archmage!

412
00:43:38,267 --> 00:43:39,325
Therru!

413
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,424
Therru!

414
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,078
That little fool!

415
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:28,878
Hear me, stones.
I unbind you!

416
00:45:19,434 --> 00:45:21,527
Sunrise...

417
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,734
Let me go!

418
00:45:30,178 --> 00:45:31,475
Does it hurt, girl?

419
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,706
Cob!

420
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,910
Let her go!

421
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:38,114
Stay back!

422
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,553
Death is terrifying!

423
00:45:42,457 --> 00:45:43,481
Don't do it!

424
00:45:47,095 --> 00:45:50,155
So terrifying.

425
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:55,734
Wait!

426
00:46:18,994 --> 00:46:23,124
So terrifying... very terrifying...

427
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,796
Cob! You're just like me.

428
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:30,696
You turn away from light
and see only darkness!

429
00:46:32,674 --> 00:46:34,608
No! Keep away!

430
00:46:36,945 --> 00:46:39,709
You forgot that all life
is connected.

431
00:46:39,815 --> 00:46:42,807
Life can't be hoarded,
it can only be given!

432
00:46:43,485 --> 00:46:46,648
Deny death,
and you deny life!

433
00:46:47,155 --> 00:46:49,715
No! You're wrong!

434
00:46:51,026 --> 00:46:54,826
Face the truth, Cob!
Everyone fears death!

435
00:46:56,331 --> 00:47:00,700
No! I don't want to die.

436
00:47:01,937 --> 00:47:02,835
Cob!

437
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:05,165
No!

438
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:07,470
Therru!

439
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,750
Therru... Arren...

440
00:47:30,232 --> 00:47:31,460
Arren!

441
00:47:41,743 --> 00:47:44,268
Time to die! Time to die!

442
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:45,607
Arren!

443
00:47:46,415 --> 00:47:48,975
And you will join him.

444
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:57,785
Let her go! Don't kill her!

445
00:48:00,595 --> 00:48:04,588
All who oppose me must die!

446
00:48:34,362 --> 00:48:38,162
She's dead, she's dead.
Poor thing.

447
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,137
Sun is rising.

448
00:48:55,117 --> 00:48:58,143
Hurry... must hurry...

449
00:48:58,253 --> 00:48:59,743
Stop!

450
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:38,355
Therru!

451
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:49,834
Eternal life!

452
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:57,335
Shadow, return to darkness!

453
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:01,246
Give me life!

454
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:10,253
I want life... life!

455
00:50:17,299 --> 00:50:18,766
Life!

456
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:27,268
I want to live!

457
00:50:57,572 --> 00:51:00,507
Tehanu!

458
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:45,845
So you're safe too.

459
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:52,459
What about them?

460
00:51:53,428 --> 00:51:57,455
They'll be fine.
They have wings.

461
00:53:20,915 --> 00:53:23,315
Thank you... Therru.

462
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:32,783
I'm going back
to pay for my crime.

463
00:53:33,762 --> 00:53:36,196
And to face myself.

464
00:53:38,366 --> 00:53:39,492
Arren.

465
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:45,166
Can I come to see you
again someday?

466
00:53:50,945 --> 00:53:51,934
Come on.

467
00:53:52,247 --> 00:53:55,739
We have to thank
Sparrowhawk and Tenar.

<i>The lone hawk in the sky</i>

<i>Here there is only light and darkness</i>

471

<i>You who looked up to the sky and wept</i>

472
00:54:52,941 --> 00:55:00,575
<i>You who live alone</i>

473
00:55:01,015 --> 00:55:08,080
<i>Let me hear your True Name</i>

474
00:55:08,323 --> 00:55:18,699
<i>For one day you'll be gone</i>

475
00:55:20,602 --> 00:55:27,633
<i>As light dissolves into darkness</i>

476
00:55:28,243 --> 00:55:35,877
<i>Your song passes straight</i>
<i>through my heart</i>

477

<i>Let me sing it for you</i>
