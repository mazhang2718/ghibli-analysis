1
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:12,386
Tokuma Shoten, Yamato Transport and
Nippon Television Network present

2
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,855
Now the latest weather forecast
for northwest Koriko.

3
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,317
Skies are clearing up,
thanks to a high-pressure front...

4
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,529
moving in from the continent.

5
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,282
Mild winds will be
blowing in from the northwest...

6
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,160
clearing out the clouds
by this evening.

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,413
We'll also have
a beautiful full moon tonight.

8
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:44,168
Tomorrow - fair.
Day after tomorrow - fair.

9
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,589
More news in just a minute.

10
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,134
First, a word from today's sponsor.

11
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,291
Jiji, I've decided!
I'm gonna do it tonight!

12
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,752
Mom!

13
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,881
Oh, hi, Miss Dora.
It's gonna be completely clear tonight.

14
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:34,302
I heard the weather forecast.
There's gonna be a big full moon.

15
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,763
Did you borrow your father's radio
without permission again?

16
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,682
It's okay, isn't it?

17
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,143
Happy to see you, Miss Dora.

18
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,270
Mom, my mind's made up. It's tonight.

19
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,981
Weren't you going to
put it off a month?

20
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,650
But the next full moon
might be on a cloudy night.

21
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,195
I want to make sure I leave
on the perfect night.

22
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,697
Kiki, wait!

23
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,621
My, my.
What's this leaving business?

24
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,498
It's one of our old customs.

25
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,710
At 13, a witch leaves home
for a year of training.

26
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,504
Your little baby is 13?

27
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,799
My, my. Time flies so quickly,
doesn't it?

28
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:17,219
I'm afraid so. But nobody
leaves home that young anymore.

29
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,222
I remember perfectly well...

30
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,808
the exact day
you arrived in this town.

31
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,686
A little 13-year-old girl
came down from the sky...

32
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,522
riding a broomstick, her eyes shining.

33
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:33,069
I thought you were a bit full of yourself.

34
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,237
But Kiki still has much to learn.

35
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,657
She hardly knows any of my potions.

36
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,993
After I'm gone,
who will make this medicine?

37
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,912
Sign of the times, I'm afraid.

38
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,039
Everything changes, bit by bit.

39
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:49,919
But I have to say,
nothing works as well for my rheumatism.

40
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:55,383
You're always telling me to hurry!
Now who's the slowpoke?

41
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,596
I think it's better to leave
with decorum and great dignity.

42
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:05,059
If we put it off for a month, and I find
some wonderful boyfriend, then what?

43
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,727
We'll never leave!

44
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,481
I'm worried about this.
Once you've decided, you can't go back.

45
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,732
Of course. I know that.

46
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:13,943
Good. It's there.

47
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,405
I'm so excited!
It's like getting a birthday present!

48
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,786
Dad!

49
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,497
I've decided to go away tonight!

50
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,291
- Tonight?
- Yeah! I just decided!

51
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,295
Well, yes, but what about
our camping trip for this weekend?

52
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,339
Sorry, Dad!

53
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,843
This won't do at all!

54
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,144
Yes. I'll expect you then.
Thanks.

55
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:56,110
Hi, Mom. I wanted to make sure
you knew that Kiki is leaving tonight.

56
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,319
Yes, at midnight.

57
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:06,287
- Not bad.
- I wish it were a different color.

58
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,331
Witches have always worn this color.

59
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,835
Black cat, black clothes.

60
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,671
It's not really important
what color your dress is.

61
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,132
What matters is the heart inside it.

62
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,135
I know that having a good heart
is very important.

63
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,888
I wish I could show you
that my heart is ready.

64
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,223
Just follow that heart
and keep smiling.

65
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,892
Okay.

66
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,438
Be sure to write home
as soon as you've found a place.

67
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,816
Dad, can I please take the radio?

68
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,985
Mom, you said I could have his radio.

69
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,614
- Yea!
- Well, the radio's yours now.

70
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,950
Okay. Now let me have
a look at my little witch.

71
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,002
You look like your mother
when she was young.

72
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,796
Dad...

73
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,799
would you pick me up like you used to?

74
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,217
Well...

75
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,357
How come you never told me
you were growing up so fast?

76
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,652
You can always come home
if things don't work out.

77
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,780
Come back to my old room?
No, thanks.

78
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,118
I hope you find a good town.

79
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,050
I bet it's real tough to find
a town to live in by yourself.

80
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,052
Don't worry. Kiki will be fine.

81
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,055
- What kind of town are you looking for?
- A big town?

82
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,558
Yeah. By the ocean, I hope.

83
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,727
- Wow!
- I'm so jealous of you!

84
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:59,275
But I'm not going for a good time.
I'll be in training at least a year.

85
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,485
Yeah, but they'll have discos,
won't they?

86
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,033
- Kiki, it's almost time.
- Okay!

87
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,078
That's the broom you're leaving on?

88
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,998
Yeah. I just made it. Pretty cute, huh?

89
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:18,586
It's cute, but you can't start
on a broom that's too small. Take mine.

90
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,588
But, Mom, that one's so old.

91
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:25,885
That's why you should have it.
It never loses its way, even in a storm.

92
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,636
Kiki, trust me.

93
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,682
But I worked so hard on it.
Right, Jiji?

94
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,476
Your mother's broom would be better.

95
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,270
You rotten traitor.

96
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:41,775
He's right. You can make yourself
another broom when you get settled down.

97
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,700
Be careful.

98
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,702
- Go get 'em.
- Bye.

99
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:04,632
Go, go, Kiki! Go, go, Kiki!

100
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,479
She still hasn't got the hang of it.

101
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,448
She's well past the lake
and doing just fine.

102
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,493
I'm going to miss the sound
of those little bells.

103
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,585
Which way are we headed?

104
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,963
I think south, to the ocean.

105
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:53,472
Climb up and turn on the radio.
I don't think I can.

106

122
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,440
Good evening!

123
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:28,984
It was.

124
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,862
Newcomer, I suppose.

125
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,364
I must be.
I just left home tonight.

126
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,618
Would you mind
turning off that music?

127
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,162
I prefer to fly without accompaniment.

128
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,377
Is it really hard to get settled
into a place you've never been?

129
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,714
Oh, yes. Lots can go wrong.

130
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,384
But since I'm good at fortune-telling,
I can handle anything.

131
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,719
Fortunes?

132
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,514
In fact, I've started
telling fortunes about love lately.

133
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,683
What's your special skill?

134
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,145
I haven't made up my mind yet.

135
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,524
Uh-huh. Well, I'm nearly finished
with my training period.

136
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,151
It'll be terrific
to go home with confidence.

137
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,571
That's my town down there.

138
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,242
It's not big or terribly interesting,
but I like it.

139
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,828
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.

140
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,705
Goodbye!

141
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:32,005
Disgusting. What a stuck-up cat.

142
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,715
I have to have a special skill.

143
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,223
What was that about good weather?

144
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,026
Don't tell me you are going to...

145
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,498
We'll sleep here
until the storm's gone.

146
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,376
- Won't we get into trouble?
- Not if nobody finds us.

147
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,010
I'm soaked through.

148
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,761
Do you feel anything moving?

149
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,434
This smells great.

150
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,554
Sorry. We didn't mean to fall asleep
in your breakfast.

151
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,818
Jiji, you've gotta come see the ocean.

152
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,611
I don't believe it! It's huge!

153
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,533
- It's only a puddle to me.
- Aw, come on.

154
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,546
That one's giant. Think there
might be other witches there?

155
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,880
How would I know?

156
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,354
Let's go!

157
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,116
You all right back there?

158
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:51,246
Look. A big town floating on the sea.

159
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,736
Just as I hoped.
A clock tower and everything!

160
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,655
What if there are some
witches living here already?

161
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,240
There may not be.

162
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,824
- Am I gonna like it here!
- It's a trifle large for my taste.

163
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,993
Bless my hourglass!
If that ain't a witch!

164
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,080
Good morning!

165
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,541
Are there any other witches
in this town?

166
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,545
No. Can't say I've seen
a single one of 'em lately.

167
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,256
How about that?
Let's settle down right here.

168
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,259
- Thanks, mister! Bye!
- Don't mention it!

169
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,475
- Tell me we're not landing down there.
- Of course we are.

170
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,156
Everybody's looking at us.

171
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,284
I know. Smile and make
a good first impression.

172
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,827
Well, you see, I'm a witch.
My name is Kiki.

173
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,579
This is my black cat Jiji.

174
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,498
We'd be honored
if we could live here.

175
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,881
We'd love to live here.
You have a wonderful bell tower.

176
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,719
We're glad you like it, my dear.

177
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,064
Hey, kid, what were you doing
jumping into the street like that?

178
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,274
You almost caused an accident.

179
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,069
You must be crazy,
zooming around on a broom in public.

180
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,030
I'm a new witch, sir.
We're supposed to fly around.

181
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,908
You're supposed to obey the law
the same as other people.

182
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,868
What's your name and address?

183
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,914
- Are you gonna tell my parents?
- Of course, if it's necessary.

184
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,582
I have to. You're a minor.

185
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,710
Thief! Somebody stop him!
Stop, thief!

186
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,755
Don't you move from there!

187
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,363
Kiki.

188
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,411
Wait up!
It worked out pretty good, huh?

189
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,373
Good plan to get rid of that cop, huh?
I was the one yelling "Thief!"

190
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,749
You're a real witch, right?

191
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,377
I saw you flying.

192
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,754
Could I look at that broom?

193
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,631
Hey, Tombo!

194
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,384
Isn't it a bit early for girl hunting?

195
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,595
Hey, you guys, shut up.

196
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:24,144
Let me look at your broom.
Please? Just for a minute.

197
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,229
I didn't ask for your help.

198
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,607
I guess I have to thank you...

199
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,611
but it was rude for you not to
introduce yourself first.

200
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,625
How old-fashioned.
You sound like my grandma.

201
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,251
Go away and leave me alone!

202
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,430
What a cool witch.

203
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,772
Stay here alone? I don't understand.
Aren't your parents here with you?

204
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:13,068
No. I'm a witch, so since I'm 13, I'm
supposed to be independent.

205
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,362
May I see some identification?

206
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,572
Never mind then.

207
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,882
- Are you going to eat that?
- You can have it.

208
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,513
It's going to be getting dark
fairly soon.

209
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,814
Let's go.

210
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,730
Let's just find another town.

211
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,649
There must be a nicer one.

212
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,659
Lady! Your pacifier!

213
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,328
Lady, you forgot this!

214
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:55,295
When that baby wakes up
and doesn't find this, he's gonna cry.

215
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:05,305
I'm sorry, sir, but could you wait
just a minute? I'll be right back.

216
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,813
- I could bring it down to her.
- What?

217
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,649
The woman with the baby carriage, right?

218
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,694
That'd be a big help.

219
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,947
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

220
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,325
Let's go, Jiji.

221
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,085
Wow!

222
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:49,265
Sorry to startle you, but
you left this pacifier in the bakery.

223
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,660
Here you go.

224
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:09,869
The usual?

225
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,163
Hi! Come on in!

226
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,505
Thank you.

227
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,341
Next!

228
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,969
Thank you. Bye.

229
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,224
Take care.

230
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:39,649
I must say, I nearly fainted
when I saw you fly off.

231
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,527
That woman told me
to give you this message.

232
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,740
" I got the pacifier you sent.

233
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,077
Thank you!"

234
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,288
I guess I should be going.

235
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,205
Wait!

236
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,709
Where are you going so fast?
I want to thank you.

237
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,633
Come up here.

238
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,433
Sit down and relax.
I'll make us some coffee.

239
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,158
- Thank you very much.
- And this is for you.

240
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:36,456
I see. You need to
find your own town.

241
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,628
Yes, but people don't seem
fond of witches in this town.

242
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,839
There are many kinds of people
in a big town like this.

243
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,342
Take me, for instance.
I like you very much.

244
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,138
Found a place to stay yet?

245
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:59,145
You should have told me
you hadn't.

246
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,106
We have a vacant room in the attic
you can stay in.

247
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,358
You'd give me a room?

248
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,070
I'd be happy to.

249
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,656
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Osono.

250
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,158
My name's Kiki.

251
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,160
This is my black cat Jiji.

252
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,969
It's not very clean at the moment,
but it's all yours.

253
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:31,844
Thank you.

254
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,513
Bathroom and water are downstairs.

255
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:37,016
- Don't hesitate to ask for anything.
- Thank you!

256
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,690
There's flour everywhere.

257
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,539
At this rate,
I'll be a white cat by morning.

258
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,087
Jiji, come look at the ocean from here.

259
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,138
Shall we try to find another town?

260
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,734
The Freedom Adventurer has commenced
its maiden voyage to Antarctica.

261
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,236
What a snob.

262
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,631
I've decided to stay awhile.

263
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,759
Maybe I can find others like Osono...

264
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,095
who will like me and accept me
for what I am.

265
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,045
How much do you think a phone
would cost to put in here?

266
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,382
- A phone?
- Yeah. For my business.

267
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:19,405
Good morning, everyone.

268
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,908
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes!

269
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,368
That smells good. Can I help out?

270
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,726
A delivery service, huh?

271
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:54,065
I have one skill - flying - so I thought
a delivery service was a good idea.

272
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,568
Everyone will love it.
Kiki's Flying Delivery Service.

273
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,656
And you can base the business
out of your room upstairs.

274
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:02,782
Really?

275
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,617
Thank you.

276
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,913
- I'd like to put a phone up there.
- But a phone costs money.

277
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,041
- I have some saved up already.
- Don't waste it.

278
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,253
Why not use our phone?

279
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:18,047
It takes time to get regular customers.

280
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:22,510
If you help around the bakery, you won't
have to pay rent or the phone bill.

281
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,054
I need a lot of help
since I'm expecting a baby.

282
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,348
And I'll throw in
free breakfast too.

283
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,767
Thank you!

284
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,644
I'll do my very best for you.

285
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,648
You're such a wonderful person!

286
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,682
Jiji, come on! I'm all done!

287
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:13,686
It's time to go shopping.

288
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,580
Stop jumping out into the street.
We're not at home.

289
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,291
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

290
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:40,129
I've never been more embarrassed
in my whole life.

291
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,964
It was so terrible!

292
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,810
I wish I had something pretty to wear.

293
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,405
Boy, this is expensive.

294
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,574
Kiki, look!

295
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,589
Do you have any money left?

296
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:27,134
We'll just have to eat
pancakes for a while.

297
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,273
Wow! Those are beautiful.

298
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,367
Wait! Pull over a second!

299
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,204
Miss Witch!

300
00:31:58,792 --> 00:31:59,959
Not flying today?

301
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,713
What'd I tell you?
Black is all she wears.

302
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,342
Wait! Come back! I'm sorry!
I was only kidding!

303
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,440
Perfect timing, Kiki.

304
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:26,318
A lady wants you to deliver something.
She's your first customer.

305
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,446
Customer? I'll be right back!

306
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,410
The map!

307
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,299
This lady is a customer of ours.

308
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,968
We were talking about
your delivery service.

309
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,305
- You are a cute little witch.
- My name's Kiki, ma'am.

310
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,267
Could you deliver this by tonight?

311
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,269
Yes!

312
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,439
It's my nephew's birthday.

313
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,233
But I can't get there myself
to give him his present.

314
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,319
Where do you want it delivered?

315
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,531
That's me.

316
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,242
It won't be too far?

317
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,369
I can fly there directly from here.

318
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:21,123
- How much do you want?
- I haven't really set a price yet.

319
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,792
Is this enough?

320
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,217
This is more than enough.
Thank you very much, ma'am.

321
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,660
Oh, wow! That's great!

322
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:01,914
- I wish I could fly.
- Yeah! Hey, do you know that girl?

323
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:23,102
How high do you intend to go?

324
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:27,022
It's my first delivery. I don't want
to be stopped by that police officer.

325
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:32,319
I was afraid you were going to
deliver it to the angels.

326
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,327
It's just beyond the cape.

327
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,039
Here we go!

328
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,633
I'm liking this town more and more.

329
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,427
I'm not sure what I think.

330
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,513
I'll finally be able to write Mom.

331
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,909
Those are wild geese. Wonderful!

332
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,748
They're flying along with us!

333
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,276
- They seem awfully upset.
- They say a wind's coming.

334
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,737
They also say they're going higher.

335
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,171
Oh, no!

336
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,735
I'm sorry. I... Oww!

337
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:44,785
Please! I'm sorry!
I wasn't trying to steal your eggs!

338
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,629
I've never been so scared.

339
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,967
It's your fault. They warned us
of that wind, but you didn't listen.

340
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:00,884
You're right.

341
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:08,559
That's beautiful. They were able
to fly that high up with the wind.

342
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:09,977
Kiki!

343
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,854
The toy is gone!

344
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,731
Oh no!

345
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,691
We've gotta go back to where we fell!

346
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,708
They're saying,
"The egg thief's coming again!"

347
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,585
What are we gonna do?

348
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,186
Hey! Stop that!

349
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,313
Don't do that!

350
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,065
Stop it!

351
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,079
We're in trouble. They're still upset.

352
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,041
Witches get no respect these days.

353
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,585
Crows used to be witches' servants.

354
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,129
That was a long time ago, okay?

355
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,008
How about we go get it after dark?

356
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,178
We'll never make it in time.

357
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,847
There's only one way to do it.

358
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,849
They'll find out I'm a fake.

359
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,144
After I find it,
I'll be right back to help you out.

360
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,776
- Is that the place?
- Yes. Don't move a muscle.

361
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,861
- Can I breathe?
- Hold it as long as you can.

362
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,881
Yea! Give me my present!

363
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,386
That's pretty weird.

364
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,768
A bit late, aren't you?

365
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,229
After my sister telephoned,
we were wondering where you were.

366
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,730
I'm sorry.

367
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:24,736
Could I please have your signature?

368
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,991
Mom, can I put
the canaries in here?

369
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,077
Uh-huh, but be careful
you don't let any of them escape.

370
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,245
Okay.

371
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,250
Thank you very much.

372
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,430
Come on, birdie!

373
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,766
I'm gonna put you
in a bigger house!

374
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,063
Please hurry, Kiki.

375
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,931
I know it was here,
so it's gotta be around someplace.

376
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,363
There it is!

377
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,286
Excuse me! Anybody home?

378
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,122
Can you please help me?
Anybody?

379
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,173
Anybody here?

380
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,259
Yeah! I can't come down right now.

381
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,514
Why don't you come up?

382
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:27,734
What do you want?

383
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,905
That stuffed black cat
you put on your window sill?

384
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,532
I'm sorry, but it's mine.
I dropped it.

385
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,869
Be good, and don't move yet.

386
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,541
I found it in the forest.

387
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,419
Would you give it back
to me, please?

388
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,338
Hang on a minute.
I can't stop just now.

389
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,842
Nice. Very nice.

390
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,469
You're beautiful
just the way you are.

391
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,732
You really should have told me
you were in a hurry.

392
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:13,196
- I got sort of fond of it.
- I'm sorry.

393
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,659
The stuffing's coming out.

394
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:20,412
I'll bet the crows did it.
They made such a fuss.

395
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,415
What am I gonna do?
I can't deliver it like this.

396
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,670
Say!
How about we work out a deal?

397
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,258
That's pretty exciting.
And at 13 too.

398
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,261
To be independent.
That's great.

399
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:39,639
- Can you fix it?
- Trust me.

400
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,316
Ketto, time for your bath.

401
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:56,239
Quickly! The guests
will be here soon!

402
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,701
Ketto!

403
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,555
- I'm done.
- Thank you so much!

404
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,307
You'd better help Jiji
before it's too late.

405
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:08,061
- But I haven't finished yet.
- You've done enough. Go help him.

406
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,021
Thanks!

407
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:23,201
Jeff likes my present
more than me!

408
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,120
It is strange, you know.

409
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:28,498
He adores that stuffed cat.
He won't leave it alone.

410
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,375
He thinks it's a puppy.

411
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:33,003
Your sister's not going to be
happy to hear that.

412
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:38,884
- That's okay. I gave it to Jeff anyway.
- Remember to tell Auntie "thank you".

413
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:44,139
You should be nicer to him.
Jeff is a very old dog.

414
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,975
But, Grandma,
all he does is sleep!

415
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,227
I suppose that's true.

416
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:53,023
Ketto, go open the door.
Jeff wants to go out.

417
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,903
Be sure to push the door shut
when you're finished.

418
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:09,414
- Jiji!
- Kiki, what took you so long?

419
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,916
I'm sorry.

420
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,919
That marvelous dog
helped me escape.

421
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,469
He said he'd be happy
to help us out.

422
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,811
Would you take this back in?

423
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,969
What's the matter?

424
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,471
- I'm famished.
- Yeah, me too.

425
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,014
And I'm tired too.

426
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,141
But it sure was
a wonderful adventure.

427
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,936
And that painter
who found the stuffed cat

428
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:15,188
wants to do a drawing with me in it.

429
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,648
- Naked?
- Don't be silly!

430
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:29,119
"Kiki's Delivery Service"

431
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,120
Boring.

432
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:05,215
Hey! Aren't you supposed to be
minding the shop?

433
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,009
I am,
but nobody's coming in today.

434
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:13,598
- But it always gets busy around now.
- I know, but I mean my customers.

435
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:15,517
Jiji, if nobody comes in

436
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:19,771
I'll have to eat pancakes forever...

437
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,024
and be fat, fat, fat!

438
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,693
So, what am I supposed to do?

439
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,655
I think pancakes are superb,
provided they're not burnt.

440
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:34,160
You're no help.
When you get fat, see if I care.

441
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,295
Beautiful, isn't she? Somebody told me
she's a fashion designer.

442
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,549
Personally, I'm not very fond
of her conceited cat.

443
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,346
Hello. Gutiokipan Bakery.

444
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,807
Pardon? Yes, ma'am.

445
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:58,309
About time we got a customer.

446
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:02,063
4:30 will be a perfect time
to pick it up.

447
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,399
And the address?

448
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:07,569
Yes. The blue roof. Right.

449
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,113
Yes, I'm sure I have it all.

450
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,198
Thank you very much.

451
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:16,077
Hi.

452
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,004
I'll take this one.

453
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,798
Okay?

454
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,014
Thank you very much.

455
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,391
Are you still mad at me?

456
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,810
We're having a party
at the club tonight.

457
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:44,981
It's called the flying club,
and we'd really like you to come.

458
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,192
Here's your invitation.

459
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:52,739
It really is a serious club.

460
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,950
Everybody would be very happy
if you came.

461
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,619
May I help you?

462
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:00,622
They tell me
you have a delivery service.

463
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,458
Oh. Pardon me.
Yes, of course we do.

464
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,377
It's urgent this package arrive tonight.
Can you do it?

465
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,254
Of course we can...

466
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:10,757
Are you gonna be all right?

467
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:12,592
- Uh-huh.
- Can I help you?

468
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:13,801
Uh-uh.

469
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,738
I'll be back at 6:00,
so make up your mind by then.

470
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:35,532
How much will that be?

471
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,201
Will that be inside
or outside the city limits?

472
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,871
- I wrote it down on the box.
- The box? Oh, I'm sorry.

473
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,751
Osono!

474
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,296
I got an invitation to a party
at Tombo's flying club.

475
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,257
Terrific!
You'll have a wonderful time.

476
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,759
But what am I gonna wear?

477
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:59,430
Kiki, I wouldn't worry too much.
You look fine in that.

478
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,516
It makes you look beautiful
and mysterious.

479
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,685
- You mean it?
- Any work yet?

480
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:07,063
I almost forgot about it!
It's already 4:00!

481
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,189
Oh, no!

482
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,901
Can you watch the store
'til I get back?

483
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,112
Jiji! Jiji!

484
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:33,256
Why are you going to this party
when you're so mad at him?

485
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:37,010
I have to concentrate.
This thing is heavy. Be quiet.

486
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,197
Thank you.

487
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,158
Come on!

488
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,248
Our next appointment is at 4:30.

489
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,181
There's the blue roof.

490
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:46,329
My name's Kiki. Someone telephoned
for a delivery service, so here I am.

491
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,790
Right this way, dear.

492
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:58,508
- You're right on time.
- Yes, ma'am.

493
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,931
Madam, the delivery girl is here.

494
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,559
What? Oh, my goodness!

495
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:13,022
Is it that time already?

496
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,108
- Come, come.
- Thanks.

497
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,235
May I take that for you?

498
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,745
Broom and black cat.

499
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:31,040
It's just like my great-grandmother
always told me.

500
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,419
My name is Kiki, and I'm a witch.

501
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:38,798
Oh, and what a cute
little girl you are.

502
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:44,429
I'm so sorry, but that pie you were
supposed to deliver isn't ready yet.

503
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:49,434
The temperature
doesn't seem to go up at all.

504
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,185
Something's wrong.

505
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:57,567
Machines don't work
when they become old like me.

506
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:01,904
I was hoping you could deliver it hot
to my grandchild's birthday party.

507
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:06,743
It's one of my favorite recipes:
herring and pumpkin pie.

508
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,412
I guess I have to admit defeat.

509
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,165
I'll have to phone her
and tell her I'm sorry.

510
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:15,376
I feel just awful
having you come here for nothing.

511
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,669
Bertha!

512
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,884
Would you get her money, please.

513
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,177
Certainly, ma'am.

514
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,138
All of it.
Pay her the amount we agreed on.

515
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,766
- Oh, no. Please!
- Now, don't be silly.

516
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,976
It's not your fault it wasn't ready.

517
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,523
I have no other jobs today.
Maybe I could help.

518
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,317
Does that oven over there work?

519
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,153
You mean that one?

520
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:47,825
It used to be the only one I ever used,
but I haven't opened it in years.

521
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:52,538
If it burns firewood, I can help.
I used to help my mom all the time.

522
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:55,166
It's a big job to build a fire.

523
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:56,793
It's a great idea, madam.

524
00:54:56,919 --> 00:55:00,755
I never did like that electric thing,
and we have plenty of firewood.

525
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,340
I can build a fire.

526
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:06,844
Well, I'm not sure,
but if you think you can build it...

527
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,352
But won't this make you late
for your party?

528
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,437
I can't take money for nothing.

529
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,947
Come on. We have to hurry up.

530
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,535
Look what I found. And it works!

531
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:35,164
You're very good at this, my dear.
Your mother taught you well.

532
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,884
Oh, my goodness, it's so exciting.

533
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,804
Never did like electricity.

534
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,070
It should be about time.

535
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:08,447
Yes, very good. Well done.

536
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,419
And now we wait.

537
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,630
- About 40 minutes or so. Right?
- Exactly right.

538
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,926
- So why don't we take a little break?
- Do you need help with anything else?

539
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:32,930
Oh! Well,
if you'd really like to...

540
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,433
Thanks very much.

541
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,268
You're very welcome.

542
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,356
- You're going to be late for the party.
- Stop worrying.

543
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,568
It'll only take me 15 minutes
if I fly there fast.

544
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,281
Would you care for some tea?
I just made a pot.

545
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,036
I just remembered.
Won't you be late for your party?

546
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:58,289
It won't be a problem.
It'll take me 15 minutes from here.

547
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:03,169
But, my dear, that clock
runs about ten minutes slow.

548
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,964
- What'll I do?
- See if the pie's ready.

549
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,301
Bertha! Bertha!

550
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:23,022
- Is the pie ready?
- It smells fine, so you'd better hurry.

551
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,074
Better hurry! Come on!

552
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,285
- Okay.
- Don't forget your money.

553
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,413
- That's way too much.
- Not for what you've done.

554
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,666
Hurry up, Kiki, or you'll be late!

555
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:45,169
- Have a good time!
- Be careful!

556
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:54,637
What happened
to all that good weather?

557
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,430
My whiskers are tingling.

558
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:24,709
- Could we get out of the rain?
- We can't! That'll only make us later!

559
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:26,711
Besides, the food will get cold
if we stop.

560
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,108
Yes?

561
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,985
I have a delivery.

562
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,737
But it's completely wet.

563
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:39,408
I'm sorry. It began to rain on the way.
But the food came through all right.

564
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:42,912
I told Grandma I didn't want that.

565
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,706
Grandma sent another of
her crummy herring pies!

566
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:50,044
Um, would you please sign
this receipt for me?

567
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:54,131
I hate Grandma's stupid pies.

568
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:02,473
She can't possibly have been
her granddaughter.

569
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,947
Do you think we can still
make it in time?

570
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,472
Look! Tombo's down there!

571
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,724
We can still make it.

572
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:54,191
That certainly was quite an ordeal.

573
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,485
That boy waited a very long time.

574
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:59,655
Doesn't matter anyway.
I can't go in these wet clothes.

575
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,878
Kiki, what's wrong?

576
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,671
Do you have a headache?

577
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:20,551
Why don't we grab a bite to eat?
I know I'm famished.

578
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,538
Kiki!

579
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,436
Not feeling very well, huh?

580
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:19,193
- You have quite a fever.
- Is someone pounding on my head?

581
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:22,279
I'll bet you never dried yourself off
completely yesterday.

582
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,783
Am I gonna shrivel up and die?

583
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:32,623
You have a cold, is all.
I'll bring up some medicine.

584
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:35,167
And you should eat something.

585
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,502
I'm not hungry.

586
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,463
It'll be better if you eat now.

587
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:42,383
How about some oatmeal?
Like some, Jiji?

588
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,349
Oatmeal's the best thing for a cold.

589
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:52,893
There you go.

590
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:56,188
Don't burn your tongue.

591
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:03,237
Come and eat your oatmeal
before it gets cold.

592
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:05,823
Do I have to eat?

593
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:07,241
If you want to get well.

594
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:10,744
That boy was in the shop
a while ago.

595
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:16,500
When I told him you were sick,
he asked how a witch could catch a cold.

596
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,171
Oh, yes. He said he wanted
to visit you a little later.

597
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,548
Oh, no!

598
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:27,261
I figured you might say that,
so I politely refused.

599
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:30,097
You're tired. Just relax and sleep.

600
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,351
I'll just open the window
for some fresh air.

601
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,110
- Osono.
- Hmm?

602
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,613
Um, never mind.

603
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:15,726
Jiji!

604
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,395
Jiji!

605
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:20,564
What?

606
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:50,094
Jiji! Breakfast is ready!

607
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,428
Kiki?

608
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,973
- Feeling better this morning?
- Much better, thank you.

609
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,476
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize I'd overslept.

610
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:01,897
That's okay. Come down here later.
I have a favor to ask of you.

611
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:02,940
Okay.

612
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,275
"Koppori. " Is that right?

613
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,152
Uh-huh. Is this enough money?

614
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,155
That's all right.
It's close enough to walk from here.

615
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,866
Don't be silly. Work is work.

616
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,868
And be sure to deliver it
to him direct.

617
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:19,081
Jiji!

618
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,960
- You have work?
- It's not far away.

619
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,336
Who's your friend?

620
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,339
Lily's her name. I'll be down.

621
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:31,343
Don't worry. I'll be back in a minute.
Pleasure to meet you, Lily.

622
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,268
Wonderful.

623
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,863
Hey! Miss Witch!

624
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:40,746
- Taking a walk?
- I'm looking for someone named Koppori.

625
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,248
Hey, that's my name!

626
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,128
Go around that way.
I'll be right with you.

627
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,884
I'll bet Osono planned this.

628
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,099
Gee, thanks a lot.

629
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,899
I want to apologize
for making you wait the other night.

630
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,402
I'm sorry you got wet.

631
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:16,365
Want to come over to my place?
I have something to show you.

632
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:19,368
Come on! Hurry!

633
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:26,083
That party was to celebrate
the completion of this thing.

634
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,754
This is the engine
of a human-propelled plane.

635
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,589
Like it?

636
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:37,427
We're assembling the wings and the frame
at somebody else's house.

637
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:41,306
I'm planning on flying this thing
during my summer vacation.

638
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:50,190
Hey! Let's go see where
that dirigible suddenly landed!

639
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,984
"Dirigible"?

640
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,069
You didn't see it on TV?

641
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,989
- I was sleeping.
- Then we have to go!

642
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,950
- We're going with this?
- Why not?

643
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:03,328
I have to practice anyway.
Gotta build up my legs.

644
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:05,747
Okay. Ready?

645
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,755
I've never ridden a bicycle before.

646
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,049
Oh, boy! Even better!

647
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:19,803
Brace the bike with your foot
until I get her revved up. Let's go!

648
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:28,478
Kick off!

649
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:40,073
- Should I get off?
- No!

650
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:08,435
Go faster! Go!

651
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:10,520
That's great! Hang in there!

652
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:17,361
Swing your body to the inside
when we go around the curve.

653
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:20,280
Otherwise it won't turn very well.

654
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:23,825
Now!

655
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:28,997
Great! You're doing fine!

656
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:40,467
Yippee! Great!

657
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,562
- The dirigible, right?
- Right.

658
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,240
We're flying!

659
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:32,269
Tombo, are you okay?

660
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:35,439
- Yeah. Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

661
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,587
Does my face look that funny?

662
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:04,426
I'm sorry, but when we flew
over that cliff, I was so scared!

663
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,182
I was scared too.

664
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:13,268
I'll bet you used some magic.

665
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:15,687
I'm not sure. I was so frightened.

666
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:18,315
Your poor bike. It's a mess.

667
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:23,028
Oh, no! Am I in trouble!

668
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:26,615
- Will you look after the bike for me?
- What happened?

669
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,618
I pedaled too hard!

670
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,453
Wait there!

671
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:57,312
Sure would be terrific to go around
the world in a dirigible like that.

672
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:00,315
How'd it make you feel,
the first time you flew?

673
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:03,068
I can't recall.
I was too young to remember.

674
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:06,154
But my mom told me
I wasn't scared a bit.

675
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:10,158
Gosh, I sure wish I was born
into a witch family.

676
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:13,578
You can just fly away
on a broomstick, but me...

677
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,455
That's all I can do.

678
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:20,544
I don't find flying that much fun.
It's more of a job to me.

679
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:24,548
But I think it's wonderful that
you can put your talents to work.

680
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:27,050
I sort of feel
my confidence slipping.

681
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:31,596
But I'm glad I came with you today.
I feel better sitting by the ocean.

682
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:35,559
I could bring you here anytime you want
and train myself at the same time.

683
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,854
- You're a very nice person.
- You just found out?

684
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,981
I used to think
you were kind of a clown.

685
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:43,191
My mom says the same thing.

686
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:47,320
"You clown! Quit looking up to the sky
and get back to your books!"

687
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,578
- Tombo!
- Huh?

688
01:12:57,415 --> 01:13:00,208
- Hey! Guess what!
- What?

689
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:02,335
Something good! Come here!

690
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,170
I'll be right back. Wait here.

691
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:10,343
They said we could go inside.
Coming?

692
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,637
They what? Wow! Of course!

693
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:14,598
Hey, who's your girlfriend?

694
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:18,059
That's Kiki the Witch.
Come on over, Kiki!

695
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:21,730
They're gonna show us around
inside that dirigible!

696
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,064
No, thanks.

697
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,358
Ah, come on. It'll be fun.

698
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:29,112
The delivery girl.
I'm positive that's her.

699
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,324
- You mean she's a working girl?
- My, how independent.

700
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,160
Come on.
I'll introduce you to everybody.

701
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:37,120
No, thanks. See you later.

702
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:38,788
What's the matter?

703
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,045
What are you so mad about?

704
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,713
I'm not mad at all.

705
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:49,382
I have a lot of work to do,
so just leave me alone.

706
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,473
Tombo, let's go!

707
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:36,489
I think something's wrong with me.

708
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:40,160
I make friends, then suddenly
I can't bear to be with any of them.

709
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:42,662
That other me,
the cheerful and honest one...

710
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,164
went away somewhere.

711
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,175
Some friend you are.

712
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:29,167
Jiji, I don't care
if you do have a girlfriend.

713
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,461
You can't be late for every meal.

714
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:33,713
And clean up after yourself.

715
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:37,258
What are you talking like a cat for?

716
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,267
Jiji.

717
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:48,561
Oh, no! Talk to me!

718
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:50,730
You mean you can't speak anymore?

719
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:55,777
Jiji!

720
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:57,946
I wonder what happened to him.

721
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,865
I can't figure out
a word he says anymore.

722
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:02,659
Oh, my gosh!

723
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,518
I'm losing my powers.

724
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:31,247
You can't fly anymore?
Have you lost your magic?

725
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:36,669
It's become very weak, so I think I've
gotta take a break from delivery work.

726
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:41,049
But I'll work really hard in the bakery,
so please let me stay in my room.

727
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:43,593
Of course you can stay.

728
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:45,553
Will your powers come back?

729
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:49,349
I don't know. Maybe.
I can make another broom, but...

730
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:55,939
Look!

731
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:35,979
It's me, Tombo. Did you see me today?
I was waving at you from the dirigible.

732
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,648
The captain took me on the test flight.

733
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,400
It was great!

734
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:43,152
Hello? Kiki, are you there?

735
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:44,654
Please don't call me anymore.

736
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:49,409
What? I can barely hear you.
The captain said he'd like to meet you.

737
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:52,120
Hey, come on! Don't hang up!

738
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,959
What's wrong?
You don't look like you feel well.

739
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:01,254
I'm still training to be a witch.

740
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:05,675
If I lose my magic, that means
I've lost absolutely everything.

741
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,872
Kiki!

742
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:38,333
Hi!

743
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:44,213
You didn't come pay me a visit,
so I had to come visit you.

744
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:48,009
- I'm sorry.
- Well, I also came to shop a little.

745
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:51,262
Come on in. I'm done now.
We can take a break.

746
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:53,389
You'd better believe I will.

747
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:00,021
- Nice place you have.
- Help yourself to these.

748
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:03,399
- I'll make some fresh tea.
- No tea, thanks. Do you have some milk?

749
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:04,400
Sure.

750
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,533
Positively amazing.

751
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:16,329
The spitting image of
that stuffed cat. You're Jiji, right?

752
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:21,209
How's the home delivery business?

753
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:28,758
- That bad, huh?
- I'm not working much now.

754
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:41,270
I thought you seemed down.

755
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:43,856
I didn't know things like that
happened to witches.

756
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:52,740
Why not come and stay
at my place?

757
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:58,454
Tell your boss you need a break.
They'll manage somehow.

758
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,081
How about it, Jiji?

759
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:06,879
Rather be with your girlfriend?

760
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:08,881
Come on! Let's go!

761
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:21,436
Hurry! The bus is leaving!

762
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:14,322
I'm bushed!

763
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:17,325
It's so beautiful here.

764
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:30,713
Must've been blind, with two
beautiful girls in front of him.

765
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,405
What do you mean,
you thought I was a boy?

766
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:58,658
Well, look at the way you're dressed.

767
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:03,037
Tell me what kind of boy
has these legs, mister.

768
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:13,172
- Crows!
- We've become real close friends.

769
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:14,465
Wow.

770
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,760
Hello, everybody. We're home again.

771
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:20,596
Good afternoon.
I'm sorry I bothered you before.

772
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:28,396
Make yourself at home
while I get some water.

773
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:25,661
Like it?

774
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:26,954
Wonderful.

775
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:29,999
I got the idea for it
after we met the first time.

776
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:33,836
But I really haven't got
the girl's face right.

777
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,757
I've been waiting for you to come back.

778
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:39,759
- You mean, that's me?
- Yes.

779
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:42,511
Would you be my model?

780
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:44,764
But I'm not beautiful.

781
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:53,689
You've got a great face. Besides,
it's prettier than it was the last time.

782
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:56,317
Come on. Have a seat. Right there.

783
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:02,406
Lift up your head a little.

784
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:05,826
Look beyond the horizon.
Don't move. Very good.

785
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,538
Painting and magical powers
seem to be very similar.

786
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:14,502
- Sometimes I can't paint a thing.
- You mean it? Then what happens?

787
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:16,379
Kiki, don't look over here.

788
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:22,885
Without even thinking about it
I used to be able to fly.

789
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:26,847
Now I can't even begin to remember
how I ever managed to do it.

790
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,727
At times like that,
you know what I do? Paint.

791
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:33,896
That gets rid of my frustrations.

792
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:38,401
- But still, if I can't fly...
- Then I just stop.

793
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:41,320
Take long walks,
look at the scenery, doze off at noon.

794
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:42,738
Don't do a single thing.

795
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:45,825
Then, suddenly,
I'm able to paint again.

796
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,326
Maybe that'll help.

797
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:50,538
Trust me. It'll happen.
Come on, don't ruin the pose.

798
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:15,938
When I was your age,
I'd already decided to become an artist.

799
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:19,692
I loved painting.
So much that I couldn't sleep.

800
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:22,987
Then one day, for no reason,
I became unable to paint.

801
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,074
So I just kept on painting anyway,
but still it was no good.

802
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:31,328
I realized that I was just
imitating other painters.

803
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,623
Just copies of paintings
I'd seen somewhere.

804
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,293
I swore I'd paint my own pictures.

805
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:39,879
That must've been hard.

806
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:44,967
But after that...
it's not much easier now.

807
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:48,929
I think I found what painting means,
at least for me.

808
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:53,642
To fly, you don't chant
a spell or something, right?

809
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:56,312
Mm. We fly with our spirit.

810
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,982
The witch's spirit? Perfect!
That's what I'm talking about.

811
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:02,818
The spirit of witches.
The spirit of artists.

812
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:04,278
The spirit of bakers!

813
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:08,491
I suppose it must be
a power given by God.

814
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:10,826
Sometimes you suffer for it.

815
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:15,372
I guess I never gave witchcraft
much thought.

816
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:18,834
That talk about discipline and training
was so old-fashioned.

817
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,630
I was so happy that you came
all that way to see me.

818
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:26,467
Left alone, I would've been
one giant ball of frustration.

819
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:32,264
There have been many times I've thought
of painting over that painting.

820
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:34,975
Why? It's so beautiful.

821
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:36,852
When I saw you today...

822
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:39,855
I looked at your sad face
and thought, " I've found it!"

823
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:43,359
- I knew I could paint you.
- Not fair!

824
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:46,487
Sure it is.

825
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:50,157
- Let's go to sleep.
- Okay.

826
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:55,663
- Sorry about taking your bed from you.
- Don't worry about it.

827
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,709
Can I visit you
once in a while?

828
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:05,381
Sure. Anytime during the summer.
And I'll try to visit you too.

829
01:29:11,555 --> 01:29:13,556
The dirigible
Freedom Adventurer...

830
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,391
recently downed
in a spectacular forced landing...

831
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:18,561
due to torrential rains
just outside the city limits...

832
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:20,729
has now been repaired.

833
01:29:21,147 --> 01:29:23,399
Hello. Gutiokipan Bakery.

834
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,484
Ah, Kiki.

835
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:30,197
Take plenty of time
and get rested up.

836
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:33,534
That elderly lady you helped has
another job for you.

837
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:35,494
Should I tell her no?

838
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:39,582
I've told her you'd be away
for some time, but she kept insisting.

839
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:43,586
Then stop on your way back.
Bye.

840
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:05,107
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Well, well.

841
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,234
We've been expecting you.
Come in.

842
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:13,866
There are less than five minutes
to takeoff now.

843
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:18,829
- Very nice to see you again, ma'am.
- I'm glad you came.

844
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:23,918
Excuse me for not standing, but my legs
are bothering me more than usual.

845
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:25,127
Bertha, bring the package.

846
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:26,962
Yes!

847
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,756
I hope it hasn't taken off yet.

848
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:30,132
Not yet.

849
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:33,469
Bertha's absolutely mad
about lighter-than-air travel.

850
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:35,512
I'm the adventuresome type.

851
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:38,766
Turn the volume down.

852
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:42,144
Kiki, would you open the box?

853
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:43,687
Yes.

854
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:52,404
What's this?

855
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:55,532
Would you please deliver it
to a girl named Kiki?

856
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,701
She was kind
and a tremendous help.

857
01:30:58,161 --> 01:30:59,703
It's my "thank you".

858
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:03,707
And would you find out
when her next birthday might be?

859
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:07,127
Then I'll be able
to bake her another one.

860
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:13,425
Kiki.

861
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:20,891
I will. And I'm sure Kiki will
want to know the lady's birthday...

862
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:23,352
so she'll be able
to give her a present.

863
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:25,688
You've got a deal.

864
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:42,371
- What happened?
- There's been a terrible catastrophe.

865
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,541
Oh, no! The ropes holding
the blimp are breaking!

866
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:47,543
It's drifting straight toward
our television cameras.

867
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,420
My God, it's going to...

868
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:56,218
Oh! They always leave me hanging
at the most exciting part!

869
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:59,513
These winds always come
in midsummer.

870
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:01,557
They'll be hitting us
pretty soon.

871
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:07,813
It'll pass by quickly.
Don't worry.

872
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:09,648
Oh, goody, it's back on.

873
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:15,612
It's completely upside-down!

874
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:18,657
The Freedom Adventurer
has been shaken by great winds...

875
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,535
It's like a balloon
in that position.

876
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:25,831
It has broken loose from its mooring and
drifted into an upside-down position.

877
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:29,501
A desperate, last-ditch effort is
being made to tie the dirigible down

878
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:31,670
and keep it from drifting away.

879
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:38,093
It's extremely doubtful whether
it can be done... Oh, no! It's useless!

880
01:32:38,428 --> 01:32:41,180
That's my friend Tombo
holding on to that rope!

881
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:45,768
...attached to the end of the cable
as though it were a toy!

882
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:48,103
There's a young boy
hanging on to the cable!

883
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:51,523
He's being lifted away
along with the police car!

884
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:54,902
I don't believe what I'm seeing!
Oh, the humanity!

885
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:58,238
- Are you sure it's your friend?
- I have to go!

886
01:32:58,364 --> 01:33:00,949
- Be careful!
- Oh, dear. What's happening?

887
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:28,560
Hold on there, son!
Just hold your grip steady!

888
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:30,479
Release the helium from the tail!

889
01:33:57,173 --> 01:34:00,926
All citizens are requested
to remain calm. Do not panic.

890
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:03,804
The helium inside the dirigible
will not explode.

891
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:06,098
Tombo.

892
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:09,059
Any word about the boy
hanging on the rope?

893
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:12,604
The latest report was that
the police car dropped into a pool!

894
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,704
Clear the street!
Get on the sidewalk!

895
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:30,956
Do not block the street!

896
01:34:35,795 --> 01:34:37,421
Are you feeling all right?

897
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,928
Please, sir,
may I borrow your broom?

898
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,931
- Huh?
- I promise I'll bring it right back.

899
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:50,267
- Well, I suppose that's okay.
- Thank you very much!

900
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:28,847
Fly.

901
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:33,143
Oh, my goodness!

902
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:03,298
Straighten up and fly right,
or I'll burn you!

903
01:36:10,807 --> 01:36:12,266
The boy appears safe...

904
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:15,310
but the dirigible is on a collision
course directly for the clock tower.

905
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,229
If the wind doesn't shift direction...

906
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:20,941
the Freedom Adventurer
will surely smash into the tower!

907
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,320
We gotta get up higher!
We're gonna hit the tower!

908
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:27,155
There's not enough helium!

909
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,616
Before we hit, jump onto the tower!

910
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:31,159
Aye, aye, Captain!

911
01:36:31,286 --> 01:36:33,620
Hey there! Over here! Come on!

912
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:36,707
- Get out of the way!
- Grab hold of this!

913
01:36:54,017 --> 01:36:55,225
That way! Hurry!

914
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:57,144
Don't you dare!

915
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:14,369
That sound
is the helium gas leaking.

916
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:17,539
The condition of the boy is unknown.
From where I'm standing... Oh, no!

917
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:25,672
Too much gas has escaped,
and it's falling!

918
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,643
It's snagged on another building!

919
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:41,730
- Hey, look! Over there!
- It's a miracle!

920
01:37:41,898 --> 01:37:43,982
The boy has managed
to keep hold of the rope!

921
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:46,985
But how can anyone rescue him now?

922
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:49,780
That boy is hanging on for dear life.

923
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:51,782
Something just flew by!

924
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:52,866
Is it a bird?

925
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:56,578
No, no, it's a girl!
A witch!

926
01:37:56,913 --> 01:37:59,581
Yes, there is a young girl
soaring through the sky!

927
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:01,583
Wow! Go, Kiki!

928
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:03,085
She can fly now!

929
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:04,336
Get 'em!

930
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:06,421
Tombo!

931
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:08,090
Kiki!

932
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:13,512
Come on!
Be a good broom and help me out!

933
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:16,223
Hang on, young fella! Don't give up!

934
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:19,226
Hold on!
She's almost there!

935
01:38:20,061 --> 01:38:21,311
Tombo!

936
01:38:22,188 --> 01:38:23,271
Kiki!

937
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:30,779
Hold on! Don't give up now!

938
01:38:33,491 --> 01:38:34,741
Don't give up, son.

She caught him in midair!
I've never seen anything so amazing!

They've landed safely.
What a sight to see!

942
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:16,658
Everyone onboard appears to be fine.

943
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:19,202
That broom is mine.
I gave it to her myself.

944
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,622
She did it! She did it!

945
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:25,125
You're so brave, Kiki.

946
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:26,835
You did a great job!

947
01:39:29,338 --> 01:39:32,507
Better call the hospital.
I'll be ready any minute now.

948
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:41,850

01:42:29,352 --> 01:42:33,980
"Dear Mother and Father,
How are you doing? Jiji and I are fine."

957
01:42:34,523 --> 01:42:36,816

There are still times
when I feel sad...

960
01:42:41,364 --> 01:42:43,698
but all in all,
I sure love this town.
