7
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,574
Ease the sail!

8
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,378
It's blowing too hard!

9
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:57,556
Curse it! A storm this time of year?
Where's my Weatherworker?

10
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:03,121
What are you waiting for?
Calm the waves before we sink!

11
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,126
What's wrong?

12
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:10,191
Captain... I can't remember them.

13
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,795
I can't remember the True Names
of wind and waves.

14
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,302
What? Are you mad?

15
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,604
Captain!

16
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,042
There's something above the clouds!

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,910
Where?

18
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,518
What is that?

19
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,344
A dragon!
What is it doing here?

20
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,177
There's another one!

21
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,117
Dragons fighting? That's impossible!

22
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:03,114
More than 2, 000 sheep
have taken the fever in Enlad alone.

23
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,108
Half of them have died.

24
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,818
Seven hundred cattle
have been infected.

25
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,117
We've lost 50 head so far.

26
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:16,985
In fact, a baby on Taon
has also come down with the fever.

27
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,522
Silence!

28
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,133
If we panic,
what will become of the People?

29
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,269
Seal off the affected areas.

30
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:31,639
Send every healer
in the kingdom to find a cure.

31
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,913
Send provisions
to those who need them.

32
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,814
Wizard Root!
Find out what's behind this.

33
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,652
Your Majesty.

34
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,452
And the drought
in the provinces?

35
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,087
We sent Weatherworkers
but the results were disappointing.

36
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,100
Soon it may be too late
for the spring planting.

37
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:00,566
Why have these misfortunes
befallen us, Root?

38
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,608
I sense the Light dimming,
Your Majesty.

39
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,242
The Light?

40
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:09,145
The Light of the Balance
that sustains the world.

41
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,273
Your Majesty!

42
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,815
What now?

43
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,509
Terrible news!

44
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,646
Dragons have been sighted
off the coast!

45
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,655
- Dragons?
- Two, Majesty. One was killed.

46
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:26,856
Dragons here, in the East?
Can this really be true?

47
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,563
Long ago, dragons
and men were one.

48
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:36,671
But men who coveted possessions
chose the land and the sea.

49
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,610
Dragons who wanted freedom,
chose wind and fire.

50
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,848
Since then, dragons and men
remained apart.

51
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:49,283
To hear that dragons have been seen,
and were even fighting...

52
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,524
The twilight that threatens
us is ever deepening.

53
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:01,461
Bring the captain to me.
I would hear more of this.

54
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,670
Root, I want you there too.

55
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,509
Please... Your Majesty!

56
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,737
- We'll get in trouble!
- I have to!

57
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:16,246
- What is it?
- Have you seen Prince Arren?

58
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,509
He's been gone since last night.

59
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,151
Prince Arren? Gone?

60
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,516
That's enough.

61
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,057
His Majesty is occupied.

62
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,593
Surely you can see that.

63
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,100
Forgive me.

64
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,660
It's just... he seems so sad lately.
We were worried.

65
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,667
That's absurd!
Arren is 17, not a child.

66
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,474
Forgive this disturbance, Your Majesty.

67
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,516
Your people are more important.

68
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,176
- Very well, then.
- Your Majesty.

69
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,486
I must tend
to my correspondence.

70
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,924
We await your command, sire.

71
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,202
I'm imagining things.

72
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,130
Arren!

73
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,948
So you are my death...

74
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,257
Are you hurt?

75
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,046
Steady there, lad!

76
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,404
Is this what you seek?

77
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,577
This is dangerous country
for travelers.

78
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,414
You were lucky this time.
You must be hungry.

79
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,448
It's not much,
but you're welcome to it.

80
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,653
What is your name, lad?

81
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,189
My name is Arren.

82
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:11,567
Arren, is it?
It means sword, doesn't it?

83
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,438
So you hail from Enlad.

84
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,611
How did you know?

85
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,439
That blade
was forged with magic.

86
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,450
I doubt you could unsheathe it.

87
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,128
What is it?

88
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,762
It's nothing.

89
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,444
Arren?

90
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,647
If you have nowhere to go,
why not come with me?

91
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,416
I doubt our meeting here
was an accident.

92
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,486
And I'd welcome
a companion on the road.

93
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,797
Arren! Are you coming?

94
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,800
What should I call you?

95
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,310
Call me Sparrowhawk.

96
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,744
Another abandoned farm.
Farmers leaving their land...

97
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,911
There's more to this
than poor harvests.

98
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,749
Come, Arren.
We'd better push on.

99
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,022
Lord Sparrowhawk?

100
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,527
Sparrowhawk will do.
What is it?

101
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,831
Sparrowhawk?

102
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,031
Where are we heading?

103
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:03,037
First. we go to the next town.
But after that...

104
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,376
...even I don't know.

105
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,427
- Getting tired?
- No.

106
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,465
Come along.
We're almost there.

107
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,452
There it is.

108
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,256
Hort Town.

109
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,823
Are they prisoners?

110
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,560
They are slaves.

111
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,326
Here, people are goods
to buy and sell.

112
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,698
Trading in human lives!

113
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,101
Two guineas, gentlemen!
Do I hear two guineas?

114
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,901
I have two guineas!

115
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:20,035
Three! Sold to the gentleman
for three guineas!

116
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:32,186
No, sorry!
Couldn't possibly find room!

117
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,209
Gauzes from Sowl!
Silks from Lorbanery!

118
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,576
Furs and felts and woolens!

119
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,807
Is this a market day?

120
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,078
No. It's like this year round.

121
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,583
Silks and satins!
Canvass and fleecefells!

122
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,753
What can I show you?

123
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,125
This is Lorbanery's finest silk!

124
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,557
Fine as a mayfly's wing!

125
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:18,570
I don't have a wife.
I need a cloak for my friend.

126
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,601
Wizards! No girlfriend, eh?

127
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:27,703
- But I don't need a cloak.
- You can't go about like that.

128
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,808
You should hide
that thing on your belt.

129
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,110
What about this?

130
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,248
Fleece from Gont.
Highest quality.

131
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:40,257
Four warp strings.
This is Andradean work.

132
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,558
On Gont they use six or more.

133
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:49,262
You used to be a sorceress.
Why are you selling fakes?

134
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,070
People don't believe
in foolish tricks any more.

135
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:56,071
My goods are
not what I claim.

136
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,269
But at least they're real...

137
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:03,075
...not mere lies and air
like magic and sorcery!

138
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,180
Sparrowhawk!

139
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,355
Thank you!

140
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,615
What!

141
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:50,486
Unhand me!

142
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,892
Calm yourself, young master.

143
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:00,070
I have something for you.
It's the door to bliss.

144
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,571
What is it?

145
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,068
Hazia, my lord. Ha-zi-a.

146
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,577
Take one.
Leave sorrow and fear behind.

147
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,014
No more sorrow or fear...

148
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:15,576
You'll never be troubled
with the pain of this world again.

149
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:19,412
You needn't pay me.
It's my pleasure.

150
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,424
Arren.

151
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,763
What are you doing?

152
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,560
Is this your friend, my lord?

153
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:34,572
And what about you?
Don't wizards have troubles too?

154
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:39,075
I'm sorry. I have no use
for what you're selling.

155
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,707
Save us from the arrogance
of sorcerers!

156
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,345
I suppose you've lost
your powers too!

157
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:53,857
Hazia is not something
to toy with, Arren. Look!

158
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:58,153
The hazia eater feels
himself in paradise.

159
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:03,462
Then the spirit leaves the body
and wanders aimlessly in darkness.

160
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:08,596
When it returns? More hazia.
And finally, death.

161
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,876
What's the matter?

162
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,654
Feeling better?

163
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,797
The wind is fresh up here.

164
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,896
Something's wrong with this town.

165
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,835
Not only this town, lad.

166
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:44,666
Farmers' crops wither.
Their sheep and cattle are falling sick.

167
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,836
Even people's minds
have lost their way.

168
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,342
Is it some sort of pestilence?

169
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:56,347
No. A pestilence
is how the Balance restores itself.

170
00:20:56,622 --> 00:21:00,353
But this? I fear someone
is trying to destroy the Balance.

171
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:05,254
There's only one creature
in Earthsea capable of such evil.

172
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,828
Only one.

173
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,769
Well then.
Shall we go back to the inn?

174
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,204
I'd like to rest a little longer.

175
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,906
Very well.

176
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,403
I'll be waiting.
Keep your wits about you.

177
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,304
I will.

178
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,928
Slave takers?

179
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,780
A witch, are you?

180
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,113
And an ugly one at that!

181
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,650
Won't fetch much with that face.

182
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:19,062
Just a few guineas.
But we can still have a little fun.

183
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,163
Oww! My finger!

184
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,402
The witch has spirit!

185
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,395
I'm going to enjoy this.

186
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,803
Who's there?

187
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,299
Step forward and show yourself!

188
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,149
Well, well.

189
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,720
What are you
doing here, boy?

190
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,719
Go ahead. Take him!

191
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,391
No hard feelings, boy.
Just following the boss's orders.

192
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,096
I'll make it quick.

193
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,428
Or maybe you'd like to be a slave?

194
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,264
Beg for your life!

195
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,439
Changed your mind?

196
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,682
Life is nothing to me.

197
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,452
So you want a fight, eh?

198
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,487
Draw your sword!

199
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,003
All right. Now it's my turn.

200
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,555
Uh oh.

201
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:01,731
Hold on there son.
You don't care about the girl?

202
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,061
Do it.

203
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,499
If you want her so much,
here she is!

204
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,710
Come on men!
Let's go!

205
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,445
Are you...

206
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,124
Therru!

207
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,261
Therru!

208
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,541
Therru...

209
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:57,678
A bird...

210
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,834
So! We meet again, boy.

211
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,632
Take him!

212
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:29,745
He'll fetch a good price.
Don't be too rough.

213
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,350
Take him away!

214
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:43,888
Just an old piece of junk.
Couldn't give it away!

215
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,530
Give it up, it's no use.

216
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:30,573
Quiet!

217
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:34,270
Silence!
Or I'll feed you to the hounds!

218
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:04,940
Come on!

219
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,800
Get moving!

220
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,311
What's going on?

221
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:13,009
I don't know.
Move, you lazy animals!

222
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,484
Confound it! What's wrong?

223
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,480
Sparrowhawk...

224
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,482
Let's go, Arren.

225
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,988
Can you stand?

226
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,605
What about the others?

227
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,407
I left none bound.
Now it's up to them.

228
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,458
How did you know
where to find me?

229
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:41,204
When you didn't come,
I scoured Hort Town.

230
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:45,942
Finally, someone told me
a young man was taken by slavers.

231
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:50,206
I had to make
a spell of finding.

232
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,710
I am sorry, I was foolish.

233
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,988
No, it was my fault.

234
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,852
I should've been more careful.

235
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,955
I'm sorry.

236
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:08,355
Who's there?

237
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,757
It's me, Sparrowhawk.

238
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,295
Sparrowhawk?

239
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,228
Someone's been hurt.

240
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,831
I'm sorry. It's late.

241
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,841
It's been a long time, Ged.

242
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,322
He's asleep.

243
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,561
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid you've lost your bed.

244
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,931
It's his now.
Here, this will warm you.

245
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,057
Thanks.

246
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,701
You haven't changed.

247
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,846
No.
You're keeping well, Tenar?

248
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,817
I suppose.
It hasn't always been easy.

249
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,850
And you?

250
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,188
Do you still wander?

251
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,349
That was good.

252
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,789
It has been a long time.

253
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,156
Yes, it has.

254
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,898
As Archmage, I have no time...

255
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,792
...to wander as I once did.

256
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:30,098
And what brings the Archmage
so far from home?

257
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,946
Evil tidings come
from every corner of Earthsea.

258
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,374
Things are out of balance...

259
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:43,119
...as if the sun's light
were ebbing.

260
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:47,118
Is the Art Magic ebbing too?

261
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:52,629
Yes. As if our very blood
were flowing from our veins.

262
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,296
So you search for the answer?

263
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,558
Yes.

264
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,405
Oh dear, we woke you up.

265
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:09,412
Come, child. Don't worry.
This man is an old friend of mine.

266
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,580
This is Therru.
She's been with me five years.

267
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,387
Call me Sparrowhawk.
I'm sorry I woke you.

268
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:27,628
Hawk?

269
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:37,500
Well, you should be honored.
Therru never speaks to strangers.

270
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:38,939
What is it?

271
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,946
Could she really be...?

272
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,073
Lord Cob.

273
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,337
Enter.

274
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,810
Forgive my intrusion.
I beg leave to speak.

275
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:57,846
What is it?

276
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:00,924
I'm afraid some
of our slaves escaped.

277
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:05,929
I see. You let
my precious merchandise go.

278
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,630
No. We've captured most of them.

279
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:10,928
And?

280
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,929
What about the others?

281
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,942
We're scouring the countryside.
We'll find them.

282
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,076
You're a fool.

283
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:27,009
Do you think
I can't manage without you?

284
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:36,520
It was a wizard!
A wizard with a scar on his face!

285
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:38,220
What?

286
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,523
A scar on his face?

287
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:47,437
It's Sparrowhawk.
The Archmage pays me a visit.

288
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:51,268
Find him for me,
Hare... or else.

289
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,966
I won't fail you, my lord.

290
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:04,312
I've waited long
for this day... Sparrowhawk.

291
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:43,017
Tenar! I brought the water in!

292
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,623
Where is she?

293
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,357
Tenar? Are you still asleep?

294
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:49,866
Tenar?

295
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:52,558
Are you sick?

296
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,274
Who was that?

297
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,147
It's that girl!

298
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:12,311
That must've been a surprise.
I'm sorry dear. I should've told you.

299
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:15,856
Don't worry. Arren is with me.

300
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,819
You have nothing to fear.

301
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:21,829
Sometimes his eyes are wild,
but he has a good heart.

302
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:27,567
Good morning.

303
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:30,571
Good morning.

304
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,904
I'm done eating!

305
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,376
Well!

306
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:39,345
Did you sleep well?
How do you feel?

307
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,716
I'm all right.

308
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,579
I didn't do anything to her.

309
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,823
Of course you didn't.
Come have breakfast.

310
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,256
Can't work if you don't eat.

311
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,097
Work?

312
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,222
Ouch...

313
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,796
Are you getting blisters?

314
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,065
Yes.

315
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,794
Shall we rest a bit?

316
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,570
What a good smell.

317
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,576
- But...
- Yes, lad?

318
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,809
You're a wizard, aren't you?

319
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,412
Oh, I see.

320
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:54,390
You want to know why a wizard
toils in the field like a farmer?

321
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,459
Yes.

322
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,058
Listen, Arren.

323
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:02,963
Everything under the sun
and stars depends on the Balance.

324
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:08,465
The wind and seas.
The power of earth and light.

325
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:15,273
All that these do is well
and rightly done within the Equilibrium.

326
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,615
But now, men hold
the power to control the world.

327
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:24,048
So Man must learn
to keep the Balance...

328
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:28,990
...and do what leaf and whale
and wind do of their own nature.

329
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,890
You know everything
has its True Name.

330
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:38,965
Magic is the power to command,
if you know a thing's True Name.

331
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:44,036
Use that power in ignorance
and the Balance is easily damaged.

332
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:47,304
Spells should be made
only of necessity.

333
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,138
You've been busy.

334
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:53,014
I suppose you two
deserve some lunch.

335
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,121
Are you feeling better, Arren?

336
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:02,815
Now eat hearty,
or you won't get your strength back.

337
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,252
What about the girl?

338
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,660
Oh, Therru?

339
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,598
One of the spring lambs is sick.

340
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,060
She's nursing it today.

341
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,868
Shall we change places?

342
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,704
No, I can manage.

343
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,090
- How did it go?
- That's it for today.

344
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,686
Dinner will be ready soon.
Better wash up.

345
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,296
- I'll put the ox in the stable.
- Thanks, lad.

346
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:02,182
There, you should be feeling better.
Now you need your mother's milk.

347
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,690
That's it.

348
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,695
Good girl.

349
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,138
What do you want?

350
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,772
Oh... nothing.

351
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,676
Why did you come here?

352
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:31,145
To hurt me?
To kill this little one?

353
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:34,106
You don't understand!
I was just...

354
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,947
Stay away! Get out of here!

355
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,959
I hate anyone who doesn't value life!

356
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,021
I'm sorry.

357
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,629
Step aside!

358
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,774
Let's eat.

359
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,945
It's so good having men
to help with the farm.

360
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,049
Even you two.

361
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:14,147
I'm no good with a plow,
but I do know animals.

362
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:17,523
You used to be a goatherd.

363
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,794
What's wrong, Arren?
Aren't you hungry?

364
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:26,628
No.

365
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,474
What is this place?

366
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,033
Come, Arren. This way.

367
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:32,397
Sparrowhawk?

368
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:45,672
Come. Take my hand.

369
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,121
Arren!

370
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,814
No! Leave me alone! Stop!

371
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,663
Arren!

372
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,975
Arren! Wake up!

373
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:15,571
Arren!

374
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:23,644
What's wrong?

375
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,288
A bad dream, I think.

376
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:27,917
A dream...

377
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:42,334
Spring is very short, you know.
I need all the help I can get.

378
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:46,837
I'm sorry, Tenar.
I have an errand that cannot wait.

379
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,837
I still can't rely on you.

380
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,039
Come now, Tenar.

381
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,845
Should you be taking Arren's horse?

382
00:45:56,453 --> 00:46:00,981
He's better off without it.
Tell him I borrowed it.

383
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:05,360
Tenar. Keep a close eye
on him for me.

384
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:08,362
I promise.

385
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:11,998
I'll be back tonight!
And back at work tomorrow!

386
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:14,927
I certainly hope so.

387
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,150
Haven't seen him around here.

388
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:40,355
And that scar!

389
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,989
He must've come
from that woman's house.

390
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,695
She's a witch.
I don't like the looks of it.

391
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:52,140
Yes, she's an odd one.
And that little girl she keeps!

392
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,004
That child will bring
bad luck on us all.

393
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:59,276
No! Don't say that out loud!

394
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,519
Who was that?

395
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:07,715
He's not from around here.

396
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,656
He's a friend of ours.

397
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,551
He's helping us out.

398
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,254
Is that so?

399
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:14,955
Can I help you?

400
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:19,660
My child has a fever ma'am.
I need that potion again.

401
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,998
All right. Just wait there.

402
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,302
Quit sticking to me!

403
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,208
I'm afraid!

404
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:33,674
Spare us from evil!

405
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,411
That's enough!

406
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:40,046
There. If the child's not better,
come see me again.

407
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,919
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

408
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,060
Actually, I was wondering...

409
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:49,197
Yes, I know.
Pay me when you can.

410
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:52,095
Thanks ma'am. You're very kind.

411
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:56,396
Hope she feels better!

412
00:47:56,506 --> 00:48:00,203
I wish there were more
decent people in the world.

413
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,870
Therru never hurt anyone.

414
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:08,080
Well, at least the woman
looks after her own.

415
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:14,714
As for Therru, her parents
abused and abandoned her.

416
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:19,592
They burned her.
That's how she got that scar.

417
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,996
What a frightful child!

418
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,631
My goodness!
Did you see her eyes?

419
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,848
Please, have mercy!

420
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,647
No one will buy
an old woman!

421
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:22,791
Nothing to fear ladies.
Maybe you can even help me.

422
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,959
Seen any strangers around here?
Be much obliged for any help.

423
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,726
And I'll pay.

424
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,264
There's one at Tenar's farm!

425
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:37,135
And one with a scar
on his face!

426
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,203
Tenar? Who's that?

427
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,005
The witch! She lives
right up this road.

428
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,804
Thanks for the help, old hags!

429
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,951
Wait! Where are you going?

430
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:55,757
Stop! Liar!
You promised to pay!

431
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,658
There it is! That's it!

432
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:09,863
What's that?

433
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,470
What are you doing?

434
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:23,777
You're looking fit, boy.
Didn't think I'd find you here.

435
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,550
Swine!
What are you doing here?

436
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:31,717
Now, now. I'm not here to fight.
Where's your wizard friend?

437
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:35,229
He's gone!
Sparrowhawk's not here.

438
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:38,466
You'd better not be hiding him.

439
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,696
Why should I?

440
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:43,471
You're no match for him.

441
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:49,041
Looks like she's telling the truth.
All right, we'll be back!

442
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,605
Till then!

443
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,819
Never come back, you swine!

444
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,820
Lord Cob will reward me for this!

445
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:20,508
So that's what happened.

446
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:23,544
Neither of you
said a word about it.

447
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:28,450
I think we fixed most of it.

448
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:29,780
Let's rebuild the fence.

449
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:37,819
Tenar? Have you known
Sparrowhawk for a long time?

450
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,227
Yes, I guess I have.
A long, long time.

451
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,760
He's always been a wanderer.

452
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:51,668
It's the life he chose.
He does it because he has to.

453
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:56,735
And finally he became Archmage,
the greatest of all wizards.

454
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,816
Head of the Great House of Roke?

455
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:03,682
Yes. But years before that,
he rescued me.

456
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,687
Rescued me, and
led me into the light.

457
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:18,064
One man, all alone.

458
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:24,497
He brought me out
of the Tombs of Atuan.

459
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,190
Welcome.

460
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:49,088
Don't get many wizards.
Looking for a weapon?

461
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,190
Show me that sword.

462
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,538
Can't recommend this one.

463
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:00,235
Very unusual workmanship,
so I bought it.

464
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,676
But it's rusted solid.
Can't be drawn.

465
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,649
You there, wizard!

466
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,054
Are you deaf?
I'm talking to you!

467
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,792
You said something, sir?

468
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,535
Is there something
stuck to my face?

469
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,633
Wrong wizard!

470
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:32,834
You! If you see a wizard
with a scar on his face...

471
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:35,969
...tell him Lord Cob
wants to see him!

472
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:40,747
Cob? Never heard that name
back where I come from.

473
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,179
You will, when he's Lord
of the Two Lands!

474
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:46,687
Don't forget it!

475
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,390
Yes sir.

476
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,254
I'll take the sword.
How much?

477
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,761
Wait a minute... your face!

478
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,266
What's wrong?

479
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,427
Nothing... I suppose.

480
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:04,006
Have you heard of
this wizard named Cob?

481
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:07,141
Careful! Keep your voice down.

482
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:12,612
Only wizard in these parts
who still has his powers.

483
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:16,482
Can't say he's loved
by people around here.

484
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,989
He lives in the fortress outside town.
Best keep away from there.

485
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:28,294
I never thought
I'd find you here, Cob.

486
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:40,238
You're good at farm work.
You hardly seem a beginner.

487
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,311
Thank you.

488
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:46,246
Won't you stay on
for a while and help?

489
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,408
Therru would like that too.

490
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:49,348
But...

491
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:53,252
You don't have to decide now.
Think about it, all right?

492
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:54,482
All right.

493
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,192
Stable the ox for me.

494
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,522
Yes, Tenar.

495
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:03,960
I'm home!

496
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:08,636
Therru? Now where is she?
