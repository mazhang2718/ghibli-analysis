1
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,495
Sometimes, I think I"\'"m cursed.

2
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,457
Because of something that happened before I was even born.

3
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:18,502
See, a long time ago, there was this family.

4
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:21,710
The papa, he was a musician.

5
00:01:22,723 --> 00:01:26,341
He and his family would sing and dance and count their blessings.

6
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:29,531
But he also had a dream.

7
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:31,386
To play for the world.

8
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:40,362
And one day, he left with his guitar and never returned.

9
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,406
And the mamé...

10
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,333
She didn"\'"t have time to cry over that walk—away musician.

11
00:01:55,922 --> 00:02:00,666
After banishing all music from her life she found a way...

12
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:02,254
to provide for her daughter.

13
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:09,599
She rolled up her sleeves and she learned to make shoes.

14
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:20,277
She could have made candy, or ﬁreworks, or sparkly unden/vear...

15
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:25,407
for wrestlers, but no, she chose shoes.

16
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:30,282
Then she taught her daughter to make shoes.

17
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,207
And later, she taught her son—in—law.

18
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:37,452
Then her grandkids got roped in.

19
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:41,794
As her family grew, so did the business.

20
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:46,132
Music had torn her family apart.

21
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:49,260
But shoes held them all together.

22
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:55,137
You see, that woman was my great- great—grandmother, Mamé Imelda.

23
00:02:56,483 --> 00:02:58,769
She died way before I was born.

24
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,813
But my family still tells her story every year on Dia de los Muertos...

25
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,321
the Day of the Dead.

26
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,489
And her little girl, she"\'"s my great—grandmother, Mamé Coco.

27
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:11,949
Hola, Mama’ Coco.

28
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:14,660
How are you, Julio?

29
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:16,992
Actually, my name is Miguel.

30
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,747
Mama Coco has trouble remembering things.

31
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,910
But it"\'"s good to talk to her anyway.

32
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,906
So, I tell her pretty much everything.

33
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:27,169
I used to run like this.

34
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:29,211
But now I run like this which is way faster.

35
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:32,675
And the winner is Luchadora Coco!

36
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:36,098
I have a dimple on this side, but not on this side.

37
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,111
Dimple, no dimple.

38
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:38,043
Dimple, no dimple.

39
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,266
Miguel, eat your food.

40
00:03:40,444 --> 00:03:42,810
My abuelita, she"\'"s Mama Coco"\'"s daughter.

41
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:44,474
Oh, you"\'"re a twig, mijo.

42
00:03:44,494 --> 00:03:45,970
Have some more.

43
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:47,147
No, gracias.

44
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:51,655
I asked if you would like more tamalesl Si?

45
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,162
That"\'"s what I thought you said!

46
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:57,624
Abuelita runs our house just like Mama Imelda did.

47
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:01,627
No music!

48
00:04:03,216 --> 00:04:04,331
No music!

49
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:07,626
-Y aunque la vida -No music!

50
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:11,259
I think we"\'"re the only family in México who hates music.

51
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,382
And my family"\'"s ﬁne with that.

52
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:14,799
But me...

53
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:17,060
-Be back by lunch, mijo. —Love you, Mama.

54
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:20,730
I am not like the rest of my family!

55
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:22,661
-Hola, Miguel!

56
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:23,389
-Hola!

57
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:30,480
-Muchas gracias.

58
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,561
-De nada, Miguel.

59
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,235
Hey!

60
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:37,980
Dante!

61
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:40,420
Sit.

62
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,347
Down.

63
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:42,274
Roll over.

64
00:04:42,294 --> 00:04:43,201
Shake.

65
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:45,167
Fist bump!

66
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:47,207
Good boy, Dante!

67
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:53,672
I know I"\'"m not supposed to love music.

68
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,507
But it"\'"s not my fault!

69
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:57,174
It"\'"s his!

70
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,636
Ernesto de la Cruz.

71
00:04:59,656 --> 00:05:01,928
The greatest musician of all time.

72
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:07,603
Right here in this very plaza, Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps...

73
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:11,148
toward becoming the most beloved singer in Mexican history.

74
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,778
He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me.

75
00:05:17,123 --> 00:05:20,957
But when he played music, he made people fall in love with him.

76
00:05:21,878 --> 00:05:23,618
He starred in movies.

77
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:26,118
He had the coolest guitar!

78
00:05:26,138 --> 00:05:27,949
He could ﬂy!

79
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,842
And he wrote the best songs.

80
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:32,794
But my all—time favorite, it"\'"s...

81
00:05:33,390 --> 00:06:07,496
-Remember me -Remember me Though I have to say goodbye -Remember me -Remember me Don"\'"t let it make you cry For even if I"\'"m far away I hold you in my heart I sing a secret song to you Each night we are apart Remember me Though I have to travel far -Remember me -Remember me Each time you hear a sad guitar Know that I"\'"m with you the only way that I can be Until you"\'"re in my arms again He lived the kind of life you dream about.

82
00:06:12,095 --> 00:06:13,676
Until 1942.

83
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:18,719
When he was crushed by a giant bell.

84
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:22,098
I want to be just like him.

85
00:06:28,278 --> 00:06:33,944
Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and I get this feeling like we"\'"re connected.

86
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:39,365
Like if he could play music, maybe someday, I could too.

87
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:42,204
If it wasn"\'"t for my family.

88
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:43,490
-Ay-ay-ay, muchacho.

89
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,656
-Huh?

90
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:46,952
I asked for a shoe shine not your life story.

91
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,825
Oh, yeah.

92
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:48,530
Sorry.

93
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:50,786
I just can"\'"t really talk about any of this at home.

94
00:06:50,806 --> 00:06:52,367
So...

95
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:55,544
If I were you, I"\'"d march right up to my family and say...

96
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:56,878
"Hey, I"\'"m a musician.

97
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:58,044
Deal with it."

98
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:01,591
—I could never say that. —You are a musician, no?

99
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:03,798
I don"\'"t know.

100
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:05,544
I mean, I only really play for myself.

101
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:10,563
Did de la Cruz become the world"\'"s best musician by hiding his skills’?

102
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:13,207
No!

103
00:07:13,227 --> 00:07:15,687
He walked out onto that plaza and he played out loud.

104
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:17,653
Mira, mira, they"\'"re setting up for tonight!

105
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:20,615
The music competition for Dla de Muertos.

106
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:21,983
You want to be like your hero?

107
00:07:22,003 --> 00:07:23,229
You should sign up!

108
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:24,527
Uh—uh.

109
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:25,648
My family would freak!

110
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:29,710
Look, if you"\'"re too scared then, well, have fun making shoes.

111
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,331
Come on, what did de la Cruz always say?

112
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:35,417
Seize your moment?

113
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,674
Show me what you got, muchacho.

114
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:41,847
I"\'"ll be your first audience.

115
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:50,105
Miguel!

116
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:53,605
-Abuelita! —What are you doing here?

117
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:57,731
You leave my grandson alone.

118
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:58,835
Doﬁa, please!

119
00:07:58,855 --> 00:07:59,813
Iwasjust getting a shine.

120
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:01,459
I know your tricks, mariachi.

121
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:03,017
What did he say to you?

122
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:04,659
He was just showing me his guitar.

123
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:05,909
Shame on you.

124
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:11,788
My grandson is a sweet little angelito querido cielito.

125
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,456
He wants no part of your music, mariachi.

126
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:15,873
You keep away from him.

127
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,171
Ay, pobrecito.

128
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:22,963
Oh, estas bien, mijo.

129
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,386
You know better than to be here in this place!

130
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,096
You will come home.

131
00:08:29,116 --> 00:08:30,638
Now.

132
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,193
How many times have we told you?

133
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:44,985
That plaza is crawling with mariachis.

134
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:46,491
Yes, Tio Berto.

135
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:48,636
-No, no, no, no, no! —Go away, you.

136
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:50,115
Go!

137
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:51,455
It"\'"s just Dante.

138
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,299
Never name a street dog.

139
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:54,979
They"\'"ll follow you forever.

140
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:56,659
Now, go get my shoe.

141
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:05,594
I found your son in Mariachi Plaza.

142
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:06,925
AM Miguel!

143
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,136
You know how Abuelita feels about the plaza.

144
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:10,657
-I was just shining shoes.

145
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:12,010
-A musician"\'"s shoes!

146
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:16,185
But the plaza"\'"s where all the foot traffic is.

147
00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:19,980
If Abuelita says no more plaza, then no more plaza.

148
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:22,198
-But what about tonight? —What"\'"s tonight?

149
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,588
Well, they"\'"re having this talent show.

150
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:26,818
And Ithought I might...

151
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:29,948
—Sign up? —well, maybe?

152
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:33,250
You have to have talent to be in a talent show.

153
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:34,681
What are you gonna do?

154
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:36,034
Shine shoes?

155
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:37,793
It"\'"s Dla de los Muertos.

156
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:39,455
No one"\'"s going anywhere.

157
00:09:39,475 --> 00:09:41,036
Tonight is about family.

158
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:42,854
Ofrenda room.

159
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:43,997
Va’monos.

160
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:56,520
Don"\'"t give me that look.

161
00:09:56,694 --> 00:10:01,362
Dia de los Muertos is the one night of the year our ancestors can come visit us.

162
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:05,526
We"\'"ve put their photos on the ofrenda so their spirits can cross over.

163
00:10:05,703 --> 00:10:07,489
That is very important.

164
00:10:07,622 --> 00:10:10,409
If we don"\'"t put them up, they can"\'"t come.

165
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:14,826
We made all this food, set out the things they loved in life, mijo.

166
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:18,087
All this work to bring the family together.

167
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:20,789
I don"\'"t want you sneaking off to who knows where.

168
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:23,372
Where are you going?

169
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:24,506
I thought we were done.

170
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:26,959
Ay, Dios mio.

171
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:29,331
Being part of this family means being here for this family.

172
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:31,296
-I don"\'"t want to see you end up Iike--

173
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:33,167
-Like Mama’ Coco"\'"s papa’?

174
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:34,822
Never mention that man!

175
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,340
He"\'"s better off forgotten.

176
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:38,140
But you"\'"re the one who—— I was just—— But--

177
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,848
I--

178
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:41,556
Papa?

179
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:43,264
Papa is home?

180
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:46,199
Mama’, calmese, calmese.

181
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:47,696
Papa’ is coming home?

182
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:48,888
No, Mama.

183
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:49,999
It"\'"s okay.

184
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,110
I"\'"m here.

185
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:53,873
Who are you?

186
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:56,621
Rest, Mama.

187
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,202
I"\'"m hard on you because I care, Miguel.

188
00:10:59,222 --> 00:11:00,867
Miguel?

189
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:02,532
Miguel?

190
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:07,803
What are we going to do with that boy?

191
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,153
You"\'"re right.

192
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:12,757
That"\'"s just what he needs.

193
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,022
It"\'"s you.

194
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:38,801
Get in here.

195
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:39,580
Come on, Dante.

196
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,359
Hurry up!

197
00:11:41,976 --> 00:11:43,600
You"\'"re gonna get me in trouble, boy.

198
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,244
Someone could hear me.

199
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:52,014
I wish someone wanted to hear me.

200
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,355
Other than you.

201
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,284
Ew.

202
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:56,213
Okay.

203
00:11:58,691 --> 00:11:59,806
Perfecto!

204
00:12:33,444 --> 00:12:34,482
I have to sing.

205
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:35,540
I have to play!

206
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:40,476
The music, it"\'"s not just in me, it is me.

207
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:45,355
When life gets me down, I play my guitar.

208
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:51,400
The rest of the world may follow the rules, but I must follow my heart.

209
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:56,405
You know that feeling like there"\'"s a song in the air and...

210
00:12:56,582 --> 00:12:57,913
it"\'"s playing just for you?

211
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:05,004
A feeling so close...

212
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:18,385
you could reach out and touch it I never knew I could want something so much, but it"\'"s true You must have faith, sister.

213
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:20,887
Oh, but, Padre, he will never listen.

214
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:21,886
He will listen.

215
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:22,717
To music.

216
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:36,278
Only a song, only a song has the power to change a heart Never underestimate the power of music.

217
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:44,119
But my father, he will never give his permission.

218
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:45,912
I am done asking permission.

219
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,877
When you see your moment, you mustn"\'"t let it pass you by.

220
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:50,792
You must seize it!

221
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:54,887
Seﬁor de la Cruz, what did it take for you to seize your moment?

222
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:59,108
I had to have faith in my dream.

223
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:01,417
No one was going to hand it to me.

224
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:03,771
It was up to me to reach for that dream.

225
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:05,614
—Grab it tight and make it come true.

226
00:14:05,634 --> 00:14:07,297
-...and make it come true.

227
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,748
No more hiding, Dante.

228
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:15,431
I got to seize my moment!

229
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:19,866
I"\'"m gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if it kills me.

230
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:26,248
Dia de los Muertos has begun!

231
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,494
No, no.

232
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:30,075
We have to make a clear path.

233
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,456
The petals guide our ancestors home.

234
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:34,663
We don"\'"t want their spirits to get lost.

235
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:38,840
We want them to come and enjoy all the food and drinks on the ofrenda.

236
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:41,589
Mama!

237
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:42,835
Where should we put this table?

238
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:44,512
In the courtyard, mr"\'"jos.

239
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,719
-You want it down by the kitchen?

240
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:46,758
-SI.

241
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:47,797
Next to the other one.

242
00:14:50,832 --> 00:14:51,809
—Get under!

243
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:52,806
Get under!

244
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:53,803
-Miguel?

245
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,931
Nothing!

246
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:57,922
Mama, Papa.

247
00:14:57,942 --> 00:14:59,913
I--

248
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,904
Miguel, your abuelita had the most wonderful idea.

249
00:15:02,343 --> 00:15:04,217
We"\'"ve all decided.

250
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,111
It"\'"s time you joined us in the workshop!

251
00:15:06,212 --> 00:15:07,292
What?

252
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,711
No more shining shoes.

253
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:11,631
You"\'"ll be making them every day after school.

254
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:14,517
Oh!

255
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:17,327
Our MigueIi—ti—ti—ti—to carrying on the family tradition.

256
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,943
And on Dia de los Muertos!

257
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:22,423
Your ancestors will be so proud.

258
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:26,146
You"\'"ll craft huaraches just like your Tia Victoria.

259
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:28,894
And wingtips like your Papa Julio.

260
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:31,400
But what if I"\'"m no good at making shoes?

261
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,269
Ah, Miguel.

262
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:35,061
You have your family here to guide you.

263
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,857
You are a Rivera.

264
00:15:37,877 --> 00:15:40,024
And a Rivera is...

265
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,401
A shoemaker.

266
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:43,732
Through and through.

267
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:45,298
That"\'"s my boy!

268
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:46,731
Berto!

269
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,280
Break out the good stuff.

270
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,651
I want to make a toast.

271
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:00,866
Dante!

272
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:01,977
No, Dante.

273
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:03,088
Stop!

274
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:15,373
No, no, no, no, no!

275
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:16,977
No.

276
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:31,122
De la Cruz"\'"s guitar?

277
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:32,868
Papa ?

278
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:34,449
Papa?

279
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:39,589
Mama Coco, is your papa Ernesto de la Cruz?

280
00:16:39,774 --> 00:16:40,937
Papa!

281
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:42,120
Papa!

282
00:16:53,871 --> 00:16:54,503
Papa!

283
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:55,155
Papa!

284
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:55,807
It"\'"s him!

285
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,903
I know who my great—great—grandfather was.

286
00:16:58,032 --> 00:16:59,647
Miguel, get down from there.

287
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:02,696
Mama Coco"\'"s father was Ernesto de la Cruz!

288
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:04,632
—What are you talking about?

289
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:06,487
-I"\'"m gonna be a musician!

290
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,905
What is all this?

291
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:11,736
You keep secrets from your own family?

292
00:17:11,837 --> 00:17:13,668
It"\'"s all that time he spends in the plaza.

293
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:16,623
—Fills his head with crazy fantasies. —It"\'"s not a fantasy.

294
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:18,708
That man was Ernesto de la Cruz!

295
00:17:18,728 --> 00:17:20,625
The greatest musician of all time!

296
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:22,507
We"\'"ve never known anything about this man!

297
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:25,886
But whoever he was, he still abandoned his family.

298
00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:27,633
This is no future for my son.

299
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:30,310
But, Papa, you said my family would guide me.

300
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:32,810
Well, de la Cruz is my family.

301
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,356
I"\'"m supposed to play music.

302
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:35,848
Never!

303
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,221
That man"\'"s music was a curse.

304
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:38,594
Iwill not allow it.

305
00:17:38,698 --> 00:17:40,359
—If you would just |et—— -Miguel...

306
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:41,876
You will listen to your family.

307
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:43,229
No more music.

308
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:46,532
—Just listen to me play! —End of argument.

309
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,487
You want to end up like that man?

310
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:50,693
Forgotten?

311
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:53,208
Left off your family"\'"s ofrenda?

312
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:55,870
I don"\'"t care if I"\'"m on some stupid ofrenda.

313
00:17:59,186 --> 00:17:59,621
-No!

314
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:00,076
-Mama!

315
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,283
There.

316
00:18:06,303 --> 00:18:07,352
No guitar.

317
00:18:07,372 --> 00:18:08,421
No music.

318
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,634
Oh, come.

319
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:16,131
You"\'"ll feel better after you eat with your family.

320
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:18,191
I don"\'"t want to be in this family!

321
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:19,684
Miguel!

322
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:20,474
Miguel!

323
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,228
I want to play in the plaza, like de la Cruz.

324
00:18:41,248 --> 00:18:43,208
Can I still sign up?

325
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:44,422
You got an instrument?

326
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:45,916
No.

327
00:18:45,936 --> 00:18:47,287
But if I can borrow a guitar...

328
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:49,094
Musicians got to bring their own instruments.

329
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:50,682
You find a guitar, kid, I"\'"ll put you on the list.

330
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,853
-Can I borrow your guitar? —Sorry, muchacho.

331
00:18:57,953 --> 00:18:59,139
-You guys have a spare guitar?

332
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:00,345
-No.

333
00:19:01,072 --> 00:19:04,610
—I need a guitarjust for a little bit. —Get out of here, kid.

334
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:21,794
Great—great—grandfather, what am I supposed to do?

335
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,452
No, no, no, no.

336
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:02,658
Dante, stop!

337
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:03,864
Callatel Sh!

338
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:26,771
I"\'"m sorry.

339
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:05,831
Senor de la Cruz, please don"\'"t be mad.

340
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:08,437
I"\'"m Miguel.

341
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:10,978
Your great-great grandson.

342
00:21:10,998 --> 00:21:13,225
I need to borrow this.

343
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,656
Our family thinks music is a curse.

344
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:22,247
None of them understand but I know you would have.

345
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:24,558
You would have told me to follow my heart.

346
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:26,538
To seize my moment!

347
00:21:28,062 --> 00:21:30,773
So, if it"\'"s all right with you, I"\'"m gonna play in the plaza.

348
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:33,504
Just like you did!

349
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:43,199
The guitar!

350
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,217
It"\'"s gone!

351
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:46,433
Somebody stole de la Cruz"\'"s guitar!

352
00:21:46,956 --> 00:21:47,681
The window"\'"s broken.

353
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:48,426
Look!

354
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:54,908
All right, who"\'"s in there?

355
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,331
I"\'"m sorry.

356
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:59,635
It"\'"s not what it looks like.

357
00:21:59,655 --> 00:22:01,939
De la Cruz is my—- There"\'"s nobody here.

358
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:18,108
-Miguel!

359
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:18,750
-Mama!

360
00:22:18,862 --> 00:22:21,322
Miguel, come home.

361
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:23,802
Where are you, Miguel?

362
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:27,674
Dios mio!

363
00:22:27,694 --> 00:22:28,623
Little boy.

364
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:29,572
Are you okay?

365
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:30,521
Here.

366
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:31,470
Let me help you.

367
00:22:33,002 --> 00:22:36,400
Thanks.

368
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,818
I--

369
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:43,236
Do you mind?

370
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:46,654
Whoa!

371
00:23:07,568 --> 00:23:10,310
Look how big she"\'"s getting.

372
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:14,980
Dante!

373
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:16,941
You can see me?

374
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:18,358
Wait!

375
00:23:18,378 --> 00:23:19,775
What"\'"s going on?

376
00:23:19,795 --> 00:23:21,192
Dante!

377
00:23:23,177 --> 00:23:24,010
Oh, I"\'"m sorry.

378
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,863
I"\'"m sorry.

379
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:25,624
Miguel?

380
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:26,657
-Miguel?

381
00:23:26,677 --> 00:23:27,613
-Miguel?

382
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:32,162
You"\'"re here?

383
00:23:32,182 --> 00:23:33,326
Here, here.

384
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:34,490
And you can see us?

385
00:23:34,678 --> 00:23:37,135
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to!

386
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:38,712
Remind me how I know you.

387
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:40,714
We"\'"re your family, mr"\'"jo.

388
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:43,863
-Tia Rosita?

389
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:45,091
-Si.

390
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:49,556
-Papa Julio?

391
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:51,723
-Hola, Tr’a Victoria?

392
00:23:51,904 --> 00:23:54,190
He doesn"\'"t seem entirely dead.

393
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,072
He"\'"s not quite alive either.

394
00:23:57,252 --> 00:23:58,540
We need Mama Imelda.

395
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,848
She"\'"ll know how to fix this.

396
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:01,796
Oye!

397
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:03,565
It"\'"s Mama Imelda.

398
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,372
She couldn"\'"t cross over.

399
00:24:05,469 --> 00:24:06,677
-She"\'"s stuck!

400
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:07,905
-On the other side!

401
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:09,301
Tio Oscar?

402
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:10,484
Tio Felipe?

403
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,136
Oh.

404
00:24:11,156 --> 00:24:11,693
Hey, Miguel.

405
00:24:12,424 --> 00:24:15,006
I have a feeling this has something to do with you.

406
00:24:15,094 --> 00:24:17,130
But if Mama’ Imelda can"\'"t come to us...

407
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:18,354
Then we are going to her.

408
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:19,497
Vamonos!

409
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:36,225
Come on, Miguel.

410
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:37,346
It"\'"s okay.

411
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:52,033
Dante?

412
00:24:52,053 --> 00:24:53,447
Dante!

413
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:54,861
Dante, wait up!

414
00:24:57,312 --> 00:24:59,624
You got to stay with me, boy.

415
00:24:59,644 --> 00:25:01,956
We don"\'"t know... where...

416
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,274
This isn"\'"t a dream then.

417
00:25:24,294 --> 00:25:25,980
You"\'"re all really out there.

418
00:25:26,175 --> 00:25:26,986
-You thought we weren"\'"t?

419
00:25:27,006 --> 00:25:27,817
-Well, I don"\'"t know.

420
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:31,621
I thought it might"\'"ve been one of those made up things that adults tell kids.

421
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,744
-Like vitamins.

422
00:25:33,764 --> 00:25:35,411
-Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.

423
00:25:35,507 --> 00:25:37,088
Well, now I"\'"m thinking maybe they could be.

424
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,028
Mija, it"\'"s not nice to stare at--

425
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:40,056
Ay!

426
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:41,084
Santa Maria!

427
00:25:49,198 --> 00:25:50,561
Are those...

428
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:51,944
Alebrijes!

429
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:53,327
But those are--

430
00:25:53,347 --> 00:25:54,710
Real alebrijes.

431
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,093
Spirit creatures.

432
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:57,856
They guide souls on theirjourney.

433
00:25:57,998 --> 00:25:58,831
Watch your step.

434
00:25:58,851 --> 00:25:59,684
They make caquitas everywhere.

435
00:26:00,324 --> 00:26:02,360
Welcome back to the Land of the Dead.

436
00:26:02,534 --> 00:26:05,196
Please have all offerings ready for re—entry.

437
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,401
Welcome back.

438
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:07,442
Anything to declare?

439
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:08,318
Some churros.

440
00:26:08,338 --> 00:26:09,023
From my family.

441
00:26:09,218 --> 00:26:10,113
How wonderful.

442
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:11,028
Next.

443
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,543
If you are experiencing travel issues, agents at the Department of Family...

444
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:17,204
Reunions are available to assist you.

445
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:18,376
Next family, please.

446
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:23,655
Oh!

447
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:24,933
Your photos are on your son"\'"s ofrenda.

448
00:26:24,953 --> 00:26:26,211
Have a great visit.

449
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:27,130
Gracias.

450
00:26:27,277 --> 00:26:28,815
And remember to return before sunrise.

451
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:30,373
Enjoy your visit.

452
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:32,468
Next.

453
00:26:32,488 --> 00:26:34,425
Your photo"\'"s on your dentist"\'"s ofrenda.

454
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:36,382
Enjoy your visit.

455
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:37,265
-Gracias.

456
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:38,055
-Next?

457
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:41,241
Yes!

458
00:26:41,261 --> 00:26:41,920
It is I.

459
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,599
Frida Kahlo.

460
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:44,447
Shall we skip the scanner?

461
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:47,909
I"\'"m on so many ofrendas it"\'"ll just ovenrvhelm your blinky thingy.

462
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:54,166
Well, shoot, looks like no one put up your photo, Frida.

463
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:58,545
Okay, when I said Iwas Frida, just now, that was a lie.

464
00:26:58,715 --> 00:26:59,921
And I apologize for doing that.

465
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,917
No photo on an ofrenda, no crossing the bridge.

466
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,684
I"\'"m just gonna zip right over.

467
00:27:04,704 --> 00:27:06,367
You won"\'"t even know I"\'"m gone.

468
00:27:08,141 --> 00:27:09,051
Hey!

469
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:17,198
A|most...there.

470
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,007
Just a little further.

471
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:25,345
Ulosy-daisy_._ Fine.

472
00:27:25,365 --> 00:27:26,626
Okay.

473
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:27,907
Fine, who cares?

474
00:27:27,927 --> 00:27:29,188
Dumb flower bridge!

475
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,317
Aw.

476
00:27:31,337 --> 00:27:33,273
I don"\'"t know what I"\'"d do if no one put up my photo.

477
00:27:33,468 --> 00:27:33,968
-Next?

478
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:34,488
-Oh!

479
00:27:34,508 --> 00:27:35,008
Come, mr"\'"jo.

480
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:35,528
It"\'"s ourturn.

481
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:37,240
Welcome back, amigos.

482
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,696
Anything to declare?

483
00:27:38,797 --> 00:27:41,254
As a matter of fact, yes.

484
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:42,956
Hola.

485
00:27:50,777 --> 00:27:53,089
Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos.

486
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:55,421
Please report to Level Seven.

487
00:28:05,073 --> 00:28:06,734
I miss my nose.

488
00:28:16,178 --> 00:28:17,950
Come on, help us out, amigo.

489
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,742
We got to get to a dozen ofrendas tonight.

490
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:23,330
We are not visiting your ex-wife"\'"s family for Dia de Muertos!

491
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:26,215
I demand to speak to the person in charge!

492
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:29,010
I"\'"m sorry, seﬁora, it says here no one put up your photo.

493
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:33,515
My family always puts my photo on the ofrenda.

494
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:36,643
That devil box tells you nothing but lies!

495
00:28:36,823 --> 00:28:39,905
-Mama Imelda?

496
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:43,007
-Oh, mi familial They wouldn"\'"t let me cross the bridge.

497
00:28:43,195 --> 00:28:48,155
Tell this woman and her devil box that my photo is on the ofrenda.

498
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:51,488
Well, we never made it to the ofrenda.

499
00:28:51,672 --> 00:28:52,567
-What?

500
00:28:52,587 --> 00:28:53,482
-We ran into...

501
00:28:58,553 --> 00:28:59,801
-Miguel?

502
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,069
-Mama Imelda.

503
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:03,707
What is going on?

504
00:29:03,882 --> 00:29:05,543
You the Rivera family?

505
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:09,084
-Well, you"\'"re cursed.

506
00:29:09,104 --> 00:29:10,375
-What?

507
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,396
Dla de los Muertos is the night to give to the dead.

508
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:14,330
You stole from the dead!

509
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,632
-But I wasn"\'"t stealing the guitar.

510
00:29:15,652 --> 00:29:16,798
-Guitar?

511
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:18,614
It was my great-great-grandfather"\'"s.

512
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:20,343
He would have wanted me to have it.

513
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,597
We do not speak of that musician.

514
00:29:22,617 --> 00:29:24,764
He is dead to this family.

515
00:29:24,861 --> 00:29:26,852
You"\'"re all dead.

516
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:29,164
I am sorry.

517
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,432
Whose alebrije is that?

518
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:31,649
That"\'"s just Dante.

519
00:29:31,743 --> 00:29:33,779
He sure doesn"\'"t look like an alebrije.

520
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,406
He just looks like a plain old dog.

521
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:37,495
Or a sausage someone dropped in a barbershop.

522
00:29:37,582 --> 00:29:41,325
Whatever he is, I am terribly allergic.

523
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,160
But Dante doesn"\'"t have any hair.

524
00:29:43,255 --> 00:29:45,621
And I don"\'"t have a nose, and yet, here we are.

525
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:50,838
But none of this explains why I couldn"\'"t cross over.

526
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:51,918
Oh!

527
00:29:53,932 --> 00:29:56,548
You took my photo off the ofrenda?

528
00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:57,714
-It was an accident!

529
00:29:57,734 --> 00:29:58,795
-How do we send him back?

530
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:01,473
Well, since it"\'"s a family matter...

531
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:05,774
the way to undo a family curse is to get your family"\'"s blessing.

532
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:06,475
That"\'"s it?

533
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:10,695
Get your family"\'"s blessing and everything should go back to normal.

534
00:30:10,782 --> 00:30:12,522
But you got to do it by sunrise.

535
00:30:12,617 --> 00:30:14,357
What happens at sunrise?

536
00:30:14,494 --> 00:30:16,450
Hijolel Your hand!

537
00:30:21,835 --> 00:30:24,451
Whoa, Miguel, can"\'"t have you fainting on us.

538
00:30:25,098 --> 00:30:26,424
But not to worry.

539
00:30:26,444 --> 00:30:27,770
Your family"\'"s here.

540
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,116
You can get your blessing right now.

541
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:30,929
Cempasuchil, cempasuchil.

542
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:32,567
Aha!

543
00:30:32,587 --> 00:30:34,205
Perdon, seriora.

544
00:30:35,682 --> 00:30:37,968
Now, you look at the living and say his name.

545
00:30:39,102 --> 00:30:39,932
Miguel.

546
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,677
Nailed it.

547
00:30:41,697 --> 00:30:43,344
Now say, "I give you my blessing."

548
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,647
I give you my blessing.

549
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:50,777
I give you my blessing to go home...

550
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:56,241
to put my photo back on the ofrenda, and to never play music again.

551
00:30:56,338 --> 00:30:57,421
What?

552
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:58,524
She can"\'"t do that!

553
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:01,455
Well, technically, she can add any condition she wants.

554
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:04,760
-Fine.

555
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,404
-Then you hand the petal to Miguel.

556
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:19,722
No skeletons!

557
00:31:24,356 --> 00:31:26,472
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.

558
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:32,898
Two seconds and you already break your promise.

559
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:33,991
This isn"\'"t fair.

560
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:35,003
It"\'"s my life.

561
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:36,015
You already had yours.

562
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:38,818
Papa Julio, I ask for your blessing.

563
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:40,669
Tia Rosita?

564
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:41,852
Oscar?

565
00:31:42,175 --> 00:31:43,446
Felipe?

566
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:44,737
Tia Victoria?

567
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:46,846
Don"\'"t make this hard, mr"\'"jo.

568
00:31:46,866 --> 00:31:48,826
You go home my way or no way.

569
00:31:48,922 --> 00:31:50,958
You really hate music that much?

570
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:53,665
I will not let you go down the same path he did.

571
00:31:58,775 --> 00:31:59,773
The same path he did.

572
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:00,791
He"\'"s family.

573
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,315
-Listen to your Mama Imelda.

574
00:32:02,335 --> 00:32:03,748
-She"\'"s just looking out for you.

575
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:04,843
Be reasonable.

576
00:32:04,948 --> 00:32:07,408
Con permiso, I need to visit the restroom.

577
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:09,888
Be right back.

578
00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:14,186
Should we tell him there are no restrooms in the Land of the Dead?

579
00:32:27,627 --> 00:32:28,662
Vamonos.

580
00:32:28,753 --> 00:32:31,210
We got a family looking for a living boy.

581
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:33,789
If I want to be a musician, I need a musician"\'"s blessing.

582
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:35,832
We got to find my great-great-grandpa.

583
00:32:35,927 --> 00:32:37,258
Hold it, muchacho.

584
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:42,712
I found that living boy!

585
00:32:42,732 --> 00:32:43,960
Oh, whoa, excuse me.

586
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,208
Excuse me, folks.

587
00:32:45,353 --> 00:32:46,388
Excuse me.

588
00:32:52,621 --> 00:32:53,391
No, no.

589
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:54,181
Dante!

590
00:32:54,915 --> 00:32:56,465
Disturbing the peace.

591
00:32:56,485 --> 00:32:58,035
Fleeing an officer.

592
00:32:58,055 --> 00:32:59,605
Falsifying a unibrow.

593
00:32:59,794 --> 00:33:00,855
-That"\'"s illegal?

594
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:01,936
-Very illegal.

595
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,111
You need to clean up your act, amigo.

596
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:06,885
Amigo?

597
00:33:06,905 --> 00:33:09,491
Oh, that"\'"s so nice to hear you say that because I have just had a...

598
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:13,787
really hard Dla de Muertos and I could really use an amigo right now.

599
00:33:13,965 --> 00:33:16,377
And amigos, they help their amigos.

600
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:20,468
You get me across that bridge tonight, and I"\'"ll make it worth your while.

601
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:21,501
Oh!

602
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:22,415
You like de la Cruz?

603
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:23,329
He and I go way back.

604
00:33:23,475 --> 00:33:27,138
I can get you front row seats to his Sunrise Spectacular show.

605
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,216
I"\'"ll get you backstage.

606
00:33:28,236 --> 00:33:29,172
You can meet him.

607
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:30,929
You just got to let me cross that bridge!

608
00:33:31,107 --> 00:33:33,143
I should lock you up for the rest of the holiday.

609
00:33:33,568 --> 00:33:37,356
But my shift"\'"s almost up and I want to visit my living family.

610
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:39,654
So I"\'"m letting you off with a warning.

611
00:33:41,044 --> 00:33:42,895
-Can I at least get my costume back?

612
00:33:42,915 --> 00:33:44,766
-No.

613
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,821
Some amigo.

614
00:33:49,886 --> 00:33:51,019
Hey!

615
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,172
Hey!

616
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:53,325
You really know de la Cruz?

617
00:33:53,515 --> 00:33:54,272
Who wants to--

618
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:55,049
Ay!

619
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:55,826
You"\'"re alive!

620
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:57,218
Sh!

621
00:33:57,238 --> 00:33:58,397
Yeah, I"\'"m alive.

622
00:33:58,417 --> 00:33:59,576
And if I want to get back to the Land of the Living...

623
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:01,129
I need de la Cruz"\'"s blessing.

624
00:34:01,304 --> 00:34:02,635
That"\'"s weirdly specific.

625
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:04,546
He"\'"s my great—great—grandfather.

626
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:05,649
He"\'"s your Gr--

627
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:06,667
What?

628
00:34:09,406 --> 00:34:10,632
Wait, wait, wait.

629
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:11,878
Wait, wait.

630
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,823
Wait.

631
00:34:14,843 --> 00:34:16,006
No, wait, wait, wait.

632
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:17,515
Wait!

633
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:18,846
Yes!

634
00:34:18,866 --> 00:34:20,177
You"\'"re going back to the Land of the Living!

635
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,188
You know what?

636
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,063
Maybe this isn"\'"t such a good--

637
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:22,938
No, no, nir”ro!

638
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:23,813
Niﬁo, niﬁo, I can help you.

639
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:24,688
You can help me.

640
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,315
We can help each other.

641
00:34:26,335 --> 00:34:27,771
But most importantly, you can help me.

642
00:34:27,882 --> 00:34:28,669
-Miguel!

643
00:34:28,689 --> 00:34:29,476
-I"\'"m Hector.

644
00:34:29,624 --> 00:34:30,488
That"\'"s nice.

645
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:37,082
Espérame, chamaco!

646
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:47,003
Ay, he is going to get himself killed.

647
00:34:47,023 --> 00:34:48,751
I need my spirit guide...

648
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:50,499
Pepita.

649
00:35:03,116 --> 00:35:05,027
Who has that petal Miguel touched?

650
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:06,562
Here.

651
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:07,933
Nice alebrije.

652
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:22,050
Ay, ay, hold still.

653
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,185
Look up.

654
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,320
A ver, a ver.

655
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,455
Look up, up, up.

656
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:29,483
Aqui arriba, eso...

657
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,878
Eh, la rayita.

658
00:35:32,072 --> 00:35:32,841
Okay.

659
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:33,630
Hey!

660
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,419
Ta-da!

661
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,805
Dead as a doorknob.

662
00:35:38,151 --> 00:35:41,109
So listen, Miguel, this place runs on memories.

663
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:44,271
When you"\'"re well remembered, people put up your photo and you get to...

664
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:46,373
cross the bridge and visit the living on Dia de Muertos.

665
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:48,307
Unless you"\'"re me.

666
00:35:48,495 --> 00:35:50,076
You don"\'"t get to cross over?

667
00:35:50,256 --> 00:35:51,589
No one"\'"s ever put up my picture.

668
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:52,942
But you can change that!

669
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,206
This is you?

670
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:56,658
Eh, muy guapo, eh?

671
00:35:56,836 --> 00:35:59,794
So, you get me to my great-great-grandpa. ..

672
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:02,671
then I put up your photo when I get home?

673
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:03,748
Such a smart boy!

674
00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:04,664
Yes!

675
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:05,580
Great idea, yes!

676
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,496
One hiccup.

677
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:10,171
Dela Cruz is a tough guy to get to and I need to cross the bridge soon.

678
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,733
Like, tonight.

679
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,126
So, you got any other family here, you know?

680
00:36:13,311 --> 00:36:15,393
Someone a bit more accessible?

681
00:36:15,532 --> 00:36:16,382
Mm...

682
00:36:16,402 --> 00:36:17,252
Nope.

683
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,742
Don"\'"t yank my chain, chamaco.

684
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:20,095
You got to have some other family.

685
00:36:20,203 --> 00:36:21,889
Only de la Cruz.

686
00:36:21,909 --> 00:36:23,595
Ifyou can"\'"t help me, I"\'"ll find him myself.

687
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:25,603
Oh!

688
00:36:25,623 --> 00:36:26,268
Okay.

689
00:36:26,288 --> 00:36:26,933
Okay, kid.

690
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:27,598
Fine!

691
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:28,263
Fine!

692
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:28,928
I"\'"ll get you to your great-great-grandpa.

693
00:36:30,964 --> 00:36:32,472
It"\'"s not gonna be easy, you know?

694
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:34,000
He"\'"s a busy man.

695
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,528
What are you doing?

696
00:36:35,718 --> 00:36:36,926
I"\'"m walking like a skeleton.

697
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:38,154
Blending in.

698
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:39,094
No.

699
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:39,862
Skeletons don"\'"t walk like that.

700
00:36:40,056 --> 00:36:41,189
-It"\'"s how you walk.

701
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:42,342
-No, Idon"\'"t!

702
00:36:42,362 --> 00:36:43,495
Stop it!

703
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:45,830
Whoa!

704
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,495
Ernesto de la Cruz"\'"s Sunrise Spectacular?

705
00:36:47,515 --> 00:36:49,160
Qué padre!

706
00:36:49,806 --> 00:36:52,843
Every year your great-great-grandpa puts on that dumb show...

707
00:36:53,017 --> 00:36:54,348
to mark the end of Dia de Muertos.

708
00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:56,100
And you can get us in!

709
00:36:57,355 --> 00:36:59,266
Hey, you said you have front row tickets!

710
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:00,740
That...was a lie.

711
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,133
I apologize for that.

712
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:03,306
Cool off, chamaco.

713
00:37:03,326 --> 00:37:04,053
Come on.

714
00:37:04,073 --> 00:37:04,800
I"\'"ll get you to him.

715
00:37:04,988 --> 00:37:05,693
How?

716
00:37:05,864 --> 00:37:07,695
Because I happen to know where he"\'"s rehearsing.

717
00:37:18,585 --> 00:37:26,001
Remember me Don"\'"t let it make you cry You better have my dress, Héctor.

718
00:37:26,176 --> 00:37:27,256
Hola, Ceci.

719
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:35,670
-Hola.

720
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,917
-Ceci, I lost the dress.

721
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:39,097
Ya Io sabia!

722
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,562
I got to dress forty dancers by sunrise.

723
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:45,066
Thanks to you, I"\'"m one Frida short of an opening number!

724
00:37:45,622 --> 00:37:47,457
Dante!

725
00:37:47,477 --> 00:37:49,312
We shouldn"\'"t be in here.

726
00:38:04,557 --> 00:38:05,555
No, no, Dante!

727
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:06,573
Ven aca!

728
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:16,441
You!

729
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,459
How did you get in here?

730
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,938
-I just followed my--

731
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:20,326
-Oh!

732
00:38:20,346 --> 00:38:21,714
The mighty Xolo dog!

733
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,742
Guider of wandering spirits.

734
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:27,638
And whose spirit have you guided to me?

735
00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:30,111
I don"\'"t think he"\'"s a spirit guide.

736
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:34,028
The alebrijes of this world can take many forms.

737
00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:37,076
They are as mysterious as they are powerful.

738
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:44,697
Or maybe he"\'"s just a dog.

739
00:38:44,717 --> 00:38:46,443
Come, I need your eyes.

740
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:49,873
You are the audience.

741
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:51,665
Darkness.

742
00:38:52,303 --> 00:38:56,171
And from the darkness, a giant papaya.

743
00:38:57,517 --> 00:39:03,638
Dancers emerge from the papaya, and the dancers are all me.

744
00:39:04,566 --> 00:39:08,309
And they go to drink from the milk of their mother, who is a cactus.

745
00:39:08,538 --> 00:39:11,351
But who is also me.

746
00:39:11,371 --> 00:39:14,184
And her milk is not milk but tears.

747
00:39:15,535 --> 00:39:16,615
Is it too obvious?

748
00:39:16,744 --> 00:39:20,157
I think it"\'"s just the right amount of obvious?

749
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:21,925
It could use some music.

750
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:23,529
Oh, what if you did like...

751
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:27,826
Oh!

752
00:39:27,846 --> 00:39:28,491
And then it could go...

753
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,176
And what if everything was on fire?

754
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:37,684
Yes!

755
00:39:37,704 --> 00:39:38,363
Fire!

756
00:39:38,383 --> 00:39:39,042
Everywhere!

757
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:41,381
Inspired!

758
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:43,463
You have the spirit of an artist.

759
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,759
The dancers exit.

760
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:48,130
The music fades, the lights go out.

761
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:51,526
And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage!

762
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:56,652
Huh?

763
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,146
He does a couple of songs, the sun rises, everyone cheers--

764
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:01,518
Excuse me, where"\'"s the real de la Cruz?

765
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:03,697
Ernesto doesn"\'"t do rehearsals!

766
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:07,333
He"\'"s too busy hosting that fancy party at the top of his tower.

767
00:40:11,225 --> 00:40:13,122
Chamaco, you can"\'"t run off on me like that.

768
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:15,039
Stop pestering the celebrities.

769
00:40:15,178 --> 00:40:17,089
You said my great-great-grandpa would be here!

770
00:40:17,263 --> 00:40:19,925
He"\'"s halfway across town throwing some big party.

771
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:21,295
That bum.

772
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:22,501
Who doesn"\'"t show up to his own rehearsal?

773
00:40:22,602 --> 00:40:25,344
If you"\'"re such good friends, how come he didn"\'"t invite you?

774
00:40:25,521 --> 00:40:28,228
He"\'"s your great-great-grandpa, how come he didn"\'"t invite you?

775
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:29,885
Hey, Gustavo!

776
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:31,381
You know anything about this party?

777
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:32,812
It"\'"s the hot ticket!

778
00:40:32,904 --> 00:40:36,772
But if you"\'"re not on the guest list, you"\'"re never getting in, Chorizo.

779
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:37,686
Hey!

780
00:40:37,706 --> 00:40:38,433
It"\'"s Chorizo!

781
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:39,180
Choricito!

782
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:40,150
-A-ha.

783
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:40,983
Very funny, guys.

784
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:41,816
Very funny.

785
00:40:41,836 --> 00:40:42,649
-Chorizo?

786
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:44,110
Oh, this guy"\'"s famous!

787
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,441
Go on, go on.

788
00:40:45,461 --> 00:40:46,772
Ask him how he died.

789
00:40:46,918 --> 00:40:48,249
I don"\'"t want to talk about it.

790
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:51,161
He choked on some chorizo!

791
00:40:53,768 --> 00:40:55,494
I didn"\'"t choke, okay?

792
00:40:55,514 --> 00:40:57,240
I got food poisoning which is a big difference.

793
00:40:58,606 --> 00:41:00,167
This is why I don"\'"t like musicians.

794
00:41:00,187 --> 00:41:01,748
Bunch of self-important jerks.

795
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:02,753
-Hey!

796
00:41:02,773 --> 00:41:03,625
I"\'"m a musician!

797
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:04,497
-You are?

798
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:08,512
If you really want to get to Ernesto, there is that music competition...

799
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:10,530
at the Plaza de la Cruz.

800
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,464
Winner gets to play at his party.

801
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:15,474
No, no.

802
00:41:15,494 --> 00:41:17,180
Chamaco, you"\'"re loco if you think--

803
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,886
I need to get my great-great-grandfather"\'"s blessing!

804
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:20,781
You know where I can get a guitar?

805
00:41:22,787 --> 00:41:24,618
I know a guy.

806
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:37,936
Have you found him, Pepita?

807
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:39,415
Have you found our boy?

808
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:41,792
-A footprint!

809
00:41:41,812 --> 00:41:43,123
-It"\'"s a Rivera boot.

810
00:41:43,276 --> 00:41:44,314
-Size seven!

811
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:45,372
-And a half.

812
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:46,297
-Pronated.

813
00:41:46,317 --> 00:41:47,128
-Miguel.

814
00:41:57,488 --> 00:41:59,194
Why the heck would you want to be a musician?

815
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:01,398
My great-great-grandpa was a musician!

816
00:42:01,534 --> 00:42:05,243
Who spent his life performing like a monkey for complete strangers.

817
00:42:05,381 --> 00:42:06,768
No thank you.

818
00:42:06,788 --> 00:42:08,175
No!

819
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:09,582
Guacalal What do you know?

820
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:10,989
So, how far is this guitar anyway?

821
00:42:11,169 --> 00:42:12,033
We"\'"re almost there.

822
00:42:17,393 --> 00:42:18,038
Keep up, chamaco.

823
00:42:18,058 --> 00:42:18,703
Come on.

824
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:28,798
-Cousin Héctor!

825
00:42:28,818 --> 00:42:29,921
-Hey!

826
00:42:29,941 --> 00:42:31,044
These guys!

827
00:42:31,064 --> 00:42:32,167
Hey, Tio!

828
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:33,677
-5‘ Que onda?

829
00:42:33,697 --> 00:42:35,008
-These people are all your family?

830
00:42:36,245 --> 00:42:37,869
In a way.

831
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,513
We"\'"re all the ones with no photos or ofrendas.

832
00:42:39,707 --> 00:42:40,995
No family to go home to.

833
00:42:41,015 --> 00:42:42,303
Nearly forgotten, you know?

834
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:47,110
So, we all call each other cousin, or tio, or whatever.

835
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:52,468
-Héctor!

836
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:53,571
-Tia Chelo!

837
00:42:55,463 --> 00:42:57,374
Muchas gracias!

838
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:58,566
Hey!

839
00:42:58,586 --> 00:42:59,302
Save some for me!

840
00:42:59,322 --> 00:43:00,038
Is Chicharrén around?

841
00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:02,120
Eh, in the bungalow.

842
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,991
Idon"\'"t know if he"\'"s in the mood for visitors.

843
00:43:04,138 --> 00:43:07,096
Who doesn"\'"t like a visit from Cousin Hector?

844
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,061
Buenas noches, Chicharrén!

845
00:43:18,236 --> 00:43:20,693
I don"\'"t want to see your stupid face, Héctor.

846
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:21,950
Come on.

847
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,088
It"\'"s Dia de Muertos.

848
00:43:23,108 --> 00:43:24,226
I brought you a little offering.

849
00:43:24,377 --> 00:43:25,147
-Get out of here.

850
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:25,937
-I would, Cheech.

851
00:43:26,577 --> 00:43:28,989
But the thing is, me and my friend, Miguel...

852
00:43:30,164 --> 00:43:31,950
We really need to borrow your guitar.

853
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:32,880
-My guitar?

854
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,687
-Yes.

855
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:35,696
-My prized beloved guitar?

856
00:43:35,716 --> 00:43:37,567
-I promise we"\'"ll bring it right back.

857
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:39,679
Like the time you promised to bring back my van?

858
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:41,613
Or my mini-fridge?

859
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:43,499
-Ah, you see-— -Or my good napkins?

860
00:43:43,604 --> 00:43:44,391
My lasso?

861
00:43:44,411 --> 00:43:45,198
My femur?

862
00:43:45,398 --> 00:43:47,658
-Well, no, not like those times.

863
00:43:47,678 --> 00:43:49,938
-Where is my femur?

864
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:52,218
You—— -You okay, amigo?

865
00:43:52,238 --> 00:43:54,498
-I"\'"m fading, Héctor.

866
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:58,199
I can feel it.

867
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,969
I couldn"\'"t even play that thing if I wanted to.

868
00:44:04,282 --> 00:44:06,443
You play me something.

869
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:07,828
No.

870
00:44:07,848 --> 00:44:09,049
You know I don"\'"t play anymore, Cheech.

871
00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:10,270
The guitar is for the kid.

872
00:44:10,913 --> 00:44:14,280
You want it, you got to earn it.

873
00:44:16,127 --> 00:44:18,618
Ay, only for you, amigo.

874
00:44:21,465 --> 00:44:22,796
An)’ requests?

875
00:44:24,135 --> 00:44:26,626
You know my favorite, Héctor.

876
00:44:44,363 --> 00:45:02,336
Well, everyone knows Juanita Her eyes each a different color Her teeth stick out And her chin goes in And her...

877
00:45:03,476 --> 00:45:06,311
Knuckles they drag on the ﬂoor -Those aren"\'"t the words.

878
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:09,166
-There are children present.

879
00:45:09,347 --> 00:45:39,369
Her hair is like a briar She stands in a bow—legged stance And if I weren"\'"t so ugly She"\'"d possibly give me a chance Brings back memories.

880
00:45:43,923 --> 00:45:45,538
Gracias.

881
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:17,649
Wait.

882
00:46:17,669 --> 00:46:18,519
What happened?

883
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:20,573
He"\'"s been forgotten.

884
00:46:21,252 --> 00:46:23,959
When there"\'"s no one left in the living world who remembers you...

885
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,600
you disappear from this world.

886
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,080
We call it the final death.

887
00:46:29,802 --> 00:46:31,884
Where did he go?

888
00:46:32,054 --> 00:46:33,385
No one knows.

889
00:46:33,566 --> 00:46:35,377
But I"\'"ve met him.

890
00:46:35,397 --> 00:46:37,208
I could remember him when I go back!

891
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:38,974
No, it doesn"\'"t work like that, chamaco.

892
00:46:39,812 --> 00:46:44,431
Our memories, they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life...

893
00:46:44,608 --> 00:46:47,099
in the stories they tell about us.

894
00:46:48,154 --> 00:46:50,816
But there"\'"s no one left alive to pass down Cheech"\'"s stories.

895
00:46:53,617 --> 00:46:55,653
Hey, it happens to everyone eventually.

896
00:46:55,828 --> 00:46:58,444
Come on, de la Cruzcito, you"\'"ve got a contest to win.

897
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,829
You told me you hated musicians.

898
00:47:12,849 --> 00:47:14,575
You never said you were one.

899
00:47:14,764 --> 00:47:16,629
How do you think I knew your great-great-grandpa?

900
00:47:16,817 --> 00:47:18,088
We used to play music together.

901
00:47:18,108 --> 00:47:19,379
Taught him everything he knows.

902
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:21,632
No manches!

903
00:47:21,652 --> 00:47:23,213
You played with Ernesto de la Cruz...

904
00:47:23,397 --> 00:47:25,103
the greatest musician of all time?

905
00:47:25,284 --> 00:47:27,033
Ah, you"\'"re funny.

906
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,802
Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe.

907
00:47:28,996 --> 00:47:29,807
But his music?

908
00:47:29,827 --> 00:47:30,638
Eh, not so much.

909
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,611
You don"\'"t know what you"\'"re talking about.

910
00:47:46,347 --> 00:47:52,686
Llévelol T-shirts!

911
00:47:52,706 --> 00:47:59,045
Bobbleheadsl Bien venidos a todos!

912
00:48:06,107 --> 00:48:08,473
It"\'"s a battle of the bands, amigos.

913
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:13,853
The winner gets to play for the maestro himself, Ernesto de la Cruz...

914
00:48:14,031 --> 00:48:16,363
at his ﬁesta tonight!

915
00:48:16,784 --> 00:48:18,320
That"\'"s our ticket, muchacho.

916
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:23,162
Let the competition begin!

917
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,836
So, what"\'"s the plan?

918
00:48:40,856 --> 00:48:41,792
What are you gonna play?

919
00:48:41,976 --> 00:48:43,307
Definitely Remember Me.

920
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:44,100
-No!

921
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:44,733
Not that one.

922
00:48:44,753 --> 00:48:45,366
No.

923
00:48:45,386 --> 00:48:45,999
-Come on.

924
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:46,632
It"\'"s his most popular song!

925
00:48:46,814 --> 00:48:48,054
It"\'"s too popular.

926
00:48:48,242 --> 00:48:50,806
Remember me Though I have to travel far -Remember me...

927
00:48:50,826 --> 00:48:53,390
-Don"\'"t let it make you cry...

928
00:48:58,085 --> 00:48:59,176
-What about Poco Loco?

929
00:48:59,196 --> 00:49:00,287
-Epa!

930
00:49:00,307 --> 00:49:01,398
Now that"\'"s a song!

931
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:02,733
De la Cruzcito?

932
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:03,897
You"\'"re on standby.

933
00:49:03,917 --> 00:49:05,061
Los Chachalacos, you"\'"re up next.

934
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,411
Los Chachalacos!

935
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,511
You always this nervous before a performance?

936
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,168
I don"\'"t know.

937
00:49:23,188 --> 00:49:24,664
I"\'"ve never performed before.

938
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:25,820
What?

939
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,798
You said you were a musician!

940
00:49:26,906 --> 00:49:27,676
lam!

941
00:49:27,696 --> 00:49:28,466
I mean, Iwill be.

942
00:49:28,616 --> 00:49:29,261
-Ay!

943
00:49:29,281 --> 00:49:29,926
-Once I win.

944
00:49:30,284 --> 00:49:31,262
That"\'"s your plan?

945
00:49:31,282 --> 00:49:32,260
No.

946
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,258
You have to win.

947
00:49:33,278 --> 00:49:34,256
Your life literally depends on...

948
00:49:34,455 --> 00:49:35,265
you winning.

949
00:49:35,285 --> 00:49:36,095
And you"\'"ve never done this before!

950
00:49:36,115 --> 00:49:36,925
I"\'"ll go up there.

951
00:49:37,124 --> 00:49:37,851
-No!

952
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:38,598
I need to do this.

953
00:49:38,618 --> 00:49:39,345
-Why?

954
00:49:39,533 --> 00:49:43,572
If I can"\'"t go out and play one song, how can I call myself a musician?

955
00:49:43,746 --> 00:49:44,701
What does that matter?

956
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,912
Because I don"\'"tjust want to get de la Cruz"\'"s blessing...

957
00:49:47,124 --> 00:49:50,958
I need to prove that I"\'"m worthy of it.

958
00:49:51,712 --> 00:49:56,331
Oh, that"\'"s such a sweet sentiment at such a bad time!

959
00:49:59,313 --> 00:50:00,197
Okay!

960
00:50:00,217 --> 00:50:01,101
Okay.

961
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:02,005
You want to perform?

962
00:50:02,025 --> 00:50:02,909
Then you got to perform!

963
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:04,589
First, you have to loosen up.

964
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:06,131
Shake off those nerves.

965
00:50:10,648 --> 00:50:12,104
Now give me your best grito.

966
00:50:12,201 --> 00:50:13,027
-My best grito?

967
00:50:13,047 --> 00:50:13,873
-Come on, yell!

968
00:50:13,893 --> 00:50:14,719
Belt it out.

969
00:50:17,957 --> 00:50:19,479
Ah, it feels good.

970
00:50:19,499 --> 00:50:21,021
Okay, now you.

971
00:50:26,497 --> 00:50:28,158
Oh, come on, kid.

972
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:40,749
De la Cruzcito, you"\'"re on now!

973
00:50:40,854 --> 00:50:42,082
Miguel, look at me.

974
00:50:42,102 --> 00:50:43,330
Hey, look at me.

975
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,578
You can do this.

976
00:50:44,682 --> 00:50:46,513
Grab their attention and don"\'"t let it go.

977
00:50:47,111 --> 00:50:48,132
Make them listen, chamaco.

978
00:50:48,152 --> 00:50:49,173
You"\'"ve got this.

979
00:50:49,353 --> 00:50:51,469
De la Cruzcito!

980
00:51:00,374 --> 00:51:01,350
What"\'"s he doing?

981
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:02,346
Why isn"\'"t he playing?

982
00:51:03,117 --> 00:51:05,358
Bring back the singing dogs!

983
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:18,050
Que bien!

984
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:18,979
Vamonos!

985
00:51:18,999 --> 00:51:19,908
Whoo!

986
00:51:28,027 --> 00:51:34,786
What color is the sky?

987
00:51:34,806 --> 00:51:41,565
A y mi amor, ay mi amor You tell me that it"\'"s red A y mi amor, ay mi amor Where should I put my shoes?

988
00:51:41,585 --> 00:51:48,344
A y mi amor, ay mi amor You say put them on your head A y mi amor, ay mi amor You make me un poco loco Un poqui-ti-ti-to loco The way you keep me guessing I"\'"m nodding and I"\'"m yes-ing I"\'"ll count it as a blessing That I"\'"m only un poco loco No!

989
00:51:48,364 --> 00:51:55,123
No!

990
00:51:55,143 --> 00:52:01,902
No!

991
00:52:08,609 --> 00:52:09,920
-Not bad for a dead guy!

992
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,251
-Not so bad yourself, gordito!

993
00:52:11,271 --> 00:52:12,582
Eso!

994
00:52:19,953 --> 00:52:20,701
He"\'"s close!

995
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:21,469
Find him!

996
00:52:21,622 --> 00:52:34,546
The loco that you make me It is just un poco crazy The sense that you"\'"re not making The liberties you"\'"re taking Leaves my cabeza shaking You"\'"re just un poco loco -We"\'"re looking for a living kid.

997
00:52:34,566 --> 00:52:47,490
-About twelve?

998
00:52:47,638 --> 00:52:49,378
Have you seen a living boy?

999
00:52:50,317 --> 00:52:54,874
Un poqui-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-to loco Hey!

1000
00:52:54,894 --> 00:52:59,451
You did good!

1001
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:04,028
I"\'"m proud of you.

1002
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:08,605
Eso!

1003
00:53:09,628 --> 00:53:10,620
Otra!

1004
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,632
Otra!

1005
00:53:11,652 --> 00:53:12,644
Otra!

1006
00:53:18,137 --> 00:53:18,853
-Hey!

1007
00:53:18,873 --> 00:53:19,589
Where are you going?

1008
00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:20,325
-We got to get out of here!

1009
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:21,147
What?

1010
00:53:21,167 --> 00:53:21,883
Are you crazy?

1011
00:53:21,903 --> 00:53:22,619
We"\'"re about to win this thing.

1012
00:53:24,007 --> 00:53:27,499
Damas y cabal/eros, I have an emergency announcement.

1013
00:53:27,688 --> 00:53:30,336
Please be on the lookout for a living boy.

1014
00:53:30,356 --> 00:53:33,004
Answers to the name of Miguel.

1015
00:53:33,183 --> 00:53:36,675
Earlier tonight he ran away from his family.

1016
00:53:36,812 --> 00:53:39,519
Theyjust want to send him back to the Land of the Living.

1017
00:53:39,658 --> 00:53:41,196
Wait, wait.

1018
00:53:41,216 --> 00:53:42,754
You said de la Cruz was your only family.

1019
00:53:42,943 --> 00:53:44,683
The only person who could send you home.

1020
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,941
You could have taken my photo back this whole time?

1021
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:49,496
But they hate music!

1022
00:53:49,516 --> 00:53:50,929
I need a musician"\'"s blessing.

1023
00:53:51,044 --> 00:53:52,020
-You lied to me!

1024
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,016
-You"\'"re one to talk.

1025
00:53:53,172 --> 00:53:54,295
Look at me.

1026
00:53:54,315 --> 00:53:55,438
I"\'"m being forgotten, Miguel.

1027
00:53:55,539 --> 00:53:57,325
I don"\'"t even know if I"\'"m gonna last the night.

1028
00:53:57,499 --> 00:54:00,036
I"\'"m not gonna miss my one chance to cross that bridge because...

1029
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,952
you want to live out some stupid musical fantasy.

1030
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,201
-It"\'"s not stupid!

1031
00:54:04,221 --> 00:54:05,282
-I"\'"m taking you to your family.

1032
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:06,161
-Let go of me!

1033
00:54:06,181 --> 00:54:06,866
-You"\'"ll thank me later.

1034
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,246
You don"\'"t want to help me.

1035
00:54:08,266 --> 00:54:09,452
You only care about yourself!

1036
00:54:10,147 --> 00:54:11,583
Keep your dumb photo.

1037
00:54:11,603 --> 00:54:13,039
Stay away from me!

1038
00:54:13,223 --> 00:54:14,212
No!

1039
00:54:15,903 --> 00:54:17,276
Hey, chamaco!

1040
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:18,669
Where did you go?

1041
00:54:20,073 --> 00:54:21,175
Chamaco!

1042
00:54:21,195 --> 00:54:22,297
I"\'"m sorry!

1043
00:54:22,317 --> 00:54:23,419
Come back!

1044
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,871
Dante, callate!

1045
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:36,342
No!

1046
00:54:36,362 --> 00:54:37,813
Dante, stop it.

1047
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,569
He can"\'"t help me.

1048
00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:41,150
Dante!

1049
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:42,731
Stop!

1050
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:43,824
Stop it!

1051
00:54:43,844 --> 00:54:44,780
Leave me alone!

1052
00:54:45,265 --> 00:54:46,618
You"\'"re not a spirit guide.

1053
00:54:46,638 --> 00:54:47,991
You"\'"re just a dumb dog!

1054
00:54:48,011 --> 00:54:49,364
Now get out of here!

1055
00:54:49,676 --> 00:54:52,258
-It"\'"s him! —|t"\'"s that living boy!

1056
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:52,916
-I heard about him.

1057
00:54:52,936 --> 00:54:53,413
Look!

1058
00:54:53,433 --> 00:54:53,910
-He"\'"s alive!

1059
00:54:54,066 --> 00:54:54,728
-He"\'"s alive.

1060
00:54:54,748 --> 00:54:55,410
-The boy is alive!

1061
00:55:05,943 --> 00:55:08,355
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!

1062
00:55:08,529 --> 00:55:11,191
I am giving you my blessing and you are going home.

1063
00:55:11,365 --> 00:55:12,775
I don"\'"t want your blessing!

1064
00:55:14,117 --> 00:55:15,948
Miguel, stop!

1065
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:19,925
Come back!

1066
00:55:19,945 --> 00:55:21,905
Miguel!

1067
00:55:26,797 --> 00:55:28,537
I am trying to save your life!

1068
00:55:28,684 --> 00:55:29,642
-You"\'"re ruining my life!

1069
00:55:29,662 --> 00:55:30,620
-What?

1070
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:33,100
Music"\'"s the only thing that makes me happy.

1071
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,284
And you want to take it away.

1072
00:55:35,889 --> 00:55:37,629
You"\'"ll never understand.

1073
00:55:40,894 --> 00:55:49,475
Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona No dejaré de quererte...

1074
00:55:50,988 --> 00:55:52,649
I thought you hated music.

1075
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:55,268
I loved it!

1076
00:55:55,288 --> 00:55:57,765
I remember that feeling...

1077
00:55:58,495 --> 00:56:04,491
when my husband would play, and I would sing and nothing else mattered.

1078
00:56:05,919 --> 00:56:10,663
But when we had Coco, suddenly there was something in my life that...

1079
00:56:10,851 --> 00:56:13,373
mattered more than music.

1080
00:56:13,393 --> 00:56:15,915
I wanted to put down roots.

1081
00:56:16,972 --> 00:56:19,634
He wanted to play for the world.

1082
00:56:20,976 --> 00:56:24,184
We each made a sacrifice to get what we wanted.

1083
00:56:24,354 --> 00:56:26,595
Now you must make a choice.

1084
00:56:26,773 --> 00:56:29,515
But I don"\'"t want to pick sides!

1085
00:56:29,703 --> 00:56:31,850
Why can"\'"t you be on my side?

1086
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:34,017
That"\'"s what family"\'"s supposed to do.

1087
00:56:34,207 --> 00:56:36,496
Support you.

1088
00:56:36,516 --> 00:56:38,805
But you never will.

1089
00:56:58,398 --> 00:56:59,584
-Have a good time.

1090
00:56:59,604 --> 00:57:00,790
-Oh, how exciting!

1091
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:03,994
Oh, El Santo.

1092
00:57:04,014 --> 00:57:05,522
I"\'"m a big fan!

1093
00:57:05,542 --> 00:57:07,050
You mind if I...

1094
00:57:12,235 --> 00:57:14,066
Gracias, Senor.

1095
00:57:17,584 --> 00:57:18,457
-Invitation?

1096
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:19,350
-It"\'"s okay.

1097
00:57:19,534 --> 00:57:21,399
I"\'"m Ernesto"\'"s great-great-grandson.

1098
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:34,077
-Discu/pen, seﬁores...

1099
00:57:34,097 --> 00:57:35,158
-Hey, guys!

1100
00:57:35,178 --> 00:57:36,239
It"\'"s poco loco!

1101
00:57:36,436 --> 00:57:37,582
-You were on fire tonight!

1102
00:57:37,602 --> 00:57:38,748
-You too!

1103
00:57:38,939 --> 00:57:40,665
Hey, musician to musician...

1104
00:57:40,685 --> 00:57:42,411
I need a favor.

1105
00:57:45,112 --> 00:57:46,923
The competition winners.

1106
00:57:46,943 --> 00:57:48,754
Congratulations, chicos.

1107
00:57:59,574 --> 00:58:00,609
Thanks, guys!

1108
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:14,215
-Hey!

1109
00:58:14,235 --> 00:58:15,227
Enjoy the party, little musico!

1110
00:58:15,247 --> 00:58:16,239
-Gracias!

1111
00:58:20,804 --> 00:58:21,509
Oh!

1112
00:58:31,616 --> 00:58:32,449
Look!

1113
00:58:32,469 --> 00:58:33,302
It"\'"s Ernesto!

1114
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:36,023
De la Cruz!

1115
00:58:37,487 --> 00:58:38,943
Seﬁor de la Cruz!

1116
00:58:41,209 --> 00:58:44,304
Pardon me!

1117
00:58:44,324 --> 00:58:47,419
Senor de la Cruz!

1118
00:58:47,439 --> 00:58:50,534
Senor de la--

1119
00:58:50,554 --> 00:58:53,649
When you see your moment, you mustn"\'"t let it pass you by.

1120
00:58:53,837 --> 00:58:55,498
You must seize it.

1121
00:58:55,672 --> 00:58:57,663
This one has a wise spirit.

1122
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:14,187
We"\'"re almost there, Dante.

1123
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:20,915
Senor de la Cruz!

1124
00:59:20,935 --> 00:59:23,645
Senor de la--

1125
00:59:23,665 --> 00:59:26,375
But what can we do?

1126
00:59:26,395 --> 00:59:29,105
It is hopeless...

1127
00:59:29,216 --> 00:59:31,027
-You must have faith, sister.

1128
00:59:31,047 --> 00:59:32,858
-But Padre, he will never listen.

1129
00:59:33,043 --> 00:59:35,580
He will listen... to music.

1130
01:00:00,205 --> 01:00:15,599
Senoras y senores, buenas tardes, buenas noches Buenas tardes, buenas noches Senoritas y senores To be here with you tonight Brings me joy!

1131
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:31,013
Qué alegrla For this music is my language And the world es mi familia For this music is my language And the world es mi familia For this music is my language And the world es mi familia For this music is my lang--

1132
01:00:31,033 --> 01:00:46,427
Are you all right, nino?

1133
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:52,275
It"\'"s you!

1134
01:00:52,295 --> 01:00:53,940
You are that boy!

1135
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,605
The one who came from the Land of the Living.

1136
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:57,748
You...know about me?

1137
01:00:57,888 --> 01:01:00,240
You are all anyone has been talking about.

1138
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,612
Why have you come here?

1139
01:01:03,435 --> 01:01:05,497
I"\'"m Miguel.

1140
01:01:05,517 --> 01:01:07,579
Your great-great-grandson.

1141
01:01:08,972 --> 01:01:11,463
I... have a great-great-grandson?

1142
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:15,388
I need your blessing so I can go back home and be a musician.

1143
01:01:15,488 --> 01:01:17,926
Just like you.

1144
01:01:17,946 --> 01:01:20,384
The rest of our family, they wouldn"\'"t listen.

1145
01:01:21,067 --> 01:01:23,729
But I hoped you would.

1146
01:01:25,739 --> 01:01:30,278
My boy, with a talent like yours, how could I not listen?

1147
01:01:33,455 --> 01:01:35,741
I have a great-great-grandson!

1148
01:01:42,515 --> 01:01:43,305
-Look!

1149
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:44,115
It"\'"s Frida!

1150
01:01:44,135 --> 01:01:44,925
-Yes, it is I.

1151
01:01:44,945 --> 01:01:45,735
Frida Kahlo.

1152
01:01:46,144 --> 01:01:47,541
-It is an honor, Senora.

1153
01:01:47,561 --> 01:01:48,958
-Gracias.

1154
01:01:53,193 --> 01:01:55,004
Hey, Negrete!

1155
01:01:55,024 --> 01:01:56,835
Infantel Have you met my great-great-grandson?

1156
01:01:57,437 --> 01:01:59,098
My great-great-grandson.

1157
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,363
He"\'"s alive!

1158
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,506
And a musician to boot!

1159
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,106
Dimple.

1160
01:02:02,126 --> 01:02:02,572
No dimple.

1161
01:02:02,592 --> 01:02:03,038
Dimple.

1162
01:02:03,058 --> 01:02:03,504
No dimple.

1163
01:02:03,652 --> 01:02:04,687
No dimple!

1164
01:02:04,819 --> 01:02:06,104
To our friendship.

1165
01:02:06,247 --> 01:02:09,623
Iwould move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo.

1166
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:13,019
Saludl Poison!

1167
01:02:13,203 --> 01:02:15,319
You know, I did all my own stunts.

1168
01:02:15,455 --> 01:02:19,118
Though I have to say goodbye Remember me...

1169
01:02:21,211 --> 01:02:24,499
All of this came from my amazing fans in the Land of the Living.

1170
01:02:26,299 --> 01:02:29,666
They leave me more offerings than I know what to do with!

1171
01:02:30,397 --> 01:02:31,473
Hey, what"\'"s wrong?

1172
01:02:31,493 --> 01:02:32,569
Is it too much?

1173
01:02:32,589 --> 01:02:33,665
You look overwhelmed.

1174
01:02:33,858 --> 01:02:34,907
-No!

1175
01:02:34,927 --> 01:02:35,976
It"\'"s all great!

1176
01:02:35,996 --> 01:02:37,045
-But?

1177
01:02:37,195 --> 01:02:39,234
It"\'"s just--

1178
01:02:39,254 --> 01:02:41,293
I have been looking up to you my whole life.

1179
01:02:42,107 --> 01:02:45,190
You"\'"re the guy who actually did it!

1180
01:02:45,996 --> 01:02:48,809
But did you ever regret it?

1181
01:02:48,829 --> 01:02:51,642
Choosing music over everything else?

1182
01:02:52,711 --> 01:02:54,439
It was hard.

1183
01:02:54,459 --> 01:02:56,187
Saying goodbye to my hometown.

1184
01:02:56,207 --> 01:02:57,935
Heading off on my own...

1185
01:02:59,374 --> 01:03:00,409
Leaving your family?

1186
01:03:06,256 --> 01:03:09,089
One cannot deny who one is meant to be.

1187
01:03:09,759 --> 01:03:13,877
And you, my great-great-grandson, are meant to be a musician!

1188
01:03:16,443 --> 01:03:18,670
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.

1189
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,917
We cannot belong to one family.

1190
01:03:21,187 --> 01:03:23,428
The world is our family.

1191
01:03:25,066 --> 01:03:27,682
The fireworks have begun!

1192
01:03:38,288 --> 01:03:41,780
Soon the party will move across town for my Sunrise Spectacular.

1193
01:03:43,094 --> 01:03:45,258
Miguel, you must come to the show!

1194
01:03:45,278 --> 01:03:47,442
You will be my guest of honor!

1195
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,661
-You mean it?

1196
01:03:48,681 --> 01:03:49,702
-Of course, my boy.

1197
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:54,371
I can"\'"t.

1198
01:03:54,391 --> 01:03:56,367
I have to get home before sunrise.

1199
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:57,542
Oh!

1200
01:03:57,562 --> 01:03:58,538
I really do need to get you home.

1201
01:04:02,989 --> 01:04:05,216
It has been an honor.

1202
01:04:05,236 --> 01:04:07,463
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.

1203
01:04:08,276 --> 01:04:09,641
I hope you die very soon.

1204
01:04:12,447 --> 01:04:13,857
You know what I mean.

1205
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:18,503
-Miguel, I give you my b|ess--

1206
01:04:18,523 --> 01:04:20,607
-We had a deal, chamaco.

1207
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:22,608
Who are you?

1208
01:04:22,628 --> 01:04:23,979
What is the meaning of this?

1209
01:04:25,178 --> 01:04:26,154
Frida!

1210
01:04:26,174 --> 01:04:27,150
I thought you couldn"\'"t make it.

1211
01:04:28,181 --> 01:04:29,578
You said you"\'"d take back my photo.

1212
01:04:29,598 --> 01:04:30,995
You promised, Miguel.

1213
01:04:31,132 --> 01:04:32,997
You know this man?

1214
01:04:33,186 --> 01:04:34,770
Ijust met him tonight.

1215
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,374
He told me he knew you.

1216
01:04:37,305 --> 01:04:38,920
Héctor?

1217
01:04:39,526 --> 01:04:40,962
Please, Miguel.

1218
01:04:40,982 --> 01:04:42,418
Put my photo up.

1219
01:04:44,145 --> 01:04:47,979
My friend, you"\'"re being forgotten.

1220
01:04:48,076 --> 01:04:49,199
-And whose fault is that?

1221
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,342
-Héctor, please...

1222
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:51,826
Those were my songs you took.

1223
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,219
My songs that made you famous.

1224
01:04:53,363 --> 01:04:54,102
What?

1225
01:04:54,197 --> 01:04:57,360
If I"\'"m being forgotten, it"\'"s because you never told anyone that I wrote them!

1226
01:04:57,502 --> 01:04:59,024
That"\'"s crazy!

1227
01:04:59,044 --> 01:05:00,566
De la Cruz wrote all his own songs.

1228
01:05:00,954 --> 01:05:02,819
You want to tell him or should I?

1229
01:05:02,966 --> 01:05:05,819
Héctor, I never meant to take credit.

1230
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:08,692
We made a great team, but you died...

1231
01:05:08,795 --> 01:05:13,710
and I only sang your songs because I wanted to keep a part of you alive.

1232
01:05:13,883 --> 01:05:15,339
How generous!

1233
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,626
You really did play together.

1234
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:19,813
I don"\'"t want to fight about it.

1235
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,832
Ijust want you to make it right.

1236
01:05:22,016 --> 01:05:25,679
Miguel can put my photo up, and I can cross over the bridge.

1237
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,864
I can see my girl.

1238
01:05:28,884 --> 01:05:31,259
Ernesto, remember the night I left?

1239
01:05:31,401 --> 01:05:32,766
That was a long time ago.

1240
01:05:32,902 --> 01:05:36,235
We drank together and you told me you would move Heaven and Earth...

1241
01:05:36,416 --> 01:05:38,290
for your amigo.

1242
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:40,184
Well, I"\'"m asking you to now.

1243
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,753
Heaven and Earth’?

1244
01:05:41,773 --> 01:05:42,856
Like in the movie?

1245
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:44,214
-What?

1246
01:05:44,234 --> 01:05:45,442
-That"\'"s Don Hida|go"\'"s toast.

1247
01:05:45,874 --> 01:05:47,865
In the de la Cruz movie, El Camino a Casa.

1248
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:48,950
-I"\'"m talking about my real life, Miguel.

1249
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:49,909
-No!

1250
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:50,868
It"\'"s in there.

1251
01:05:50,888 --> 01:05:51,827
Look!

1252
01:05:51,973 --> 01:05:53,493
Never were truer words spoken.

1253
01:05:53,513 --> 01:05:55,033
This calls for a toast.

1254
01:05:55,053 --> 01:05:56,573
To our friendship!

1255
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,342
I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo.

1256
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:02,507
But in the movie, Don Hidalgo poisons the drink.

1257
01:06:03,026 --> 01:06:04,297
—Salud!

1258
01:06:04,317 --> 01:06:05,588
-Poison!

1259
01:06:07,947 --> 01:06:09,594
That night, Ernesto.

1260
01:06:09,614 --> 01:06:11,261
The night I left...

1261
01:06:12,243 --> 01:06:13,201
We"\'"d been performing on the road for months.

1262
01:06:13,221 --> 01:06:14,179
I got homesick...

1263
01:06:16,404 --> 01:06:17,940
and I packed up my songs.

1264
01:06:18,781 --> 01:06:22,148
You want to give up now when we"\'"re this close to reaching our dream?

1265
01:06:22,295 --> 01:06:23,190
This was your dream.

1266
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:24,105
You"\'"ll manage.

1267
01:06:24,245 --> 01:06:25,951
I can"\'"t do this without your songs, Héctor.

1268
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:27,901
I"\'"m going home, Ernesto.

1269
01:06:27,921 --> 01:06:29,732
Hate me if you want, but my mind is made up.

1270
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,413
I could never hate you.

1271
01:06:36,433 --> 01:06:39,206
If you must go, then I"\'"m sending you off with a toast.

1272
01:06:43,014 --> 01:06:44,299
To our friendship.

1273
01:06:44,484 --> 01:06:48,798
Iwould move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo.

1274
01:06:48,818 --> 01:06:53,132
Saludl You walked me to the train station.

1275
01:06:53,152 --> 01:06:57,466
But I felt a pain in my stomach.

1276
01:06:58,404 --> 01:06:59,985
I thought it must have been something I ate.

1277
01:07:00,156 --> 01:07:01,987
Perhaps it was that chorizo, my friend.

1278
01:07:02,659 --> 01:07:04,866
Or something I drank.

1279
01:07:08,498 --> 01:07:10,238
I woke up dead.

1280
01:07:12,168 --> 01:07:14,329
You poisoned me.

1281
01:07:14,504 --> 01:07:17,746
You"\'"re confusing movies with reality, Héctor.

1282
01:07:17,924 --> 01:07:21,166
All this time, I thought it was just bad luck.

1283
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:23,541
I never thought that you might have--

1284
01:07:23,561 --> 01:07:24,497
That you...

1285
01:07:30,488 --> 01:07:31,258
-How could you?

1286
01:07:31,278 --> 01:07:32,048
-Héctor!

1287
01:07:32,198 --> 01:07:32,655
Security!

1288
01:07:32,675 --> 01:07:33,132
Security!

1289
01:07:34,534 --> 01:07:36,323
You took everything away from me!

1290
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,132
You rat!

1291
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:40,830
Have him taken care of.

1292
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:42,058
He"\'"s not well.

1293
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:43,868
Ijust wanted to go back home.

1294
01:07:43,888 --> 01:07:45,131
No!

1295
01:07:45,151 --> 01:07:46,394
No!

1296
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,382
I apologize.

1297
01:07:50,402 --> 01:07:51,986
Where were we?

1298
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:54,491
You were going to give me your blessing.

1299
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:55,740
Yes.

1300
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,821
Sr’.

1301
01:07:59,757 --> 01:08:02,874
Miguel, my reputation...

1302
01:08:03,229 --> 01:08:06,190
It is very important to me.

1303
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:09,171
I would hate to have you think...

1304
01:08:09,309 --> 01:08:12,722
That you murdered Héctor for his songs?

1305
01:08:14,907 --> 01:08:16,320
You don"\'"t think that.

1306
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,753
Do you?

1307
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:19,418
|--

1308
01:08:19,438 --> 01:08:20,946
No.

1309
01:08:20,966 --> 01:08:22,474
Everyone knows you"\'"re the good guy.

1310
01:08:29,412 --> 01:08:31,903
Papa Ernesto, my blessing?

1311
01:08:34,594 --> 01:08:36,061
Security?

1312
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:37,548
Take care of Miguel.

1313
01:08:37,568 --> 01:08:39,035
He"\'"ll be extending his stay.

1314
01:08:39,182 --> 01:08:40,328
What?

1315
01:08:40,348 --> 01:08:41,494
But I"\'"m your family!

1316
01:08:41,632 --> 01:08:43,748
And Héctor was my best friend.

1317
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,919
Success doesn"\'"t come for free, Miguel.

1318
01:08:48,056 --> 01:08:52,846
You have to be willing to do whatever it takes to seize your moment.

1319
01:08:54,062 --> 01:08:55,598
I know you understand.

1320
01:08:55,782 --> 01:08:56,758
No!

1321
01:08:56,778 --> 01:08:57,754
No!

1322
01:08:59,952 --> 01:09:01,365
Let go!

1323
01:09:01,385 --> 01:09:02,798
No!

1324
01:09:25,436 --> 01:09:27,540
Help!

1325
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:29,664
Can anyone hear me?

1326
01:09:29,684 --> 01:09:31,788
I want to go home.

1327
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:51,395
-Héctor?

1328
01:09:51,415 --> 01:09:52,140
-Kid?

1329
01:09:52,338 --> 01:09:54,207
Héctor!

1330
01:09:54,227 --> 01:09:56,096
You were right.

1331
01:09:56,116 --> 01:09:57,985
I should have gone back to my family.

1332
01:09:58,167 --> 01:10:02,410
They told me not to be like de la Cruz, but I didn"\'"t listen.

1333
01:10:02,505 --> 01:10:05,338
I told them I didn"\'"t care if they remembered me.

1334
01:10:05,508 --> 01:10:08,500
I didn"\'"t care if I was on their stupid ofrenda.

1335
01:10:08,646 --> 01:10:09,540
Hey, chamaco.

1336
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,454
It"\'"s okay.

1337
01:10:10,474 --> 01:10:11,368
It"\'"s okay.

1338
01:10:11,514 --> 01:10:13,971
Itold them I didn"\'"t care.

1339
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:19,427
Héctor!

1340
01:10:19,447 --> 01:10:20,844
Héctor?

1341
01:10:21,899 --> 01:10:24,515
She"\'"s forgetting me.

1342
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:26,891
-Who?

1343
01:10:26,911 --> 01:10:28,347
-My daughter.

1344
01:10:30,825 --> 01:10:34,738
She"\'"s the reason you wanted to cross the bridge.

1345
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:38,319
I just wanted to see her again.

1346
01:10:38,339 --> 01:10:41,027
I never should have left Santa Cecilia.

1347
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:44,501
I wish I could apologize.

1348
01:10:44,881 --> 01:10:47,873
I wish I could tell her that her papa was trying to come home.

1349
01:10:48,885 --> 01:10:51,001
That he loved her so much.

1350
01:10:53,389 --> 01:10:54,799
My Coco...

1351
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,970
Coco?

1352
01:11:15,495 --> 01:11:17,531
Where did you get this?

1353
01:11:18,299 --> 01:11:20,235
That"\'"s my Mama Coco.

1354
01:11:20,255 --> 01:11:22,191
That"\'"s my Mama Imelda.

1355
01:11:23,252 --> 01:11:26,039
Is that you?

1356
01:11:29,926 --> 01:11:33,214
We"\'"re... family?

1357
01:11:45,785 --> 01:11:48,012
I always hoped I"\'"d see her again.

1358
01:11:48,032 --> 01:11:50,259
That she"\'"d miss me.

1359
01:11:50,957 --> 01:11:52,768
Maybe put up my photo.

1360
01:11:52,788 --> 01:11:54,599
But it never happened.

1361
01:11:55,952 --> 01:11:57,237
You know the worst part?

1362
01:11:57,787 --> 01:12:00,449
Even if I never got to see Coco in the living world...

1363
01:12:00,633 --> 01:12:03,071
I thought at least one day I"\'"d see her here.

1364
01:12:03,091 --> 01:12:05,529
Give her the biggest hug.

1365
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,337
But she"\'"s the last person who remembers me.

1366
01:12:11,342 --> 01:12:13,503
The moment she"\'"s gone from the living world...

1367
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,753
You disappear... from this one.

1368
01:12:16,773 --> 01:12:19,546
You"\'"ll never get to see her.

1369
01:12:19,725 --> 01:12:21,306
Ever again.

1370
01:12:24,605 --> 01:12:27,096
You know, I wrote her a song once.

1371
01:12:27,817 --> 01:12:31,230
We used to sing it every night at the same time.

1372
01:12:31,904 --> 01:12:34,145
No matter how far apart we were.

1373
01:12:35,491 --> 01:12:40,827
What I wouldn"\'"t give to sing it to her one... last... time.

1374
01:12:42,832 --> 01:13:11,811
Remember me Though I have to say goodbye Remember me Don"\'"t let it make you cry For even if I"\'"m far away I hold you in my heart I sing a secret song to you Each night we are apart Remember me Papa’!

1375
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:31,661
Though I have to travel far Remember me Each time you hear a sad guitar Know that I"\'"m with you The only way that I can be Until you"\'"re in my arms again Remember me He stole your guitar.

1376
01:13:31,681 --> 01:13:51,388
He stole your songs.

1377
01:13:52,234 --> 01:13:55,726
You should be the one the world remembers, not de la Cruz!

1378
01:13:55,915 --> 01:13:57,977
I didn"\'"t write Remember Me for the world.

1379
01:13:57,997 --> 01:14:00,059
I wrote it for Coco.

1380
01:14:02,286 --> 01:14:04,402
I"\'"m a pretty sorry excuse for a great-great-grandpa.

1381
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:06,504
Are you kidding?

1382
01:14:06,524 --> 01:14:08,438
A minute ago I thought I was related to a murderer.

1383
01:14:08,594 --> 01:14:10,969
You"\'"re a total upgrade.

1384
01:14:10,989 --> 01:14:13,364
My whole life, there"\'"s been something...

1385
01:14:13,557 --> 01:14:15,306
that made me different.

1386
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:17,075
And I never knew where it came from.

1387
01:14:17,812 --> 01:14:19,100
But now I know.

1388
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,408
It comes from you.

1389
01:14:21,565 --> 01:14:24,128
I"\'"m proud we"\'"re family!

1390
01:14:24,148 --> 01:14:26,711
I"\'"m proud to be his family!

1391
01:14:33,776 --> 01:14:36,813
I"\'"m proud to be his family!

1392
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,791
Dante?

1393
01:14:54,964 --> 01:14:56,170
Dante!

1394
01:14:58,467 --> 01:15:00,082
It"\'"s Dante!

1395
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,676
-Imelda!

1396
01:15:12,696 --> 01:15:14,132
-Héctor.

1397
01:15:15,025 --> 01:15:16,356
You look good.

1398
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,401
Dante!

1399
01:15:29,421 --> 01:15:30,982
You knew he was my Papa Héctor the whole time!

1400
01:15:31,167 --> 01:15:33,078
You are a real spirit guide.

1401
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:34,448
Who"\'"s the good spirit guide?

1402
01:15:34,468 --> 01:15:35,654
You are!

1403
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,060
Dante!

1404
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,710
There they are!

1405
01:16:21,894 --> 01:16:23,029
Miguel!

1406
01:16:23,049 --> 01:16:24,184
Miguelito!

1407
01:16:24,204 --> 01:16:25,339
Look, it"\'"s Miguel!

1408
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:26,494
He"\'"s all right.

1409
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:28,981
Gracias, Dios mlo.

1410
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,499
Qué bueno.

1411
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,960
Mr"\'"jo, I was so worried!

1412
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:48,940
Thank goodness we found you in time.

1413
01:16:50,256 --> 01:16:51,982
And you...

1414
01:16:52,002 --> 01:16:53,728
How many times must I turn you away?

1415
01:16:53,916 --> 01:16:54,621
Imelda.

1416
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,407
I want nothing to do with you!

1417
01:16:56,427 --> 01:16:58,074
Not in life, not in death!

1418
01:16:58,254 --> 01:17:01,712
I spent decades protecting my family from your mistakes.

1419
01:17:01,841 --> 01:17:05,254
He spends five minutes with you and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!

1420
01:17:05,427 --> 01:17:07,042
I wasn"\'"t in there because of Héctor.

1421
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:09,376
He was in there because of me.

1422
01:17:09,396 --> 01:17:11,583
He was just trying to get me home!

1423
01:17:12,268 --> 01:17:15,760
I didn"\'"t want to listen, but he was right.

1424
01:17:16,397 --> 01:17:18,262
Nothing"\'"s more important than family.

1425
01:17:19,942 --> 01:17:22,604
I"\'"m ready to accept your blessing.

1426
01:17:22,788 --> 01:17:24,764
And your conditions.

1427
01:17:24,784 --> 01:17:26,760
But first, I need to find de la Cruz.

1428
01:17:27,366 --> 01:17:29,106
To get Héctor"\'"s photo.

1429
01:17:29,295 --> 01:17:29,940
-What?

1430
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:30,605
-So he can see Coco again.

1431
01:17:30,713 --> 01:17:32,376
Héctor should be on our ofrenda.

1432
01:17:32,396 --> 01:17:34,059
He"\'"s part of our family.

1433
01:17:34,164 --> 01:17:35,324
He left this family!

1434
01:17:35,467 --> 01:17:37,176
He tried to go home to you and Coco.

1435
01:17:37,196 --> 01:17:38,905
But de la Cruz murdered him!

1436
01:17:40,264 --> 01:17:42,178
-It"\'"s true, Imelda.

1437
01:17:42,198 --> 01:17:44,112
-And so what if it"\'"s true?

1438
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,461
You leave me alone with a child to raise...

1439
01:17:46,635 --> 01:17:48,626
and I"\'"m just supposed to forgive you?

1440
01:17:48,814 --> 01:17:50,394
Imelda, I--

1441
01:17:50,414 --> 01:17:51,994
Héctor!

1442
01:17:54,904 --> 01:17:56,505
I"\'"m running out of time.

1443
01:17:56,525 --> 01:17:58,126
It"\'"s Coco.

1444
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,896
She"\'"s forgetting you.

1445
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:04,619
You don"\'"t have to forgive him.

1446
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:07,014
But we shouldn"\'"t forget him.

1447
01:18:09,575 --> 01:18:11,861
I wanted to forget you.

1448
01:18:13,162 --> 01:18:15,904
I wanted Coco to forget you too, but...

1449
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:17,362
This is my fault.

1450
01:18:17,382 --> 01:18:18,653
Not yours.

1451
01:18:21,086 --> 01:18:22,872
I"\'"m sorry, Imelda.

1452
01:18:27,176 --> 01:18:32,296
Miguel, if we help you get his photo, you will return home?

1453
01:18:32,848 --> 01:18:33,837
No more music?

1454
01:18:35,184 --> 01:18:37,470
Family comes first.

1455
01:18:39,855 --> 01:18:42,972
I can"\'"t forgive you.

1456
01:18:45,152 --> 01:18:46,688
But I will help you.

1457
01:18:49,823 --> 01:18:51,063
So, how do we get to de la Cruz?

1458
01:18:52,117 --> 01:18:54,483
I might know a way.

1459
01:19:45,264 --> 01:19:46,285
—Good luck, muchacho.

1460
01:19:46,305 --> 01:19:47,326
-Gracias, Frida.

1461
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:57,208
-Here, let me help you with--

1462
01:19:57,228 --> 01:19:58,078
-Don"\'"t touch me!

1463
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:00,255
-Everyone clear on the plan?

1464
01:20:00,275 --> 01:20:01,336
-Find Héctor"\'"s photo.

1465
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,351
-Give it to Miguel. —Send Miguel home.

1466
01:20:03,605 --> 01:20:04,720
Got your petals?

1467
01:20:06,442 --> 01:20:08,103
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz.

1468
01:20:08,277 --> 01:20:09,016
Yes?

1469
01:20:10,487 --> 01:20:12,023
Don"\'"t I know you?

1470
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:15,234
That"\'"s for murdering the love of my life!

1471
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:16,134
-Who--

1472
01:20:16,154 --> 01:20:16,911
Who the--

1473
01:20:16,931 --> 01:20:17,688
-She"\'"s talking about me!

1474
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,774
-I"\'"m the love of your life?

1475
01:20:18,794 --> 01:20:19,688
-I don"\'"t know.

1476
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:20,602
I"\'"m still angry at you.

1477
01:20:20,758 --> 01:20:22,181
Héctor!

1478
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:23,624
How did you--

1479
01:20:23,644 --> 01:20:25,067
And that"\'"s for trying to murder my grandson.

1480
01:20:25,304 --> 01:20:26,154
-Grandson?

1481
01:20:26,174 --> 01:20:27,024
-She"\'"s talking about me!

1482
01:20:27,639 --> 01:20:28,923
You!

1483
01:20:28,943 --> 01:20:30,227
Wait.

1484
01:20:30,247 --> 01:20:31,531
You"\'"re related to Héctor?

1485
01:20:31,759 --> 01:20:32,794
The photo!

1486
01:20:37,306 --> 01:20:38,421
After him!

1487
01:20:40,611 --> 01:20:41,609
Security!

1488
01:20:41,629 --> 01:20:42,627
Ayudenme!

1489
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,216
-You said love of your life.

1490
01:20:44,236 --> 01:20:45,672
-I don"\'"t know what I said.

1491
01:20:45,814 --> 01:20:46,929
That"\'"s what I heard.

1492
01:21:00,839 --> 01:21:01,815
Places, Senor.

1493
01:21:01,835 --> 01:21:02,811
You"\'"re on in thirty seconds.

1494
01:21:09,515 --> 01:21:10,356
Ay!

1495
01:21:10,376 --> 01:21:11,217
Miguel!

1496
01:21:11,237 --> 01:21:12,078
I have it!

1497
01:21:28,033 --> 01:21:28,718
Hurry!

1498
01:21:28,738 --> 01:21:29,423
Come on!

1499
01:21:31,652 --> 01:21:32,858
Ladies and gentlemen...

1500
01:21:33,038 --> 01:21:35,976
the one... the only...

1501
01:21:35,996 --> 01:21:38,934
Ernesto de la Cruz!

1502
01:21:48,043 --> 01:21:49,283
Get her off the stage.

1503
01:21:58,063 --> 01:21:59,124
Sing!

1504
01:21:59,144 --> 01:22:00,205
Sing!

1505
01:22:06,405 --> 01:22:59,102
Ay, de mi Llorona Llorona de azul celeste Ay, de mi Llorona Llorona de azul celeste Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona No dejaré de quererte Me subi al pino mas alto, Llorona A ver site divisaba Como el pino era tierno, Llorona AI verme Ilorar, lloraba Ay de mi Llorona, Llorona Llorona de azul celeste Ay de mi Llorona, Llorona Llorona de azul celeste Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona No dejaré de quererte -Let go of me!

1506
01:22:59,122 --> 01:23:51,819
-Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona No dejaré de quererte A y, ay, 3}’ I forgot what that felt like.

1507
01:23:52,292 --> 01:23:54,658
You still got it.

1508
01:24:00,801 --> 01:24:03,508
Miguel, I give you my blessing.

1509
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:08,859
To go home, to put up our photos and to never--

1510
01:24:08,879 --> 01:24:12,548
Never play music again.

1511
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:18,941
To never forget how much your family loves you.

1512
01:24:21,863 --> 01:24:23,148
You"\'"re going home.

1513
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:28,321
You"\'"re not going anywhere.

1514
01:24:30,289 --> 01:24:31,369
Imelda!

1515
01:24:31,717 --> 01:24:33,020
Stay back!

1516
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,343
Stay back!

1517
01:24:34,363 --> 01:24:35,666
All of you, stay back.

1518
01:24:35,686 --> 01:24:36,989
Not one more step.

1519
01:24:38,922 --> 01:24:40,503
Dante!

1520
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:43,767
Ernesto, stop!

1521
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:45,911
Leave the boy alone.

1522
01:24:46,064 --> 01:24:48,103
I"\'"ve worked too hard, Héctor.

1523
01:24:48,123 --> 01:24:50,162
Too hard to let him destroy everything.

1524
01:24:50,309 --> 01:24:52,391
He"\'"s a living child, Ernesto.

1525
01:24:52,561 --> 01:24:53,892
He"\'"s a threat!

1526
01:24:54,062 --> 01:24:57,554
You think I"\'"d let him go back to the Land of the Living with your photo?

1527
01:24:57,701 --> 01:24:59,199
To keep your memory alive?

1528
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:00,717
No.

1529
01:25:00,871 --> 01:25:02,057
-You"\'"re a coward!

1530
01:25:02,077 --> 01:25:03,263
-I am Ernesto de la Cruz.

1531
01:25:03,405 --> 01:25:05,396
The greatest musician of all time!

1532
01:25:05,532 --> 01:25:07,363
Héctor"\'"s the real musician.

1533
01:25:07,492 --> 01:25:09,983
You"\'"re just the guy who murdered him and stole his songs!

1534
01:25:10,078 --> 01:25:10,988
Murdered?

1535
01:25:11,121 --> 01:25:15,034
I am the one who"\'"s willing to do what it takes to seize my moment.

1536
01:25:16,126 --> 01:25:17,206
Whatever it takes.

1537
01:25:19,755 --> 01:25:20,835
No!

1538
01:25:23,008 --> 01:25:24,214
Miguel!

1539
01:25:25,103 --> 01:25:26,750
Apologies, old friend.

1540
01:25:26,770 --> 01:25:28,417
But the show must go on.

1541
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,380
Please, please, mi familia.

1542
01:26:13,517 --> 01:26:15,348
Murderer!

1543
01:26:15,487 --> 01:26:17,676
Orchestra.

1544
01:26:17,696 --> 01:26:19,885
A-one, a-two, a-one--

1545
01:26:19,905 --> 01:26:22,094
Remember me Though I have to s--

1546
01:26:22,114 --> 01:26:24,303
Hey!

1547
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:27,273
Look!

1548
01:26:48,093 --> 01:26:49,333
Nice kitty.

1549
01:26:53,191 --> 01:26:54,019
Put me down!

1550
01:26:54,039 --> 01:26:54,867
No, please!

1551
01:26:54,887 --> 01:26:55,715
I beg of you!

1552
01:26:55,735 --> 01:26:56,563
Stop!

1553
01:26:56,583 --> 01:26:57,411
Stop!

1554
01:26:57,431 --> 01:26:58,259
No!

1555
01:27:06,663 --> 01:27:07,388
No!

1556
01:27:07,408 --> 01:27:08,133
No!

1557
01:27:20,167 --> 01:27:21,247
What did I miss?

1558
01:27:21,543 --> 01:27:22,999
Good boy, Dante!

1559
01:27:23,295 --> 01:27:24,501
Miguel!

1560
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:27,258
Héctor!

1561
01:27:27,278 --> 01:27:28,562
The photo...

1562
01:27:28,582 --> 01:27:29,866
I lost it!

1563
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:31,791
It"\'"s okay, mr"\'"jo.

1564
01:27:31,811 --> 01:27:33,123
It"\'"s 0--

1565
01:27:33,143 --> 01:27:34,455
Héctor!

1566
01:27:34,475 --> 01:27:35,787
Héctor?

1567
01:27:37,142 --> 01:27:38,006
Coco.

1568
01:27:38,153 --> 01:27:39,089
No!

1569
01:27:39,109 --> 01:27:40,045
We can still find the photo.

1570
01:27:40,645 --> 01:27:42,260
Miguel, it"\'"s almost sunrise.

1571
01:27:43,575 --> 01:27:44,300
No, no.

1572
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,045
I can"\'"t leave you.

1573
01:27:45,368 --> 01:27:47,578
I promised I"\'"d put your photo up.

1574
01:27:47,598 --> 01:27:49,808
I promised you"\'"d see Coco.

1575
01:27:49,988 --> 01:27:51,979
We"\'"re both out of time, mr"\'"jo.

1576
01:27:53,418 --> 01:27:54,452
Oh no!

1577
01:27:54,472 --> 01:27:55,506
No!

1578
01:27:55,526 --> 01:27:56,560
She can"\'"t forget you!

1579
01:27:56,745 --> 01:28:00,579
Ijust wanted her to know that I loved her.

1580
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:03,590
-Héctor!

1581
01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:05,524
-You have our blessing, Miguel.

1582
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:06,910
No conditions.

1583
01:28:08,099 --> 01:28:09,432
No!

1584
01:28:09,452 --> 01:28:10,785
Papa Héctor, please!

1585
01:28:15,055 --> 01:28:16,090
No!

1586
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:19,589
—Go home.

1587
01:28:19,609 --> 01:28:21,506
-I promise I won"\'"t let Coco forget you!

1588
01:28:48,755 --> 01:28:49,961
There he is!

1589
01:28:51,434 --> 01:28:52,370
Miguel!

1590
01:28:52,390 --> 01:28:53,326
Stop!

1591
01:28:58,483 --> 01:28:59,880
-Where have you been?

1592
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:01,297
-I need to see Mama Coco, please.

1593
01:29:01,486 --> 01:29:02,797
What are you doing with that--

1594
01:29:02,817 --> 01:29:04,128
Give it to me!

1595
01:29:04,823 --> 01:29:06,248
Miguel, stop!

1596
01:29:06,268 --> 01:29:07,693
Miguel!

1597
01:29:07,713 --> 01:29:09,138
Miguel!

1598
01:29:10,495 --> 01:29:11,738
Mama Coco?

1599
01:29:11,758 --> 01:29:13,001
Can you hear me?

1600
01:29:13,021 --> 01:29:14,264
It"\'"s Miguel.

1601
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:16,102
I saw your papa.

1602
01:29:16,122 --> 01:29:17,266
Remember?

1603
01:29:17,286 --> 01:29:18,430
Papa?

1604
01:29:19,796 --> 01:29:21,608
Please!

1605
01:29:21,628 --> 01:29:23,440
If you forget him, he"\'"ll be gone.

1606
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:25,272
Forever.

1607
01:29:26,042 --> 01:29:27,157
Miguel, open this door!

1608
01:29:27,345 --> 01:29:28,796
Here.

1609
01:29:28,816 --> 01:29:30,267
This was his guitar, right?

1610
01:29:30,287 --> 01:29:31,738
He used to play it to you?

1611
01:29:34,644 --> 01:29:35,798
See?

1612
01:29:35,818 --> 01:29:36,972
There he is!

1613
01:29:36,992 --> 01:29:38,146
Papa!

1614
01:29:38,166 --> 01:29:39,320
Remember?

1615
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:40,494
Papa?

1616
01:29:44,195 --> 01:29:45,453
-Miguel!

1617
01:29:45,473 --> 01:29:46,731
-Mama Coco, please!

1618
01:29:46,751 --> 01:29:48,009
Don"\'"t forget him.

1619
01:29:54,789 --> 01:29:55,698
What are you doing to that poor woman?

1620
01:29:55,718 --> 01:29:56,627
It"\'"s okay, Mamita.

1621
01:29:56,647 --> 01:29:57,556
It"\'"s okay.

1622
01:29:57,699 --> 01:29:59,189
What"\'"s gotten into you?

1623
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:07,702
I thought I"\'"d lost you, Miguel.

1624
01:30:07,876 --> 01:30:09,286
I"\'"m sorry, Papa.

1625
01:30:09,471 --> 01:30:10,969
We"\'"re all together now.

1626
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,487
That"\'"s what matters.

1627
01:30:13,548 --> 01:30:14,663
Not all of us.

1628
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:17,372
It"\'"s okay, Mamita.

1629
01:30:17,392 --> 01:30:19,955
Miguel, you apologize to your Mama Coco.

1630
01:30:23,391 --> 01:30:24,801
Mama Coco?

1631
01:30:29,574 --> 01:30:30,424
Well?

1632
01:30:30,444 --> 01:30:31,294
Apologize!

1633
01:30:35,705 --> 01:30:38,581
Mama Coco?

1634
01:30:38,601 --> 01:30:41,477
Your papa, he wanted you to have this.

1635
01:30:43,411 --> 01:30:45,197
Mama, wait!

1636
01:30:45,382 --> 01:31:22,143
Remember me Though I have to say goodbye Remember me Don"\'"t let it make you cry For even if I"\'"m far away I hold you in my heart I sing a secret song to you Each night we are apart Remember me Though I have to travel far Remember me Each time you hear a sad guitar Know that I"\'"m with you The only way that I can be Until you"\'"re in my arms again Remember me Elena?

1637
01:31:22,163 --> 01:31:58,924
What"\'"s wrong, mr"\'"ja?

1638
01:32:00,165 --> 01:32:02,039
Nothing, Mama.

1639
01:32:02,059 --> 01:32:03,933
Nothing at all.

1640
01:32:04,993 --> 01:32:08,326
My papa used to sing me that song.

1641
01:32:08,997 --> 01:32:11,113
He loved you, Mama Coco.

1642
01:32:11,791 --> 01:32:15,409
Your papa loved you so much.

1643
01:32:34,022 --> 01:32:37,355
I kept his letters.

1644
01:32:38,036 --> 01:32:40,138
Poems he wrote me.

1645
01:32:40,158 --> 01:32:42,260
And...

1646
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,382
Papa was a musician.

1647
01:33:05,053 --> 01:33:06,793
When I was a little girl...

1648
01:33:09,557 --> 01:33:12,720
he and Mama would sing such beautiful songs.

1649
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:29,574
And right over here, one of Santa Cecilia"\'"s greatest treasures.

1650
01:33:29,828 --> 01:33:33,412
The home of the esteemed song writer, Héctor Rivera.

1651
01:33:34,207 --> 01:33:37,825
The letters Héctor wrote home for his daughter, Coco, contain the lyrics...

1652
01:33:38,012 --> 01:33:39,761
for all of your favorite songs.

1653
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:41,530
Not just Remember Me.

1654
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:47,592
And that man is your Papa Julio.

1655
01:33:47,762 --> 01:33:50,925
And there"\'"s Tr’a Rosita and your Tia Victoria.

1656
01:33:51,099 --> 01:33:53,932
And those two are Oscar and Felipe.

1657
01:33:54,602 --> 01:33:57,059
These aren"\'"tjust old pictures, they"\'"re our family...

1658
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:59,266
and they"\'"re counting on us to remember them.

1659
01:34:17,125 --> 01:34:28,420
Say that I"\'"m crazy or call me a fool Enjoy your visit, Héctor.

1660
01:34:30,315 --> 01:34:34,879
But last night it seemed that I dreamed about you -Papa!

1661
01:34:34,899 --> 01:34:39,463
-Coco!

1662
01:34:39,647 --> 01:36:01,184
When I opened my mouth what came out was a song And you know every word and we all sang along To a melody played on the strings of our souls And a rhythm that rattled us down to the bone Our love for each other will live on forever In every beat of my proud corazon Our love for each other will live on forever In every beat of my proud corazon A y mi familia Oiga mi gente Canten a coro Let it be known Our love for each other will live on forever In every beat of my proud corazon A y mi familia Oiga mi gente Canten a coro Let it be known Our love for each other will live on forever In every beat of my proud corazon
