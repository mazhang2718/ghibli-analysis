1
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,495
Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.

2
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,457
Because of something that happened
before I was even born.

3
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:18,502
See, a long time ago,
there was this family.

4
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:21,710
The papa, he was a musician.

5
00:01:22,723 --> 00:01:26,341
He and his family would sing
and dance and count their blessings.

6
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:31,395
But he also had a dream.
To play for the world.

7
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:40,362
And one day, he left with his guitar
and never returned.

8
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,406
And the mamé...

9
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,333
She didn't have time to cry
over that walk—away musician.

10
00:01:55,922 --> 00:02:00,666
After banishing all music from her life
she found a way...

11
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:02,254
to provide for her daughter.

12
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:09,599
She rolled up her sleeves
and she learned to make shoes.

13
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:20,277
She could have made candy,
or ﬁreworks, or sparkly unden/vear...

14
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:25,407
for wrestlers, but no, she chose shoes.

15
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:30,282
Then she taught her daughter
to make shoes.

16
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,207
And later, she taught her son—in—law.

17
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:37,452
Then her grandkids got roped in.

18
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:41,794
As her family grew,
so did the business.

19
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:46,132
Music had torn her family apart.

20
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:49,260
But shoes held them all together.

21
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:55,137
You see, that woman was my great-
great—grandmother, Mamé Imelda.

22
00:02:56,483 --> 00:02:58,769
She died way before I was born.

23
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,813
But my family still tells her story
every year on Dia de los Muertos...

24
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,321
the Day of the Dead.

25
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,489
And her little girl, she's my
great—grandmother, Mamé Coco.

26
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:11,949
Hola, Mama’ Coco.

27
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:14,660
How are you, Julio?

28
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:16,992
Actually, my name is Miguel.

29
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,747
Mama Coco has trouble
remembering things.

30
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:24,917
But it's good to talk to her anyway.
So, I tell her pretty much everything.

31
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:29,221
I used to run like this. But now
I run like this which is way faster.

32
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:32,675
And the winner is Luchadora Coco!

33
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:36,098
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.

34
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:38,054
Dimple, no dimple. Dimple, no dimple.

35
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,266
Miguel, eat your food.

36
00:03:40,444 --> 00:03:42,810
My abuelita, she's
Mama Coco's daughter.

37
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:45,980
Oh, you're a twig, mijo.
Have some more.

38
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:47,147
No, gracias.

39
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:50,442
I asked if you would like more tamalesl

40
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,655
Si?

41
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,162
That's what I thought you said!

42
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:57,624
Abuelita runs our house
just like Mama Imelda did.

43
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:01,627
No music!

44
00:04:03,216 --> 00:04:04,331
No music!

45
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:07,626
-Y aunque la vida
-No music!

46
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:11,259
I think we're the only family in México
who hates music.

47
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:14,808
And my family's ﬁne with that. But me...

48
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:17,060
-Be back by lunch, mijo.
—Love you, Mama.

49
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:20,730
I am not like the rest of my family!

50
00:04:21,943 --> 00:04:23,399
-Hola, Miguel!
-Hola!

51
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:31,570
-Muchas gracias.
-De nada, Miguel.

52
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,990
Hey! Dante!

53
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:43,212
Sit. Down. Roll over. Shake.

54
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:45,167
Fist bump!

55
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:47,207
Good boy, Dante!

56
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:53,672
I know I'm not supposed to love music.

57
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,183
But it's not my fault! It's his!

58
00:04:57,354 --> 00:05:01,939
Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician of all time.

59
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:07,603
Right here in this very plaza,
Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps...

60
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:11,148
toward becoming the most beloved
singer in Mexican history.

61
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,778
He started out a total nobody
from Santa Cecilia, like me.

62
00:05:17,123 --> 00:05:20,957
But when he played music,
he made people fall in love with him.

63
00:05:21,878 --> 00:05:23,618
He starred in movies.

64
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:27,960
He had the coolest guitar! He could ﬂy!

65
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,842
And he wrote the best songs.

66
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:32,794
But my all—time favorite, it's...

67
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,632
-Remember me
-Remember me

68
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,471
Though I have to say goodbye

69
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:40,264
-Remember me
-Remember me

70
00:05:40,438 --> 00:05:44,147
Don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away

71
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:45,978
I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you

72
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:50,779
Each night we are apart
Remember me

73
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,905
Though I have to travel far

74
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:54,654
-Remember me
-Remember me

75
00:05:54,828 --> 00:05:56,989
Each time you hear a sad guitar

76
00:05:57,122 --> 00:06:01,286
Know that I'm with you
the only way that I can be

77
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:05,331
Until you're in my arms again

78
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:07,496
He lived the kind of life
you dream about.

79
00:06:12,095 --> 00:06:13,676
Until 1942.

80
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:18,719
When he was crushed by a giant bell.

81
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:22,098
I want to be just like him.

82
00:06:28,278 --> 00:06:33,944
Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and
I get this feeling like we're connected.

83
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:39,365
Like if he could play music,
maybe someday, I could too.

84
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:42,204
If it wasn't for my family.

85
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:44,666
-Ay-ay-ay, muchacho.
-Huh?

86
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:46,952
I asked for a shoe shine
not your life story.

87
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,540
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

88
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:52,378
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home. So...

89
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:55,544
If I were you, I'd march
right up to my family and say...

90
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:58,054
"Hey, I'm a musician. Deal with it."

91
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:01,591
—I could never say that.
—You are a musician, no?

92
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:05,554
I don't know.
I mean, I only really play for myself.

93
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:10,563
Did de la Cruz become the world's
best musician by hiding his skills’?

94
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:15,697
No! He walked out onto that plaza
and he played out loud.

95
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:17,653
Mira, mira, they're
setting up for tonight!

96
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:20,615
The music competition
for Dla de Muertos.

97
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:23,238
You want to be like your hero?
You should sign up!

98
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,657
Uh—uh. My family would freak!

99
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:29,710
Look, if you're too scared
then, well, have fun making shoes.

100
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,331
Come on, what did
de la Cruz always say?

101
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:35,417
Seize your moment?

102
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,674
Show me what you got, muchacho.

103
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:41,847
I'll be your first audience.

104
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:50,105
Miguel!

105
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:53,605
-Abuelita!
—What are you doing here?

106
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:57,731
You leave my grandson alone.

107
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:59,823
Doﬁa, please! Iwasjust getting a shine.

108
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:03,028
I know your tricks, mariachi.
What did he say to you?

109
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:04,659
He was just showing me his guitar.

110
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:05,909
Shame on you.

111
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:11,788
My grandson is a sweet little
angelito querido cielito.

112
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:15,882
He wants no part of your music,
mariachi. You keep away from him.

113
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:22,973
Ay, pobrecito. Oh, estas bien, mijo.

114
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,386
You know better than to
be here in this place!

115
00:08:27,564 --> 00:08:30,647
You will come home. Now.

116
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:44,995
How many times have we told you?
That plaza is crawling with mariachis.

117
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:46,491
Yes, Tio Berto.

118
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:50,125
-No, no, no, no, no!
—Go away, you. Go!

119
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:51,455
It's just Dante.

120
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:56,669
Never name a street dog. They'll follow
you forever. Now, go get my shoe.

121
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:05,594
I found your son in Mariachi Plaza.

122
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:06,925
AM Miguel!

123
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,136
You know how Abuelita feels
about the plaza.

124
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:12,021
-I was just shining shoes.
-A musician's shoes!

125
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:16,185
But the plaza's where
all the foot traffic is.

126
00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:19,980
If Abuelita says no more plaza,
then no more plaza.

127
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:22,198
-But what about tonight?
—What's tonight?

128
00:09:22,368 --> 00:09:26,828
Well, they're having this talent show.
And Ithought I might...

129
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:29,948
—Sign up?
—well, maybe?

130
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:33,250
You have to have talent
to be in a talent show.

131
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:36,045
What are you gonna do? Shine shoes?

132
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:37,793
It's Dla de los Muertos.

133
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:41,047
No one's going anywhere.
Tonight is about family.

134
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:44,007
Ofrenda room. Va’monos.

135
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:56,520
Don't give me that look.

136
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:59,356
Dia de los Muertos is
the one night of the year

137
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:01,362
our ancestors can come visit us.

138
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:05,526
We've put their photos on the ofrenda
so their spirits can cross over.

139
00:10:05,703 --> 00:10:07,489
That is very important.

140
00:10:07,622 --> 00:10:10,409
If we don't put them up,
they can't come.

141
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:14,826
We made all this food, set out
the things they loved in life, mijo.

142
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:18,087
All this work to bring
the family together.

143
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:23,381
I don't want you sneaking off to who
knows where. Where are you going?

144
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:24,506
I thought we were done.

145
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:29,341
Ay, Dios mio. Being part of this family
means being here for this family.

146
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:33,178
-I don't want to see you end up Iike--
-Like Mama’ Coco's papa’?

147
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:36,351
Never mention that man!
He's better off forgotten.

148
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:37,431
But you're the one who——

149
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:38,642
I was just——

150
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:40,021
But-- I--

151
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:43,276
Papa? Papa is home?

152
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:46,199
Mama’, calmese, calmese.

153
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:47,696
Papa’ is coming home?

154
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:51,120
No, Mama. It's okay. I'm here.

155
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:53,873
Who are you?

156
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:56,621
Rest, Mama.

157
00:10:57,547 --> 00:11:02,541
I'm hard on you because I care, Miguel.
Miguel? Miguel?

158
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:07,803
What are we going to do with that boy?

159
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,767
You're right. That's just what he needs.

160
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:40,370
It's you. Get in here.
Come on, Dante. Hurry up!

161
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:45,254
You're gonna get me in trouble, boy.
Someone could hear me.

162
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:52,014
I wish someone wanted to hear me.

163
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:56,223
Other than you. Ew. Okay.

164
00:11:58,691 --> 00:11:59,806
Perfecto!

165
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:35,550
I have to sing. I have to play!

166
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:40,476
The music, it's not just in me, it is me.

167
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:45,355
When life gets me down,
I play my guitar.

168
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:51,400
The rest of the world may follow
the rules, but I must follow my heart.

169
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:56,405
You know that feeling
like there's a song in the air and...

170
00:12:56,582 --> 00:12:57,913
it's playing just for you?

171
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:05,004
A feeling so close...

172
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:09,960
you could reach out and touch it

173
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:15,674
I never knew I could want
something so much, but it's true

174
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,385
You must have faith, sister.

175
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:20,887
Oh, but, Padre, he will never listen.

176
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:22,726
He will listen. To music.

177
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:29,105
Only a song, only a song
has the power to change a heart

178
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:36,278
Never underestimate
the power of music.

179
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:44,119
But my father,
he will never give his permission.

180
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:45,912
I am done asking permission.

181
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,877
When you see your moment,
you mustn't let it pass you by.

182
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:50,792
You must seize it!

183
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:54,887
Seﬁor de la Cruz, what did it take
for you to seize your moment?

184
00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:01,428
I had to have faith in my dream.
No one was going to hand it to me.

185
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:03,771
It was up to me to reach for that dream.

186
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:07,308
—Grab it tight and make it come true.
-...and make it come true.

187
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:15,442
No more hiding, Dante.
I got to seize my moment!

188
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:19,866
I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza
if it kills me.

189
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:26,248
Dia de los Muertos has begun!

190
00:14:26,923 --> 00:14:30,086
No, no. We have to make a clear path.

191
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:34,673
The petals guide our ancestors home.
We don't want their spirits to get lost.

192
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:38,840
We want them to come and enjoy
all the food and drinks on the ofrenda.

193
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:42,844
Mama! Where should we put this table?

194
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:44,512
In the courtyard, mr'jos.

195
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,807
-You want it down by the kitchen?
-SI. Next to the other one.

196
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:53,814
—Get under! Get under!
-Miguel?

197
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,317
Nothing! Mama, Papa. I--

198
00:14:57,453 --> 00:15:01,913
Miguel, your abuelita had
the most wonderful idea.

199
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:06,121
We've all decided.
It's time you joined us in the workshop!

200
00:15:06,212 --> 00:15:07,292
What?

201
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,711
No more shining shoes.

202
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:11,631
You'll be making them every day
after school.

203
00:15:11,717 --> 00:15:17,337
Oh! Our MigueIi—ti—ti—ti—to carrying on
the family tradition.

204
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:22,433
And on Dia de los Muertos!
Your ancestors will be so proud.

205
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:26,146
You'll craft huaraches
just like your Tia Victoria.

206
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:28,894
And wingtips like your Papa Julio.

207
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:31,400
But what if I'm no good
at making shoes?

208
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:35,071
Ah, Miguel.
You have your family here to guide you.

209
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,034
You are a Rivera. And a Rivera is...

210
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,742
A shoemaker. Through and through.

211
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,742
That's my boy! Berto!

212
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,661
Break out the good stuff.
I want to make a toast.

213
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:03,098
Dante! No, Dante. Stop!

214
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:16,987
No, no, no, no, no! No.

215
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:31,122
De la Cruz's guitar?

216
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:34,460
Papa ? Papa?

217
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:39,589
Mama Coco,
is your papa Ernesto de la Cruz?

218
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,130
Papa! Papa!

219
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:55,817
Papa! Papa! It's him!

220
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,903
I know who my
great—great—grandfather was.

221
00:16:58,032 --> 00:16:59,647
Miguel, get down from there.

222
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:02,696
Mama Coco's father was
Ernesto de la Cruz!

223
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:06,496
—What are you talking about?
-I'm gonna be a musician!

224
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:11,747
What is all this?
You keep secrets from your own family?

225
00:17:11,837 --> 00:17:13,668
It's all that time he spends in the plaza.

226
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:16,623
—Fills his head with crazy fantasies.
—It's not a fantasy.

227
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:20,635
That man was Ernesto de la Cruz!
The greatest musician of all time!

228
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:22,507
We've never known anything
about this man!

229
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:25,886
But whoever he was,
he still abandoned his family.

230
00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:27,633
This is no future for my son.

231
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:30,310
But, Papa, you said
my family would guide me.

232
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:32,810
Well, de la Cruz is my family.

233
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,356
I'm supposed to play music.

234
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:38,603
Never! That man's music was a curse.
Iwill not allow it.

235
00:17:38,698 --> 00:17:40,359
—If you would just |et——
-Miguel...

236
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:43,240
You will listen to your family.
No more music.

237
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:46,532
—Just listen to me play!
—End of argument.

238
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,703
You want to end up like that man?
Forgotten?

239
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:53,208
Left off your family's ofrenda?

240
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:55,870
I don't care if I'm on
some stupid ofrenda.

241
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:00,086
-No!
-Mama!

242
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:08,432
There. No guitar. No music.

243
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:16,141
Oh, come. You'll feel better after you eat
with your family.

244
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:18,191
I don't want to be in this family!

245
00:18:18,904 --> 00:18:20,485
Miguel! Miguel!

246
00:18:39,258 --> 00:18:43,217
I want to play in the plaza,
like de la Cruz. Can I still sign up?

247
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:44,422
You got an instrument?

248
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:47,297
No. But if I can borrow a guitar...

249
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:49,094
Musicians got to bring
their own instruments.

250
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:50,682
You find a guitar, kid,
I'll put you on the list.

251
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,853
-Can I borrow your guitar?
—Sorry, muchacho.

252
00:18:57,943 --> 00:19:00,355
-You guys have a spare guitar?
-No.

253
00:19:01,072 --> 00:19:04,610
—I need a guitarjust for a little bit.
—Get out of here, kid.

254
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:21,794
Great—great—grandfather,
what am I supposed to do?

255
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:03,874
No, no, no, no. Dante, stop! Callatel Sh!

256
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:26,771
I'm sorry.

257
00:21:03,235 --> 00:21:08,446
Senor de la Cruz, please don't be mad.
I'm Miguel.

258
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:13,235
Your great-great grandson.
I need to borrow this.

259
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,656
Our family thinks music is a curse.

260
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:22,247
None of them understand
but I know you would have.

261
00:21:22,588 --> 00:21:26,547
You would have told me to follow
my heart. To seize my moment!

262
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:33,513
So, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna
play in the plaza. Just like you did!

263
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:44,227
The guitar! It's gone!

264
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:46,433
Somebody stole de la Cruz's guitar!

265
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:48,436
The window's broken. Look!

266
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:54,908
All right, who's in there?

267
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:58,074
I'm sorry. It's not what it looks like.
De la Cruz is my—-

268
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:01,949
There's nobody here.

269
00:22:17,476 --> 00:22:18,761
-Miguel!
-Mama!

270
00:22:18,852 --> 00:22:23,812
Miguel, come home.
Where are you, Miguel?

271
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:31,479
Dios mio! Little boy. Are you okay?
Here. Let me help you.

272
00:22:32,992 --> 00:22:34,732
Thanks. I--

273
00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:46,665
Do you mind? Whoa!

274
00:23:07,568 --> 00:23:10,310
Look how big she's getting.

275
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:14,980
Dante!

276
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:21,200
You can see me? Wait!
What's going on? Dante!

277
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:24,873
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

278
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:25,624
Miguel?

279
00:23:25,711 --> 00:23:27,622
-Miguel?
-Miguel?

280
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:34,500
You're here? Here, here.
And you can see us?

281
00:23:34,678 --> 00:23:37,135
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to!

282
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:38,712
Remind me how I know you.

283
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:40,714
We're your family, mr'jo.

284
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:45,102
-Tia Rosita?
-Si.

285
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:49,390
-Papa Julio?
-Hola,

286
00:23:50,402 --> 00:23:51,733
Tr’a Victoria?

287
00:23:51,904 --> 00:23:54,190
He doesn't seem entirely dead.

288
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,072
He's not quite alive either.

289
00:23:57,242 --> 00:23:59,858
We need Mama Imelda.
She'll know how to fix this.

290
00:24:00,037 --> 00:24:03,575
Oye! It's Mama Imelda.

291
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,372
She couldn't cross over.

292
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:07,916
-She's stuck!
-On the other side!

293
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:10,494
Tio Oscar? Tio Felipe?

294
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:11,704
Oh. Hey, Miguel.

295
00:24:12,424 --> 00:24:15,006
I have a feeling
this has something to do with you.

296
00:24:15,094 --> 00:24:17,130
But if Mama’ Imelda can't come to us...

297
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:19,507
Then we are going to her. Vamonos!

298
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:37,355
Come on, Miguel. It's okay.

299
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:54,872
Dante? Dante! Dante, wait up!

300
00:24:57,302 --> 00:25:01,966
You got to stay with me, boy.
We don't know... where...

301
00:25:22,578 --> 00:25:25,991
This isn't a dream then.
You're all really out there.

302
00:25:26,165 --> 00:25:27,826
-You thought we weren't?
-Well, I don't know.

303
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:31,621
I thought it might've been one of those
made up things that adults tell kids.

304
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:35,420
-Like vitamins.
-Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.

305
00:25:35,507 --> 00:25:37,088
Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.

306
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,093
Mija, it's not nice to stare at--
Ay! Santa Maria!

307
00:25:49,188 --> 00:25:53,272
Are those... Alebrijes! But those are--

308
00:25:53,442 --> 00:25:56,104
Real alebrijes. Spirit creatures.

309
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:57,856
They guide souls on theirjourney.

310
00:25:57,988 --> 00:25:59,694
Watch your step.
They make caquitas everywhere.

311
00:26:00,324 --> 00:26:02,360
Welcome back to the Land of the Dead.

312
00:26:02,534 --> 00:26:05,196
Please have all offerings ready
for re—entry.

313
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,452
Welcome back. Anything to declare?

314
00:26:07,623 --> 00:26:09,033
Some churros. From my family.

315
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:11,039
How wonderful. Next.

316
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,543
If you are experiencing travel issues,
agents at the Department of Family...

317
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:17,204
Reunions are available to assist you.

318
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:18,376
Next family, please.

319
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:26,221
Oh! Your photos are on your son's
ofrenda. Have a great visit.

320
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:27,130
Gracias.

321
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:30,384
And remember to return
before sunrise. Enjoy your visit.

322
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:36,391
Next. Your photo's on your
dentist's ofrenda. Enjoy your visit.

323
00:26:36,485 --> 00:26:38,066
-Gracias.
-Next?

324
00:26:40,572 --> 00:26:42,608
Yes! It is I. Frida Kahlo.

325
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:44,447
Shall we skip the scanner?

326
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:47,909
I'm on so many ofrendas
it'll just ovenrvhelm your blinky thingy.

327
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:54,166
Well, shoot, looks like
no one put up your photo, Frida.

328
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:58,545
Okay, when I said Iwas Frida, just now,
that was a lie.

329
00:26:58,715 --> 00:26:59,921
And I apologize for doing that.

330
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,917
No photo on an ofrenda,
no crossing the bridge.

331
00:27:03,011 --> 00:27:06,378
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.

332
00:27:08,141 --> 00:27:09,051
Hey!

333
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:19,017
A|most...there. Just a little further.

334
00:27:24,074 --> 00:27:25,234
Ulosy-daisy_._

335
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:29,197
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?
Dumb flower bridge!

336
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:33,284
Aw. I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.

337
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:35,540
-Next?
-Oh! Come, mr'jo. It's ourturn.

338
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:38,706
Welcome back, amigos.
Anything to declare?

339
00:27:38,797 --> 00:27:41,254
As a matter of fact, yes.

340
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:42,956
Hola.

341
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:55,431
Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos.
Please report to Level Seven.

342
00:28:05,073 --> 00:28:06,734
I miss my nose.

343
00:28:16,168 --> 00:28:19,752
Come on, help us out, amigo. We got
to get to a dozen ofrendas tonight.

344
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:23,330
We are not visiting your ex-wife's family
for Dia de Muertos!

345
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:26,215
I demand to speak to
the person in charge!

346
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:29,010
I'm sorry, seﬁora,
it says here no one put up your photo.

347
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:33,515
My family always puts my photo
on the ofrenda.

348
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:36,643
That devil box tells you nothing but lies!

349
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:41,352
-Mama Imelda?
-Oh, mi familial

350
00:28:41,526 --> 00:28:43,016
They wouldn't let me cross the bridge.

351
00:28:43,195 --> 00:28:48,155
Tell this woman and her devil box
that my photo is on the ofrenda.

352
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:51,488
Well, we never made it to the ofrenda.

353
00:28:51,662 --> 00:28:53,493
-What?
-We ran into...

354
00:28:58,543 --> 00:29:01,080
-Miguel?
-Mama Imelda.

355
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:03,707
What is going on?

356
00:29:03,882 --> 00:29:05,543
You the Rivera family?

357
00:29:07,803 --> 00:29:10,385
-Well, you're cursed.
-What?

358
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:14,340
Dla de los Muertos is the night to give
to the dead. You stole from the dead!

359
00:29:14,476 --> 00:29:16,808
-But I wasn't stealing the guitar.
-Guitar?

360
00:29:16,895 --> 00:29:20,353
It was my great-great-grandfather's.
He would have wanted me to have it.

361
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,774
We do not speak of that musician.
He is dead to this family.

362
00:29:24,861 --> 00:29:26,852
You're all dead.

363
00:29:27,906 --> 00:29:30,443
I am sorry. Whose alebrije is that?

364
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:31,649
That's just Dante.

365
00:29:31,743 --> 00:29:33,779
He sure doesn't look like an alebrije.

366
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,406
He just looks like a plain old dog.

367
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:37,495
Or a sausage someone dropped
in a barbershop.

368
00:29:37,582 --> 00:29:41,325
Whatever he is, I am terribly allergic.

369
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,160
But Dante doesn't have any hair.

370
00:29:43,255 --> 00:29:45,621
And I don't have a nose,
and yet, here we are.

371
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:50,838
But none of this explains why
I couldn't cross over.

372
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:51,918
Oh!

373
00:29:53,932 --> 00:29:56,548
You took my photo off the ofrenda?

374
00:29:56,643 --> 00:29:58,804
-It was an accident!
-How do we send him back?

375
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:01,473
Well, since it's a family matter...

376
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:05,774
the way to undo a family curse
is to get your family's blessing.

377
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:06,475
That's it?

378
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:10,695
Get your family's blessing and
everything should go back to normal.

379
00:30:10,782 --> 00:30:12,522
But you got to do it by sunrise.

380
00:30:12,617 --> 00:30:14,357
What happens at sunrise?

381
00:30:14,494 --> 00:30:16,450
Hijolel Your hand!

382
00:30:21,835 --> 00:30:24,451
Whoa, Miguel,
can't have you fainting on us.

383
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:29,127
But not to worry. Your family's here.
You can get your blessing right now.

384
00:30:29,301 --> 00:30:34,216
Cempasuchil, cempasuchil.
Aha! Perdon, seriora.

385
00:30:35,682 --> 00:30:37,968
Now, you look at the living
and say his name.

386
00:30:39,102 --> 00:30:39,932
Miguel.

387
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,353
Nailed it.
Now say, "I give you my blessing."

388
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,647
I give you my blessing.

389
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:50,777
I give you my blessing to go home...

390
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:56,241
to put my photo back on the ofrenda,
and to never play music again.

391
00:30:56,328 --> 00:30:58,535
What? She can't do that!

392
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:01,455
Well, technically,
she can add any condition she wants.

393
00:31:03,126 --> 00:31:06,414
-Fine.
-Then you hand the petal to Miguel.

394
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:19,722
No skeletons!

395
00:31:24,356 --> 00:31:26,472
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.

396
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:32,898
Two seconds
and you already break your promise.

397
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:36,026
This isn't fair. It's my life.
You already had yours.

398
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:38,818
Papa Julio, I ask for your blessing.

399
00:31:39,496 --> 00:31:41,862
Tia Rosita? Oscar?

400
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:44,747
Felipe? Tia Victoria?

401
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:48,835
Don't make this hard, mr'jo.
You go home my way or no way.

402
00:31:48,922 --> 00:31:50,958
You really hate music that much?

403
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:53,665
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.

404
00:31:58,765 --> 00:32:00,801
The same path he did. He's family.

405
00:32:00,892 --> 00:32:03,759
-Listen to your Mama Imelda.
-She's just looking out for you.

406
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:04,843
Be reasonable.

407
00:32:04,938 --> 00:32:09,898
Con permiso, I need to visit
the restroom. Be right back.

408
00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:14,186
Should we tell him there are no
restrooms in the Land of the Dead?

409
00:32:27,627 --> 00:32:28,662
Vamonos.

410
00:32:28,753 --> 00:32:31,210
We got a family looking for a living boy.

411
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:33,789
If I want to be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.

412
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:35,832
We got to find my great-great-grandpa.

413
00:32:35,927 --> 00:32:37,258
Hold it, muchacho.

414
00:32:41,474 --> 00:32:45,217
I found that living boy! Oh, whoa,
excuse me. Excuse me, folks.

415
00:32:45,353 --> 00:32:46,388
Excuse me.

416
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:54,192
No, no. Dante!

417
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:59,615
Disturbing the peace.
Fleeing an officer. Falsifying a unibrow.

418
00:32:59,784 --> 00:33:01,945
-That's illegal?
-Very illegal.

419
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,111
You need to clean up your act, amigo.

420
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:09,500
Amigo? Oh, that's so nice to hear you
say that because I have just had a...

421
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:13,787
really hard Dla de Muertos and
I could really use an amigo right now.

422
00:33:13,965 --> 00:33:16,377
And amigos, they help their amigos.

423
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:20,468
You get me across that bridge tonight,
and I'll make it worth your while.

424
00:33:20,597 --> 00:33:23,339
Oh! You like de la Cruz?
He and I go way back.

425
00:33:23,475 --> 00:33:27,138
I can get you front row seats
to his Sunrise Spectacular show.

426
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,181
I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.

427
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:30,929
You just got to let me cross that bridge!

428
00:33:31,107 --> 00:33:33,143
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.

429
00:33:33,568 --> 00:33:37,356
But my shift's almost up
and I want to visit my living family.

430
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:39,654
So I'm letting you off with a warning.

431
00:33:41,034 --> 00:33:44,777
-Can I at least get my costume back?
-No.

432
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,821
Some amigo.

433
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:53,334
Hey! Hey! You really know de la Cruz?

434
00:33:53,505 --> 00:33:55,837
Who wants to-- Ay! You're alive!

435
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:59,587
Sh! Yeah, I'm alive. And if I want to
get back to the Land of the Living...

436
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:01,129
I need de la Cruz's blessing.

437
00:34:01,304 --> 00:34:02,635
That's weirdly specific.

438
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:04,546
He's my great—great—grandfather.

439
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:06,677
He's your Gr-- What?

440
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:11,887
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

441
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,016
Wait. No, wait, wait, wait.

442
00:34:16,194 --> 00:34:20,187
Wait! Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!

443
00:34:20,323 --> 00:34:22,188
You know what?
Maybe this isn't such a good--

444
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:24,699
No, no, nir”ro! Niﬁo, niﬁo, I can help you.
You can help me.

445
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:27,781
We can help each other.
But most importantly, you can help me.

446
00:34:27,872 --> 00:34:29,487
-Miguel!
-I'm Hector.

447
00:34:29,624 --> 00:34:30,488
That's nice.

448
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:37,082
Espérame, chamaco!

449
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:50,510
Ay, he is going to get himself killed.
I need my spirit guide... Pepita.

450
00:35:03,116 --> 00:35:05,027
Who has that petal Miguel touched?

451
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:07,943
Here. Nice alebrije.

452
00:35:20,925 --> 00:35:25,464
Ay, ay, hold still. Look up. A ver, a ver.
Look up, up, up.

453
00:35:27,098 --> 00:35:31,888
Aqui arriba, eso... Eh, la rayita.

454
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:34,428
Okay. Hey! Ta-da!

455
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,805
Dead as a doorknob.

456
00:35:38,151 --> 00:35:41,109
So listen, Miguel,
this place runs on memories.

457
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:44,271
When you're well remembered, people
put up your photo and you get to...

458
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:48,317
cross the bridge and visit the living
on Dia de Muertos. Unless you're me.

459
00:35:48,495 --> 00:35:50,076
You don't get to cross over?

460
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:52,953
No one's ever put up my picture.
But you can change that!

461
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,206
This is you?

462
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:56,658
Eh, muy guapo, eh?

463
00:35:56,836 --> 00:35:59,794
So, you get me to my
great-great-grandpa. ..

464
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:02,671
then I put up your photo
when I get home?

465
00:36:02,842 --> 00:36:06,505
Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes!
One hiccup.

466
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:10,171
Dela Cruz is a tough guy to get to
and I need to cross the bridge soon.

467
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,137
Like, tonight. So, you got
any other family here, you know?

468
00:36:13,311 --> 00:36:15,393
Someone a bit more accessible?

469
00:36:15,522 --> 00:36:17,262
Mm... Nope.

470
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:20,106
Don't yank my chain, chamaco.
You got to have some other family.

471
00:36:20,193 --> 00:36:23,606
Only de la Cruz. Ifyou can't help me,
I'll find him myself.

472
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:28,941
Oh! Okay. Okay, kid. Fine! Fine!
I'll get you to your great-great-grandpa.

473
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:35,539
It's not gonna be easy, you know?
He's a busy man. What are you doing?

474
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:38,165
I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in.

475
00:36:38,336 --> 00:36:39,872
No. Skeletons don't walk like that.

476
00:36:40,046 --> 00:36:43,504
-It's how you walk.
-No, Idon't! Stop it!

477
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:49,169
Whoa! Ernesto de la Cruz's
Sunrise Spectacular? Qué padre!

478
00:36:49,806 --> 00:36:52,843
Every year your great-great-grandpa
puts on that dumb show...

479
00:36:53,017 --> 00:36:54,348
to mark the end of Dia de Muertos.

480
00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:56,100
And you can get us in!

481
00:36:57,355 --> 00:36:59,266
Hey, you said you have
front row tickets!

482
00:36:59,357 --> 00:37:02,144
That...was a lie. I apologize for that.

483
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:04,810
Cool off, chamaco.
Come on. I'll get you to him.

484
00:37:04,988 --> 00:37:05,693
How?

485
00:37:05,864 --> 00:37:07,695
Because I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.

486
00:37:18,585 --> 00:37:22,453
Remember me
Don't let it make you cry

487
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,001
You better have my dress, Héctor.

488
00:37:26,176 --> 00:37:27,256
Hola, Ceci.

489
00:37:33,433 --> 00:37:37,927
-Hola.
-Ceci, I lost the dress.

490
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:39,097
Ya Io sabia!

491
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,562
I got to dress forty dancers by sunrise.

492
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:45,066
Thanks to you, I'm one Frida
short of an opening number!

493
00:37:45,612 --> 00:37:49,321
Dante! We shouldn't be in here.

494
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:06,583
No, no, Dante! Ven aca!

495
00:38:15,433 --> 00:38:17,469
You! How did you get in here?

496
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,724
-I just followed my--
-Oh! The mighty Xolo dog!

497
00:38:21,856 --> 00:38:27,647
Guider of wandering spirits. And
whose spirit have you guided to me?

498
00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:30,111
I don't think he's a spirit guide.

499
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:34,028
The alebrijes of this world
can take many forms.

500
00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:37,076
They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.

501
00:38:42,961 --> 00:38:46,453
Or maybe he's just a dog.
Come, I need your eyes.

502
00:38:48,091 --> 00:38:51,675
You are the audience. Darkness.

503
00:38:52,303 --> 00:38:56,171
And from the darkness, a giant papaya.

504
00:38:57,517 --> 00:39:03,638
Dancers emerge from the papaya,
and the dancers are all me.

505
00:39:04,566 --> 00:39:08,309
And they go to drink from the milk
of their mother, who is a cactus.

506
00:39:08,528 --> 00:39:14,194
But who is also me.
And her milk is not milk but tears.

507
00:39:15,535 --> 00:39:16,615
Is it too obvious?

508
00:39:16,744 --> 00:39:20,157
I think it's just
the right amount of obvious?

509
00:39:20,331 --> 00:39:23,539
It could use some music.
Oh, what if you did like...

510
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:28,502
Oh! And then it could go...

511
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,176
And what if everything was on fire?

512
00:39:37,015 --> 00:39:39,051
Yes! Fire! Everywhere!

513
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:43,473
Inspired!
You have the spirit of an artist.

514
00:39:45,398 --> 00:39:48,140
The dancers exit.
The music fades, the lights go out.

515
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:51,526
And Ernesto de la Cruz
rises to the stage!

516
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:56,652
Huh?

517
00:39:56,784 --> 00:39:58,900
He does a couple of songs,
the sun rises, everyone cheers--

518
00:39:59,037 --> 00:40:01,528
Excuse me,
where's the real de la Cruz?

519
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:03,697
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals!

520
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:07,333
He's too busy hosting that fancy party
at the top of his tower.

521
00:40:11,215 --> 00:40:15,049
Chamaco, you can't run off on me
like that. Stop pestering the celebrities.

522
00:40:15,178 --> 00:40:17,089
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here!

523
00:40:17,263 --> 00:40:19,925
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.

524
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,511
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?

525
00:40:22,602 --> 00:40:25,344
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?

526
00:40:25,521 --> 00:40:28,228
He's your great-great-grandpa,
how come he didn't invite you?

527
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:31,391
Hey, Gustavo!
You know anything about this party?

528
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:32,812
It's the hot ticket!

529
00:40:32,904 --> 00:40:36,772
But if you're not on the guest list,
you're never getting in, Chorizo.

530
00:40:36,949 --> 00:40:39,190
Hey! It's Chorizo! Choricito!

531
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:42,660
-A-ha. Very funny, guys. Very funny.
-Chorizo?

532
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:46,782
Oh, this guy's famous!
Go on, go on. Ask him how he died.

533
00:40:46,918 --> 00:40:48,249
I don't want to talk about it.

534
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:51,161
He choked on some chorizo!

535
00:40:53,758 --> 00:40:57,250
I didn't choke, okay? I got food
poisoning which is a big difference.

536
00:40:58,596 --> 00:41:01,759
This is why I don't like musicians.
Bunch of self-important jerks.

537
00:41:01,891 --> 00:41:04,507
-Hey! I'm a musician!
-You are?

538
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:08,512
If you really want to get to Ernesto,
there is that music competition...

539
00:41:08,606 --> 00:41:12,474
at the Plaza de la Cruz.
Winner gets to play at his party.

540
00:41:13,778 --> 00:41:16,736
No, no. Chamaco,
you're loco if you think--

541
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:18,897
I need to get
my great-great-grandfather's blessing!

542
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:20,781
You know where I can get a guitar?

543
00:41:22,787 --> 00:41:24,618
I know a guy.

544
00:41:36,467 --> 00:41:39,425
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?

545
00:41:40,471 --> 00:41:43,133
-A footprint!
-It's a Rivera boot.

546
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:45,382
-Size seven!
-And a half.

547
00:41:45,476 --> 00:41:47,137
-Pronated.
-Miguel.

548
00:41:57,488 --> 00:41:59,194
Why the heck
would you want to be a musician?

549
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:01,398
My great-great-grandpa
was a musician!

550
00:42:01,534 --> 00:42:05,243
Who spent his life performing like
a monkey for complete strangers.

551
00:42:05,371 --> 00:42:06,952
No thank you. No! Guacalal

552
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,998
What do you know?
So, how far is this guitar anyway?

553
00:42:11,169 --> 00:42:12,033
We're almost there.

554
00:42:17,383 --> 00:42:18,714
Keep up, chamaco. Come on.

555
00:42:27,685 --> 00:42:32,179
-Cousin Héctor!
-Hey! These guys! Hey, Tio!

556
00:42:32,356 --> 00:42:35,018
-5‘ Que onda?
-These people are all your family?

557
00:42:36,235 --> 00:42:39,523
In a way. We're all the ones
with no photos or ofrendas.

558
00:42:39,697 --> 00:42:42,313
No family to go home to.
Nearly forgotten, you know?

559
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:47,110
So, we all call each other cousin,
or tio, or whatever.

560
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,582
-Héctor!
-Tia Chelo!

561
00:42:55,463 --> 00:42:57,374
Muchas gracias!

562
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,047
Hey! Save some for me!
Is Chicharrén around?

563
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:04,002
Eh, in the bungalow. Idon't know
if he's in the mood for visitors.

564
00:43:04,138 --> 00:43:07,096
Who doesn't like
a visit from Cousin Hector?

565
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,061
Buenas noches, Chicharrén!

566
00:43:18,236 --> 00:43:20,693
I don't want to see
your stupid face, Héctor.

567
00:43:20,822 --> 00:43:24,235
Come on. It's Dia de Muertos.
I brought you a little offering.

568
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:25,948
-Get out of here.
-I would, Cheech.

569
00:43:26,577 --> 00:43:28,989
But the thing is,
me and my friend, Miguel...

570
00:43:30,164 --> 00:43:31,950
We really need to borrow your guitar.

571
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,698
-My guitar?
-Yes.

572
00:43:33,835 --> 00:43:37,578
-My prized beloved guitar?
-I promise we'll bring it right back.

573
00:43:37,755 --> 00:43:41,623
Like the time you promised to bring
back my van? Or my mini-fridge?

574
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:43,499
-Ah, you see-—
-Or my good napkins?

575
00:43:43,594 --> 00:43:45,209
My lasso? My femur?

576
00:43:45,388 --> 00:43:47,879
-Well, no, not like those times.
-Where is my femur? You——

577
00:43:51,018 --> 00:43:54,510
-You okay, amigo?
-I'm fading, Héctor.

578
00:43:55,439 --> 00:44:00,979
I can feel it. I couldn't even play
that thing if I wanted to.

579
00:44:04,282 --> 00:44:06,443
You play me something.

580
00:44:06,617 --> 00:44:10,280
No. You know I don't play anymore,
Cheech. The guitar is for the kid.

581
00:44:10,913 --> 00:44:14,280
You want it, you got to earn it.

582
00:44:16,127 --> 00:44:18,618
Ay, only for you, amigo.

583
00:44:21,465 --> 00:44:22,796
An)’ requests?

584
00:44:24,135 --> 00:44:26,626
You know my favorite, Héctor.

585
00:44:44,363 --> 00:44:47,605
Well, everyone knows Juanita

586
00:44:49,493 --> 00:44:52,485
Her eyes each a different color

587
00:44:54,332 --> 00:44:58,792
Her teeth stick out
And her chin goes in

588
00:45:00,129 --> 00:45:02,336
And her...

589
00:45:03,466 --> 00:45:06,503
Knuckles they drag on the ﬂoor

590
00:45:06,844 --> 00:45:09,176
-Those aren't the words.
-There are children present.

591
00:45:09,347 --> 00:45:12,885
Her hair is like a briar

592
00:45:14,226 --> 00:45:17,844
She stands in a bow—legged stance

593
00:45:19,857 --> 00:45:23,850
And if I weren't so ugly

594
00:45:25,863 --> 00:45:31,074
She'd possibly give me a chance

595
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:39,369
Brings back memories.

596
00:45:43,923 --> 00:45:45,538
Gracias.

597
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:18,529
Wait. What happened?

598
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:20,573
He's been forgotten.

599
00:46:21,252 --> 00:46:23,959
When there's no one left in
the living world who remembers you...

600
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:29,090
you disappear from this world.
We call it the final death.

601
00:46:29,802 --> 00:46:31,884
Where did he go?

602
00:46:32,054 --> 00:46:33,385
No one knows.

603
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:37,219
But I've met him.
I could remember him when I go back!

604
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:38,974
No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco.

605
00:46:39,812 --> 00:46:44,431
Our memories, they have to be passed
down by those who knew us in life...

606
00:46:44,608 --> 00:46:47,099
in the stories they tell about us.

607
00:46:48,154 --> 00:46:50,816
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Cheech's stories.

608
00:46:53,617 --> 00:46:55,653
Hey, it happens to everyone eventually.

609
00:46:55,828 --> 00:46:58,444
Come on, de la Cruzcito,
you've got a contest to win.

610
00:47:11,093 --> 00:47:14,585
You told me you hated musicians.
You never said you were one.

611
00:47:14,764 --> 00:47:16,629
How do you think
I knew your great-great-grandpa?

612
00:47:16,807 --> 00:47:19,389
We used to play music together.
Taught him everything he knows.

613
00:47:20,061 --> 00:47:23,224
No manches!
You played with Ernesto de la Cruz...

614
00:47:23,397 --> 00:47:25,103
the greatest musician of all time?

615
00:47:25,274 --> 00:47:28,812
Ah, you're funny.
Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe.

616
00:47:28,986 --> 00:47:30,647
But his music? Eh, not so much.

617
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,611
You don't know
what you're talking about.

618
00:47:46,337 --> 00:47:48,919
Llévelol T-shirts! Bobbleheadsl

619
00:47:55,721 --> 00:47:59,054
Bien venidos a todos!

620
00:48:06,107 --> 00:48:08,473
It's a battle of the bands, amigos.

621
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:13,853
The winner gets to play for the maestro
himself, Ernesto de la Cruz...

622
00:48:14,031 --> 00:48:16,363
at his ﬁesta tonight!

623
00:48:16,784 --> 00:48:18,320
That's our ticket, muchacho.

624
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:23,162
Let the competition begin!

625
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:41,801
So, what's the plan?
What are you gonna play?

626
00:48:41,976 --> 00:48:43,307
Definitely Remember Me.

627
00:48:43,477 --> 00:48:46,640
-No! Not that one. No.
-Come on. It's his most popular song!

628
00:48:46,814 --> 00:48:48,054
It's too popular.

629
00:48:48,232 --> 00:48:50,143
Remember me
Though I have to travel far

630
00:48:50,317 --> 00:48:53,400
-Remember me...
-Don't let it make you cry...

631
00:48:58,075 --> 00:49:01,408
-What about Poco Loco?
-Epa! Now that's a song!

632
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:05,071
De la Cruzcito? You're on standby.
Los Chachalacos, you're up next.

633
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,411
Los Chachalacos!

634
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,511
You always this nervous
before a performance?

635
00:49:21,682 --> 00:49:24,674
I don't know.
I've never performed before.

636
00:49:24,852 --> 00:49:26,808
What? You said you were a musician!

637
00:49:26,896 --> 00:49:28,477
lam! I mean, Iwill be.

638
00:49:28,606 --> 00:49:29,937
-Ay!
-Once I win.

639
00:49:30,274 --> 00:49:34,267
That's your plan? No. You have to win.
Your life literally depends on...

640
00:49:34,445 --> 00:49:36,936
you winning. And you've never
done this before! I'll go up there.

641
00:49:37,114 --> 00:49:39,355
-No! I need to do this.
-Why?

642
00:49:39,533 --> 00:49:43,572
If I can't go out and play one song,
how can I call myself a musician?

643
00:49:43,746 --> 00:49:44,701
What does that matter?

644
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,912
Because I don'tjust want to get
de la Cruz's blessing...

645
00:49:47,124 --> 00:49:50,958
I need to prove that I'm worthy of it.

646
00:49:51,712 --> 00:49:56,331
Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment
at such a bad time!

647
00:49:59,303 --> 00:50:02,921
Okay! Okay. You want to perform?
Then you got to perform!

648
00:50:03,057 --> 00:50:06,140
First, you have to loosen up.
Shake off those nerves.

649
00:50:10,648 --> 00:50:12,104
Now give me your best grito.

650
00:50:12,191 --> 00:50:14,728
-My best grito?
-Come on, yell! Belt it out.

651
00:50:17,947 --> 00:50:21,030
Ah, it feels good. Okay, now you.

652
00:50:26,497 --> 00:50:28,158
Oh, come on, kid.

653
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:40,749
De la Cruzcito, you're on now!

654
00:50:40,844 --> 00:50:44,587
Miguel, look at me. Hey, look at me.
You can do this.

655
00:50:44,682 --> 00:50:46,513
Grab their attention and don't let it go.

656
00:50:47,101 --> 00:50:49,183
Make them listen, chamaco.
You've got this.

657
00:50:49,353 --> 00:50:51,469
De la Cruzcito!

658
00:51:00,364 --> 00:51:02,355
What's he doing? Why isn't he playing?

659
00:51:03,117 --> 00:51:05,358
Bring back the singing dogs!

660
00:51:17,131 --> 00:51:19,918
Que bien! Vamonos! Whoo!

661
00:51:28,017 --> 00:51:31,509
What color is the sky?
A y mi amor, ay mi amor

662
00:51:31,687 --> 00:51:35,305
You tell me that it's red
A y mi amor, ay mi amor

663
00:51:35,482 --> 00:51:38,849
Where should I put my shoes?
A y mi amor, ay mi amor

664
00:51:38,986 --> 00:51:43,821
You say put them on your head
A y mi amor, ay mi amor

665
00:51:43,949 --> 00:51:48,409
You make me un poco loco
Un poqui-ti-ti-to loco

666
00:51:48,746 --> 00:51:51,783
The way you keep me guessing
I'm nodding and I'm yes-ing

667
00:51:52,374 --> 00:51:54,831
I'll count it as a blessing

668
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,873
That I'm only un poco loco

669
00:52:00,424 --> 00:52:01,914
No! No! No!

670
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:12,592
-Not bad for a dead guy!
-Not so bad yourself, gordito! Eso!

671
00:52:19,943 --> 00:52:21,479
He's close! Find him!

672
00:52:21,612 --> 00:52:25,275
The loco that you make me
It is just un poco crazy

673
00:52:25,574 --> 00:52:27,235
The sense that you're not making

674
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:29,274
The liberties you're taking

675
00:52:29,411 --> 00:52:35,372
Leaves my cabeza shaking
You're just un poco loco

676
00:52:44,885 --> 00:52:47,501
-We're looking for a living kid.
-About twelve?

677
00:52:47,638 --> 00:52:49,378
Have you seen a living boy?

678
00:52:50,307 --> 00:52:55,643
Un poqui-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-to
loco

679
00:53:03,779 --> 00:53:08,614
Hey! You did good!
I'm proud of you. Eso!

680
00:53:09,618 --> 00:53:12,655
Otra! Otra! Otra!

681
00:53:18,127 --> 00:53:20,334
-Hey! Where are you going?
-We got to get out of here!

682
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:22,628
What? Are you crazy?
We're about to win this thing.

683
00:53:24,007 --> 00:53:27,499
Damas y cabal/eros,
I have an emergency announcement.

684
00:53:27,678 --> 00:53:33,014
Please be on the lookout for a living
boy. Answers to the name of Miguel.

685
00:53:33,183 --> 00:53:36,675
Earlier tonight
he ran away from his family.

686
00:53:36,812 --> 00:53:39,519
Theyjust want to send him back
to the Land of the Living.

687
00:53:39,648 --> 00:53:42,765
Wait, wait. You said de la Cruz
was your only family.

688
00:53:42,943 --> 00:53:44,683
The only person
who could send you home.

689
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,941
You could have taken my photo back
this whole time?

690
00:53:48,073 --> 00:53:50,940
But they hate music!
I need a musician's blessing.

691
00:53:51,034 --> 00:53:53,025
-You lied to me!
-You're one to talk.

692
00:53:53,162 --> 00:53:55,448
Look at me. I'm being forgotten, Miguel.

693
00:53:55,539 --> 00:53:57,325
I don't even know
if I'm gonna last the night.

694
00:53:57,499 --> 00:54:00,036
I'm not gonna miss my one chance
to cross that bridge because...

695
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,952
you want to live out
some stupid musical fantasy.

696
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,291
-It's not stupid!
-I'm taking you to your family.

697
00:54:05,466 --> 00:54:06,876
-Let go of me!
-You'll thank me later.

698
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:09,462
You don't want to help me.
You only care about yourself!

699
00:54:10,137 --> 00:54:13,049
Keep your dumb photo.
Stay away from me!

700
00:54:13,223 --> 00:54:14,212
No!

701
00:54:15,893 --> 00:54:18,680
Hey, chamaco! Where did you go?

702
00:54:20,063 --> 00:54:23,430
Chamaco! I'm sorry! Come back!

703
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:37,824
Dante, callate! No! Dante, stop it.

704
00:54:37,998 --> 00:54:42,742
He can't help me. Dante! Stop!

705
00:54:42,878 --> 00:54:44,789
Stop it! Leave me alone!

706
00:54:45,255 --> 00:54:49,373
You're not a spirit guide. You're just
a dumb dog! Now get out of here!

707
00:54:49,676 --> 00:54:52,258
-It's him!
—|t's that living boy!

708
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:53,919
-I heard about him. Look!
-He's alive!

709
00:54:54,056 --> 00:54:55,421
-He's alive.
-The boy is alive!

710
00:55:05,943 --> 00:55:08,355
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!

711
00:55:08,529 --> 00:55:11,191
I am giving you my blessing
and you are going home.

712
00:55:11,365 --> 00:55:12,775
I don't want your blessing!

713
00:55:14,117 --> 00:55:15,948
Miguel, stop!

714
00:55:17,955 --> 00:55:21,914
Come back! Miguel!

715
00:55:26,797 --> 00:55:28,537
I am trying to save your life!

716
00:55:28,674 --> 00:55:30,630
-You're ruining my life!
-What?

717
00:55:30,926 --> 00:55:35,295
Music's the only thing that makes me
happy. And you want to take it away.

718
00:55:35,889 --> 00:55:37,629
You'll never understand.

719
00:55:40,894 --> 00:55:45,558
Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona

720
00:55:45,732 --> 00:55:49,475
No dejaré de quererte...

721
00:55:50,988 --> 00:55:52,649
I thought you hated music.

722
00:55:52,781 --> 00:55:57,775
I loved it! I remember that feeling...

723
00:55:58,495 --> 00:56:04,491
when my husband would play, and
I would sing and nothing else mattered.

724
00:56:05,919 --> 00:56:10,663
But when we had Coco, suddenly
there was something in my life that...

725
00:56:10,841 --> 00:56:15,926
mattered more than music.
I wanted to put down roots.

726
00:56:16,972 --> 00:56:19,634
He wanted to play for the world.

727
00:56:20,976 --> 00:56:24,184
We each made a sacrifice
to get what we wanted.

728
00:56:24,354 --> 00:56:26,595
Now you must make a choice.

729
00:56:26,773 --> 00:56:29,515
But I don't want to pick sides!

730
00:56:29,693 --> 00:56:34,027
Why can't you be on my side?
That's what family's supposed to do.

731
00:56:34,197 --> 00:56:38,816
Support you. But you never will.

732
00:56:58,388 --> 00:57:00,800
-Have a good time.
-Oh, how exciting!

733
00:57:02,476 --> 00:57:07,061
Oh, El Santo. I'm a big fan!
You mind if I...

734
00:57:12,235 --> 00:57:14,066
Gracias, Senor.

735
00:57:17,574 --> 00:57:19,360
-Invitation?
-It's okay.

736
00:57:19,534 --> 00:57:21,399
I'm Ernesto's great-great-grandson.

737
00:57:33,006 --> 00:57:36,248
-Discu/pen, seﬁores...
-Hey, guys! It's poco loco!

738
00:57:36,426 --> 00:57:38,758
-You were on fire tonight!
-You too!

739
00:57:38,929 --> 00:57:42,421
Hey, musician to musician...
I need a favor.

740
00:57:45,102 --> 00:57:48,765
The competition winners.
Congratulations, chicos.

741
00:57:59,574 --> 00:58:00,609
Thanks, guys!

742
00:58:13,213 --> 00:58:16,250
-Hey! Enjoy the party, little musico!
-Gracias!

743
00:58:20,804 --> 00:58:21,509
Oh!

744
00:58:31,606 --> 00:58:33,312
Look! It's Ernesto!

745
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:36,023
De la Cruz!

746
00:58:37,487 --> 00:58:38,943
Seﬁor de la Cruz!

747
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:45,112
Pardon me!
Senor de la Cruz! Senor de la--

748
00:58:50,667 --> 00:58:53,659
When you see your moment,
you mustn't let it pass you by.

749
00:58:53,837 --> 00:58:55,498
You must seize it.

750
00:58:55,672 --> 00:58:57,663
This one has a wise spirit.

751
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:14,187
We're almost there, Dante.

752
00:59:18,195 --> 00:59:20,811
Senor de la Cruz! Senor de la--

753
00:59:26,703 --> 00:59:29,115
But what can we do? It is hopeless...

754
00:59:29,206 --> 00:59:32,869
-You must have faith, sister.
-But Padre, he will never listen.

755
00:59:33,043 --> 00:59:35,580
He will listen... to music.

756
01:00:00,195 --> 01:00:04,689
Senoras y senores, buenas tardes,
buenas noches

757
01:00:04,825 --> 01:00:08,613
Buenas tardes, buenas noches
Senoritas y senores

758
01:00:08,745 --> 01:00:13,079
To be here with you tonight
Brings me joy! Qué alegrla

759
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:17,869
For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia

760
01:00:19,256 --> 01:00:23,920
For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia

761
01:00:25,262 --> 01:00:30,677
For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia

762
01:00:30,851 --> 01:00:32,466
For this music is my lang--

763
01:00:44,948 --> 01:00:46,438
Are you all right, nino?

764
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:55,614
It's you! You are that boy! The one
who came from the Land of the Living.

765
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:57,748
You...know about me?

766
01:00:57,878 --> 01:01:02,622
You are all anyone has been talking
about. Why have you come here?

767
01:01:03,425 --> 01:01:07,589
I'm Miguel. Your great-great-grandson.

768
01:01:08,972 --> 01:01:11,463
I... have a great-great-grandson?

769
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:15,388
I need your blessing so I can go
back home and be a musician.

770
01:01:15,478 --> 01:01:20,393
Just like you. The rest of our family,
they wouldn't listen.

771
01:01:21,067 --> 01:01:23,729
But I hoped you would.

772
01:01:25,739 --> 01:01:30,278
My boy, with a talent like yours,
how could I not listen?

773
01:01:33,455 --> 01:01:35,741
I have a great-great-grandson!

774
01:01:42,505 --> 01:01:45,747
-Look! It's Frida!
-Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo.

775
01:01:46,134 --> 01:01:48,967
-It is an honor, Senora.
-Gracias.

776
01:01:53,183 --> 01:01:56,846
Hey, Negrete! Infantel Have you
met my great-great-grandson?

777
01:01:57,437 --> 01:01:59,098
My great-great-grandson.

778
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:01,516
He's alive! And a musician to boot!

779
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:03,515
Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple.

780
01:02:03,652 --> 01:02:04,687
No dimple!

781
01:02:04,819 --> 01:02:06,104
To our friendship.

782
01:02:06,237 --> 01:02:10,196
Iwould move Heaven and Earth
for you, mi amigo. Saludl

783
01:02:11,618 --> 01:02:13,028
Poison!

784
01:02:13,203 --> 01:02:15,319
You know, I did all my own stunts.

785
01:02:15,455 --> 01:02:19,118
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me...

786
01:02:21,211 --> 01:02:24,499
All of this came from my amazing fans
in the Land of the Living.

787
01:02:26,299 --> 01:02:29,666
They leave me more offerings
than I know what to do with!

788
01:02:30,387 --> 01:02:33,675
Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed.

789
01:02:33,848 --> 01:02:37,056
-No! It's all great!
-But?

790
01:02:37,185 --> 01:02:41,303
It's just-- I have been looking up to you
my whole life.

791
01:02:42,107 --> 01:02:45,190
You're the guy who actually did it!

792
01:02:45,986 --> 01:02:51,652
But did you ever regret it?
Choosing music over everything else?

793
01:02:52,701 --> 01:02:57,946
It was hard. Saying goodbye to
my hometown. Heading off on my own...

794
01:02:59,374 --> 01:03:00,409
Leaving your family?

795
01:03:06,256 --> 01:03:09,089
One cannot deny
who one is meant to be.

796
01:03:09,759 --> 01:03:13,877
And you, my great-great-grandson,
are meant to be a musician!

797
01:03:16,433 --> 01:03:20,927
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.
We cannot belong to one family.

798
01:03:21,187 --> 01:03:23,428
The world is our family.

799
01:03:25,066 --> 01:03:27,682
The fireworks have begun!

800
01:03:38,288 --> 01:03:41,780
Soon the party will move across town
for my Sunrise Spectacular.

801
01:03:43,084 --> 01:03:47,453
Miguel, you must come to the show!
You will be my guest of honor!

802
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,712
-You mean it?
-Of course, my boy.

803
01:03:52,385 --> 01:03:56,378
I can't.
I have to get home before sunrise.

804
01:03:56,556 --> 01:03:58,547
Oh! I really do need to get you home.

805
01:04:02,979 --> 01:04:07,473
It has been an honor.
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.

806
01:04:08,276 --> 01:04:09,641
I hope you die very soon.

807
01:04:12,447 --> 01:04:13,857
You know what I mean.

808
01:04:16,409 --> 01:04:20,618
-Miguel, I give you my b|ess--
-We had a deal, chamaco.

809
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,989
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?

810
01:04:25,168 --> 01:04:27,159
Frida! I thought you couldn't make it.

811
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:31,004
You said you'd take back my photo.
You promised, Miguel.

812
01:04:31,132 --> 01:04:32,997
You know this man?

813
01:04:33,176 --> 01:04:36,384
Ijust met him tonight.
He told me he knew you.

814
01:04:37,305 --> 01:04:38,920
Héctor?

815
01:04:39,516 --> 01:04:42,428
Please, Miguel. Put my photo up.

816
01:04:44,145 --> 01:04:47,979
My friend, you're being forgotten.

817
01:04:48,066 --> 01:04:50,352
-And whose fault is that?
-Héctor, please...

818
01:04:50,443 --> 01:04:53,230
Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.

819
01:04:53,363 --> 01:04:54,102
What?

820
01:04:54,197 --> 01:04:57,360
If I'm being forgotten, it's because
you never told anyone that I wrote them!

821
01:04:57,492 --> 01:05:00,575
That's crazy!
De la Cruz wrote all his own songs.

822
01:05:00,954 --> 01:05:02,819
You want to tell him or should I?

823
01:05:02,956 --> 01:05:08,701
Héctor, I never meant to take credit.
We made a great team, but you died...

824
01:05:08,795 --> 01:05:13,710
and I only sang your songs because
I wanted to keep a part of you alive.

825
01:05:13,883 --> 01:05:15,339
How generous!

826
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,626
You really did play together.

827
01:05:17,804 --> 01:05:21,843
I don't want to fight about it.
Ijust want you to make it right.

828
01:05:22,016 --> 01:05:25,679
Miguel can put my photo up,
and I can cross over the bridge.

829
01:05:26,479 --> 01:05:31,269
I can see my girl.
Ernesto, remember the night I left?

830
01:05:31,401 --> 01:05:32,766
That was a long time ago.

831
01:05:32,902 --> 01:05:36,235
We drank together and you told me
you would move Heaven and Earth...

832
01:05:36,406 --> 01:05:40,194
for your amigo.
Well, I'm asking you to now.

833
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,867
Heaven and Earth’? Like in the movie?

834
01:05:42,996 --> 01:05:45,453
-What?
-That's Don Hida|go's toast.

835
01:05:45,874 --> 01:05:47,865
In the de la Cruz movie,
El Camino a Casa.

836
01:05:48,001 --> 01:05:51,835
-I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.
-No! It's in there. Look!

837
01:05:51,963 --> 01:05:56,582
Never were truer words spoken.
This calls for a toast. To our friendship!

838
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,342
I would move Heaven
and Earth for you, mi amigo.

839
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:02,507
But in the movie,
Don Hidalgo poisons the drink.

840
01:06:03,016 --> 01:06:05,598
—Salud!
-Poison!

841
01:06:07,937 --> 01:06:11,270
That night, Ernesto. The night I left...

842
01:06:12,233 --> 01:06:14,189
We'd been performing on the road
for months. I got homesick...

843
01:06:16,404 --> 01:06:17,940
and I packed up my songs.

844
01:06:18,781 --> 01:06:22,148
You want to give up now when
we're this close to reaching our dream?

845
01:06:22,285 --> 01:06:24,116
This was your dream. You'll manage.

846
01:06:24,245 --> 01:06:25,951
I can't do this
without your songs, Héctor.

847
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,743
I'm going home, Ernesto. Hate me
if you want, but my mind is made up.

848
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:39,216
I could never hate you. If you must go,
then I'm sending you off with a toast.

849
01:06:43,014 --> 01:06:44,299
To our friendship.

850
01:06:44,474 --> 01:06:48,638
Iwould move Heaven and Earth for you,
mi amigo. Saludl

851
01:06:53,733 --> 01:06:57,476
You walked me to the train station.
But I felt a pain in my stomach.

852
01:06:58,404 --> 01:06:59,985
I thought
it must have been something I ate.

853
01:07:00,156 --> 01:07:01,987
Perhaps it was that chorizo, my friend.

854
01:07:02,659 --> 01:07:04,866
Or something I drank.

855
01:07:08,498 --> 01:07:10,238
I woke up dead.

856
01:07:12,168 --> 01:07:14,329
You poisoned me.

857
01:07:14,504 --> 01:07:17,746
You're confusing movies
with reality, Héctor.

858
01:07:17,924 --> 01:07:21,166
All this time,
I thought it was just bad luck.

859
01:07:22,595 --> 01:07:24,506
I never thought that you might have--
That you...

860
01:07:30,478 --> 01:07:32,059
-How could you?
-Héctor!

861
01:07:32,188 --> 01:07:33,143
Security! Security!

862
01:07:34,524 --> 01:07:38,142
You took everything away from me!
You rat!

863
01:07:39,612 --> 01:07:42,069
Have him taken care of. He's not well.

864
01:07:42,615 --> 01:07:46,403
Ijust wanted to go back home. No! No!

865
01:07:48,788 --> 01:07:51,996
I apologize. Where were we?

866
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:54,491
You were going to
give me your blessing.

867
01:07:54,669 --> 01:07:56,830
Yes. Sr’.

868
01:07:59,757 --> 01:08:02,874
Miguel, my reputation...

869
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:09,180
It is very important to me.
I would hate to have you think...

870
01:08:09,309 --> 01:08:12,722
That you murdered
Héctor for his songs?

871
01:08:14,897 --> 01:08:17,764
You don't think that. Do you?

872
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:22,485
|-- No.
Everyone knows you're the good guy.

873
01:08:29,412 --> 01:08:31,903
Papa Ernesto, my blessing?

874
01:08:34,584 --> 01:08:39,044
Security? Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

875
01:08:39,172 --> 01:08:41,504
What? But I'm your family!

876
01:08:41,632 --> 01:08:43,748
And Héctor was my best friend.

877
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,919
Success doesn't come for free, Miguel.

878
01:08:48,056 --> 01:08:52,846
You have to be willing to do
whatever it takes to seize your moment.

879
01:08:54,062 --> 01:08:55,598
I know you understand.

880
01:08:55,772 --> 01:08:57,763
No! No!

881
01:08:59,942 --> 01:09:02,809
Let go! No!

882
01:09:25,426 --> 01:09:31,797
Help! Can anyone hear me?
I want to go home.

883
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,150
-Héctor?
-Kid?

884
01:09:52,328 --> 01:09:57,994
Héctor! You were right.
I should have gone back to my family.

885
01:09:58,167 --> 01:10:02,410
They told me not to be like de la Cruz,
but I didn't listen.

886
01:10:02,505 --> 01:10:05,338
I told them
I didn't care if they remembered me.

887
01:10:05,508 --> 01:10:08,500
I didn't care if I was
on their stupid ofrenda.

888
01:10:08,636 --> 01:10:11,378
Hey, chamaco. It's okay. It's okay.

889
01:10:11,514 --> 01:10:13,971
Itold them I didn't care.

890
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:20,853
Héctor! Héctor?

891
01:10:21,899 --> 01:10:24,515
She's forgetting me.

892
01:10:25,445 --> 01:10:28,357
-Who?
-My daughter.

893
01:10:30,825 --> 01:10:34,738
She's the reason
you wanted to cross the bridge.

894
01:10:35,621 --> 01:10:41,036
I just wanted to see her again.
I never should have left Santa Cecilia.

895
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:44,501
I wish I could apologize.

896
01:10:44,881 --> 01:10:47,873
I wish I could tell her that
her papa was trying to come home.

897
01:10:48,885 --> 01:10:51,001
That he loved her so much.

898
01:10:53,389 --> 01:10:54,799
My Coco...

899
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,970
Coco?

900
01:11:15,495 --> 01:11:17,531
Where did you get this?

901
01:11:18,289 --> 01:11:22,202
That's my Mama Coco.
That's my Mama Imelda.

902
01:11:23,252 --> 01:11:26,039
Is that you?

903
01:11:29,926 --> 01:11:33,214
We're... family?

904
01:11:45,775 --> 01:11:50,269
I always hoped I'd see her again.
That she'd miss me.

905
01:11:50,947 --> 01:11:54,610
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.

906
01:11:55,952 --> 01:11:57,237
You know the worst part?

907
01:11:57,787 --> 01:12:00,449
Even if I never got to see Coco
in the living world...

908
01:12:00,623 --> 01:12:05,538
I thought at least one day I'd see
her here. Give her the biggest hug.

909
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,337
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

910
01:12:11,342 --> 01:12:13,503
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

911
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:19,556
You disappear... from this one.
You'll never get to see her.

912
01:12:19,725 --> 01:12:21,306
Ever again.

913
01:12:24,605 --> 01:12:27,096
You know, I wrote her a song once.

914
01:12:27,817 --> 01:12:31,230
We used to sing it every night
at the same time.

915
01:12:31,904 --> 01:12:34,145
No matter how far apart we were.

916
01:12:35,491 --> 01:12:40,827
What I wouldn't give to sing it to her
one... last... time.

917
01:12:42,832 --> 01:12:45,995
Remember me

918
01:12:46,502 --> 01:12:50,836
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me

919
01:12:52,675 --> 01:12:55,587
Don't let it make you cry

920
01:12:55,678 --> 01:13:00,843
For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart

921
01:13:00,975 --> 01:13:06,265
I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart

922
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:10,181
Remember me

923
01:13:10,776 --> 01:13:11,811
Papa’!

924
01:13:11,944 --> 01:13:16,028
Though I have to travel far
Remember me

925
01:13:17,325 --> 01:13:20,533
Each time you hear a sad guitar

926
01:13:21,203 --> 01:13:26,948
Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be

927
01:13:29,295 --> 01:13:33,504
Until you're in my arms again

928
01:13:35,718 --> 01:13:42,055
Remember me

929
01:13:48,189 --> 01:13:51,397
He stole your guitar.
He stole your songs.

930
01:13:52,234 --> 01:13:55,726
You should be the one the world
remembers, not de la Cruz!

931
01:13:55,905 --> 01:14:00,069
I didn't write Remember Me
for the world. I wrote it for Coco.

932
01:14:02,286 --> 01:14:04,402
I'm a pretty sorry excuse
for a great-great-grandpa.

933
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:08,448
Are you kidding? A minute ago
I thought I was related to a murderer.

934
01:14:08,584 --> 01:14:13,374
You're a total upgrade.
My whole life, there's been something...

935
01:14:13,547 --> 01:14:17,085
that made me different.
And I never knew where it came from.

936
01:14:17,802 --> 01:14:20,418
But now I know. It comes from you.

937
01:14:21,555 --> 01:14:26,720
I'm proud we're family!
I'm proud to be his family!

938
01:14:33,776 --> 01:14:36,813
I'm proud to be his family!

939
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,791
Dante?

940
01:14:54,964 --> 01:14:56,170
Dante!

941
01:14:58,467 --> 01:15:00,082
It's Dante!

942
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:14,142
-Imelda!
-Héctor.

943
01:15:15,025 --> 01:15:16,356
You look good.

944
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:30,993
Dante! You knew he was my
Papa Héctor the whole time!

945
01:15:31,167 --> 01:15:33,078
You are a real spirit guide.

946
01:15:33,252 --> 01:15:35,664
Who's the good spirit guide? You are!

947
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,060
Dante!

948
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,710
There they are!

949
01:16:21,884 --> 01:16:26,503
Miguel! Miguelito! Look, it's Miguel!
He's all right.

950
01:16:27,473 --> 01:16:30,510
Gracias, Dios mlo.
Qué bueno.

951
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:48,949
Mr'jo, I was so worried!
Thank goodness we found you in time.

952
01:16:50,246 --> 01:16:53,738
And you... How many times
must I turn you away?

953
01:16:53,916 --> 01:16:54,621
Imelda.

954
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:58,083
I want nothing to do with you!
Not in life, not in death!

955
01:16:58,254 --> 01:17:01,712
I spent decades protecting my family
from your mistakes.

956
01:17:01,841 --> 01:17:05,254
He spends five minutes with you
and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!

957
01:17:05,427 --> 01:17:07,042
I wasn't in there because of Héctor.

958
01:17:07,179 --> 01:17:11,593
He was in there because of me.
He was just trying to get me home!

959
01:17:12,268 --> 01:17:15,760
I didn't want to listen, but he was right.

960
01:17:16,397 --> 01:17:18,262
Nothing's more important than family.

961
01:17:19,942 --> 01:17:22,604
I'm ready to accept your blessing.

962
01:17:22,778 --> 01:17:26,771
And your conditions.
But first, I need to find de la Cruz.

963
01:17:27,366 --> 01:17:29,106
To get Héctor's photo.

964
01:17:29,285 --> 01:17:30,616
-What?
-So he can see Coco again.

965
01:17:30,703 --> 01:17:34,070
Héctor should be on our ofrenda.
He's part of our family.

966
01:17:34,164 --> 01:17:35,324
He left this family!

967
01:17:35,457 --> 01:17:38,915
He tried to go home to you and Coco.
But de la Cruz murdered him!

968
01:17:40,254 --> 01:17:44,122
-It's true, Imelda.
-And so what if it's true?

969
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,461
You leave me alone
with a child to raise...

970
01:17:46,635 --> 01:17:48,626
and I'm just supposed to forgive you?

971
01:17:48,804 --> 01:17:49,793
Imelda, I--

972
01:17:50,764 --> 01:17:52,004
Héctor!

973
01:17:54,894 --> 01:17:58,136
I'm running out of time. It's Coco.

974
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,896
She's forgetting you.

975
01:18:02,234 --> 01:18:07,024
You don't have to forgive him.
But we shouldn't forget him.

976
01:18:09,575 --> 01:18:11,861
I wanted to forget you.

977
01:18:13,162 --> 01:18:15,904
I wanted Coco to forget you too, but...

978
01:18:16,081 --> 01:18:18,663
This is my fault. Not yours.

979
01:18:21,086 --> 01:18:22,872
I'm sorry, Imelda.

980
01:18:27,176 --> 01:18:32,296
Miguel, if we help you get his photo,
you will return home?

981
01:18:32,848 --> 01:18:33,837
No more music?

982
01:18:35,184 --> 01:18:37,470
Family comes first.

983
01:18:39,855 --> 01:18:42,972
I can't forgive you.

984
01:18:45,152 --> 01:18:46,688
But I will help you.

985
01:18:49,823 --> 01:18:51,063
So, how do we get to de la Cruz?

986
01:18:52,117 --> 01:18:54,483
I might know a way.

987
01:19:45,254 --> 01:19:47,336
—Good luck, muchacho.
-Gracias, Frida.

988
01:19:56,348 --> 01:19:58,088
-Here, let me help you with--
-Don't touch me!

989
01:19:59,184 --> 01:20:01,345
-Everyone clear on the plan?
-Find Héctor's photo.

990
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,351
-Give it to Miguel.
—Send Miguel home.

991
01:20:03,605 --> 01:20:04,720
Got your petals?

992
01:20:06,442 --> 01:20:08,103
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz.

993
01:20:08,277 --> 01:20:09,016
Yes?

994
01:20:10,487 --> 01:20:12,023
Don't I know you?

995
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:15,234
That's for murdering the love of my life!

996
01:20:15,367 --> 01:20:17,699
-Who-- Who the--
-She's talking about me!

997
01:20:17,870 --> 01:20:20,612
-I'm the love of your life?
-I don't know. I'm still angry at you.

998
01:20:20,748 --> 01:20:22,158
Héctor! How did you--

999
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:25,078
And that's for trying to
murder my grandson.

1000
01:20:25,294 --> 01:20:27,034
-Grandson?
-She's talking about me!

1001
01:20:27,629 --> 01:20:31,542
You! Wait. You're related to Héctor?

1002
01:20:31,759 --> 01:20:32,794
The photo!

1003
01:20:37,306 --> 01:20:38,421
After him!

1004
01:20:40,601 --> 01:20:42,637
Security! Ayudenme!

1005
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:45,682
-You said love of your life.
-I don't know what I said.

1006
01:20:45,814 --> 01:20:46,929
That's what I heard.

1007
01:21:00,829 --> 01:21:02,820
Places, Senor.
You're on in thirty seconds.

1008
01:21:09,505 --> 01:21:12,087
Ay! Miguel! I have it!

1009
01:21:28,023 --> 01:21:29,433
Hurry! Come on!

1010
01:21:31,652 --> 01:21:32,858
Ladies and gentlemen...

1011
01:21:33,028 --> 01:21:38,944
the one... the only...
Ernesto de la Cruz!

1012
01:21:48,043 --> 01:21:49,283
Get her off the stage.

1013
01:21:58,053 --> 01:22:00,214
Sing! Sing!

1014
01:22:06,395 --> 01:22:11,560
Ay, de mi Llorona

1015
01:22:12,442 --> 01:22:17,277
Llorona de azul celeste

1016
01:22:19,575 --> 01:22:23,614
Ay, de mi Llorona

1017
01:22:24,913 --> 01:22:29,077
Llorona de azul celeste

1018
01:22:31,545 --> 01:22:35,754
Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona

1019
01:22:36,383 --> 01:22:44,552
No dejaré de quererte

1020
01:22:46,768 --> 01:22:50,431
Me subi al pino mas alto, Llorona

1021
01:22:50,606 --> 01:22:53,018
A ver site divisaba

1022
01:22:53,192 --> 01:22:57,105
Como el pino era tierno, Llorona

1023
01:22:57,863 --> 01:23:00,855
AI verme Ilorar, lloraba

1024
01:23:01,033 --> 01:23:07,654
Ay de mi Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul celeste

1025
01:23:08,081 --> 01:23:14,873
Ay de mi Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul celeste

1026
01:23:15,214 --> 01:23:19,048
Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona

1027
01:23:19,218 --> 01:23:22,176
No dejaré de quererte

1028
01:23:22,304 --> 01:23:25,967
-Let go of me!
-Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona

1029
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:37,818
No dejaré de quererte

1030
01:23:38,487 --> 01:23:40,978
A y, ay, 3}’

1031
01:23:49,873 --> 01:23:51,829
I forgot what that felt like.

1032
01:23:52,292 --> 01:23:54,658
You still got it.

1033
01:24:00,801 --> 01:24:03,508
Miguel, I give you my blessing.

1034
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:10,675
To go home, to put up our photos
and to never--

1035
01:24:10,852 --> 01:24:12,558
Never play music again.

1036
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:18,941
To never forget
how much your family loves you.

1037
01:24:21,863 --> 01:24:23,148
You're going home.

1038
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:28,321
You're not going anywhere.

1039
01:24:30,289 --> 01:24:31,369
Imelda!

1040
01:24:31,707 --> 01:24:36,997
Stay back! Stay back! All of you,
stay back. Not one more step.

1041
01:24:38,922 --> 01:24:40,503
Dante!

1042
01:24:41,633 --> 01:24:45,922
Ernesto, stop! Leave the boy alone.

1043
01:24:46,054 --> 01:24:50,172
I've worked too hard, Héctor.
Too hard to let him destroy everything.

1044
01:24:50,309 --> 01:24:52,391
He's a living child, Ernesto.

1045
01:24:52,561 --> 01:24:53,892
He's a threat!

1046
01:24:54,062 --> 01:24:57,554
You think I'd let him go back to
the Land of the Living with your photo?

1047
01:24:57,691 --> 01:25:00,728
To keep your memory alive? No.

1048
01:25:00,861 --> 01:25:03,273
-You're a coward!
-I am Ernesto de la Cruz.

1049
01:25:03,405 --> 01:25:05,396
The greatest musician of all time!

1050
01:25:05,532 --> 01:25:07,363
Héctor's the real musician.

1051
01:25:07,492 --> 01:25:09,983
You're just the guy who murdered him
and stole his songs!

1052
01:25:10,078 --> 01:25:10,988
Murdered?

1053
01:25:11,121 --> 01:25:15,034
I am the one who's willing to do
what it takes to seize my moment.

1054
01:25:16,126 --> 01:25:17,206
Whatever it takes.

1055
01:25:19,755 --> 01:25:20,835
No!

1056
01:25:23,008 --> 01:25:24,214
Miguel!

1057
01:25:25,093 --> 01:25:28,426
Apologies, old friend.
But the show must go on.

1058
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,380
Please, please, mi familia.

1059
01:26:13,517 --> 01:26:15,348
Murderer!

1060
01:26:15,477 --> 01:26:17,809
Orchestra. A-one, a-two, a-one--

1061
01:26:20,649 --> 01:26:24,312
Remember me
Though I have to s-- Hey!

1062
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:27,273
Look!

1063
01:26:48,093 --> 01:26:49,333
Nice kitty.

1064
01:26:53,181 --> 01:26:58,266
Put me down! No, please! I beg of you!
Stop! Stop! No!

1065
01:27:06,653 --> 01:27:08,143
No! No!

1066
01:27:20,167 --> 01:27:21,247
What did I miss?

1067
01:27:21,543 --> 01:27:22,999
Good boy, Dante!

1068
01:27:23,295 --> 01:27:24,501
Miguel!

1069
01:27:25,964 --> 01:27:29,877
Héctor! The photo... I lost it!

1070
01:27:30,469 --> 01:27:32,460
It's okay, mr'jo. It's 0--

1071
01:27:33,305 --> 01:27:35,796
Héctor! Héctor?

1072
01:27:37,142 --> 01:27:38,006
Coco.

1073
01:27:38,143 --> 01:27:40,054
No! We can still find the photo.

1074
01:27:40,645 --> 01:27:42,260
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.

1075
01:27:43,565 --> 01:27:45,055
No, no. I can't leave you.

1076
01:27:45,358 --> 01:27:49,818
I promised I'd put your photo up.
I promised you'd see Coco.

1077
01:27:49,988 --> 01:27:51,979
We're both out of time, mr'jo.

1078
01:27:53,408 --> 01:27:56,571
Oh no! No! She can't forget you!

1079
01:27:56,745 --> 01:28:00,579
Ijust wanted her to know
that I loved her.

1080
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:05,534
-Héctor!
-You have our blessing, Miguel.

1081
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:06,910
No conditions.

1082
01:28:08,089 --> 01:28:10,796
No! Papa Héctor, please!

1083
01:28:15,055 --> 01:28:16,090
No!

1084
01:28:17,682 --> 01:28:21,516
—Go home.
-I promise I won't let Coco forget you!

1085
01:28:48,755 --> 01:28:49,961
There he is!

1086
01:28:51,424 --> 01:28:53,335
Miguel! Stop!

1087
01:28:58,473 --> 01:29:01,306
-Where have you been?
-I need to see Mama Coco, please.

1088
01:29:01,476 --> 01:29:04,138
What are you doing with that--
Give it to me!

1089
01:29:04,813 --> 01:29:09,147
Miguel, stop! Miguel! Miguel!

1090
01:29:10,485 --> 01:29:14,273
Mama Coco?
Can you hear me? It's Miguel.

1091
01:29:14,948 --> 01:29:18,440
I saw your papa. Remember? Papa?

1092
01:29:19,786 --> 01:29:25,281
Please! If you forget him,
he'll be gone. Forever.

1093
01:29:26,042 --> 01:29:27,157
Miguel, open this door!

1094
01:29:27,335 --> 01:29:31,749
Here. This was his guitar, right?
He used to play it to you?

1095
01:29:34,634 --> 01:29:40,504
See? There he is! Papa!
Remember? Papa?

1096
01:29:44,185 --> 01:29:48,019
-Miguel!
-Mama Coco, please! Don't forget him.

1097
01:29:54,779 --> 01:29:57,566
What are you doing to that poor
woman? It's okay, Mamita. It's okay.

1098
01:29:57,699 --> 01:29:59,189
What's gotten into you?

1099
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:07,702
I thought I'd lost you, Miguel.

1100
01:30:07,876 --> 01:30:09,286
I'm sorry, Papa.

1101
01:30:09,461 --> 01:30:12,498
We're all together now.
That's what matters.

1102
01:30:13,548 --> 01:30:14,663
Not all of us.

1103
01:30:14,799 --> 01:30:19,964
It's okay, Mamita. Miguel,
you apologize to your Mama Coco.

1104
01:30:23,391 --> 01:30:24,801
Mama Coco?

1105
01:30:29,564 --> 01:30:31,304
Well? Apologize!

1106
01:30:35,695 --> 01:30:41,486
Mama Coco?
Your papa, he wanted you to have this.

1107
01:30:43,411 --> 01:30:45,197
Mama, wait!

1108
01:30:45,372 --> 01:30:49,206
Remember me

1109
01:30:50,543 --> 01:30:53,330
Though I have to say goodbye

1110
01:30:53,505 --> 01:30:56,087
Remember me

1111
01:30:56,758 --> 01:30:59,420
Don't let it make you cry

1112
01:30:59,594 --> 01:31:03,086
For even if I'm far away

1113
01:31:03,264 --> 01:31:09,100
I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you

1114
01:31:09,229 --> 01:31:12,437
Each night we are apart

1115
01:31:13,191 --> 01:31:16,524
Remember me

1116
01:31:17,445 --> 01:31:20,528
Though I have to travel far

1117
01:31:20,657 --> 01:31:23,319
Remember me

1118
01:31:23,451 --> 01:31:27,114
Each time you hear a sad guitar

1119
01:31:28,456 --> 01:31:34,292
Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be

1120
01:31:36,297 --> 01:31:40,586
Until you're in my arms again

1121
01:31:42,387 --> 01:31:48,178
Remember me

1122
01:31:55,817 --> 01:31:58,934
Elena? What's wrong, mr'ja?

1123
01:32:00,155 --> 01:32:03,943
Nothing, Mama. Nothing at all.

1124
01:32:04,993 --> 01:32:08,326
My papa used to sing me that song.

1125
01:32:08,997 --> 01:32:11,113
He loved you, Mama Coco.

1126
01:32:11,791 --> 01:32:15,409
Your papa loved you so much.

1127
01:32:34,022 --> 01:32:37,355
I kept his letters.

1128
01:32:38,026 --> 01:32:42,269
Poems he wrote me. And...

1129
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,382
Papa was a musician.

1130
01:33:05,053 --> 01:33:06,793
When I was a little girl...

1131
01:33:09,557 --> 01:33:12,720
he and Mama
would sing such beautiful songs.

1132
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:29,574
And right over here, one of
Santa Cecilia's greatest treasures.

1133
01:33:29,828 --> 01:33:33,412
The home of the esteemed song writer,
Héctor Rivera.

1134
01:33:34,207 --> 01:33:37,825
The letters Héctor wrote home for
his daughter, Coco, contain the lyrics...

1135
01:33:38,002 --> 01:33:41,540
for all of your favorite songs.
Not just Remember Me.

1136
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:47,592
And that man is your Papa Julio.

1137
01:33:47,762 --> 01:33:50,925
And there's Tr’a Rosita
and your Tia Victoria.

1138
01:33:51,099 --> 01:33:53,932
And those two are Oscar and Felipe.

1139
01:33:54,602 --> 01:33:57,059
These aren'tjust old pictures,
they're our family...

1140
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:59,266
and they're counting on us
to remember them.

1141
01:34:17,125 --> 01:34:22,370
Say that I'm crazy or call me a fool

1142
01:34:26,509 --> 01:34:28,420
Enjoy your visit, Héctor.

1143
01:34:30,305 --> 01:34:33,138
But last night it seemed that
I dreamed about you

1144
01:34:36,561 --> 01:34:39,473
-Papa!
-Coco!

1145
01:34:39,647 --> 01:34:44,311
When I opened my mouth
what came out was a song

1146
01:34:44,485 --> 01:34:50,151
And you know every word
and we all sang along

1147
01:34:53,703 --> 01:34:57,446
To a melody played
on the strings of our souls

1148
01:34:57,624 --> 01:35:02,414
And a rhythm that rattled us
down to the bone

1149
01:35:02,587 --> 01:35:07,331
Our love for each other
will live on forever

1150
01:35:08,927 --> 01:35:13,842
In every beat of my proud corazon

1151
01:35:14,015 --> 01:35:18,509
Our love for each other
will live on forever

1152
01:35:19,854 --> 01:35:24,439
In every beat of my proud corazon

1153
01:35:27,862 --> 01:35:31,901
A y mi familia
Oiga mi gente

1154
01:35:32,325 --> 01:35:36,159
Canten a coro
Let it be known

1155
01:35:36,329 --> 01:35:39,992
Our love for each other
will live on forever

1156
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:44,159
In every beat of my proud corazon

1157
01:35:44,796 --> 01:35:48,789
A y mi familia
Oiga mi gente

1158
01:35:48,925 --> 01:35:52,588
Canten a coro
Let it be known

1159
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:54,756
Our love for each other
will live on forever

1160
01:35:56,724 --> 01:36:01,184
In every beat of my proud corazon
